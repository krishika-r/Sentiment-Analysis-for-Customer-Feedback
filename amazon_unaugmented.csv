"The Word 2007 has a completely different interface than Word 2002 and requires new orientation.

Excel 2007 does not recognize Microsoft Works Database.

Have not nor probably will not use the One Note software but was not afforded the opportunity not to load the program."
"This is simply a great magazine for kids!  It has short, informative stories/articles and lots of them -- some a couple pages long and some a couple paragraphs longs.  The pictures are amazing -- it IS National Geographic after all.

Lots of different animals per issue and always interesting!

100% recommended!"
I bought this shampoo to go in wedding guest gift bags who are joining us on a cruise. I wanted something that was natural and this little tube of shampoo fit the bill. I also recieved an email from the company thanking me for my purchase and thought that was a nice customer service touch. I will definitely be exploring their other products and recommend this company.
"A plethora of recipes from all categories; appetizers, main courses, deserts, etc... The recipes are primarily 'light' but there are many desert & main course meals that are 'hearty' and not for the dieter in pursuit of lean cuisine. Overall a good source of suggestions for meals one might not normally think of. My one concern is that many of the recipes are based on products only available in the U.S. market. I work overseas, and receive this subscription there, where many of these products are unavailable."
"Overall, it does work as advertised.  However, the product itself feels cheap.  I too get error messages (Windows 8.1).  The software is pretty basic, so you may to pick up another editor to help clean up your files after transfer if you want a little more ability."
Perfict fit for me. Great looking shoes at a great price.
This seems to get thinner with every issue- I miss the original and some of the features like the insight into a celebrity fridge.  Recipes are easy though.
"I found the program to integrate quite well with Tax Cut 2003. The program transferred most vital information to my current filing including required federal tax payee numbers (a pet peave of mine from last year).

To me, the Deluxe version was the best value. It includes a rebate for the State program and for e-filing. It also offers a $5 rebate for itself unless you opt for the Microsoft 2005 Money option.

The signature edition was tempting but means little unless it is backed by a CPA. A review by a part-time H&R Block employee is little motivation for shelling out the additional %50.00."
"I like the way Roxio packaged features into this version.  It gives the novice media junkie a good platform to work from when detailing specific video information.  You can edit photos, video, audio and then turn around drop it to a DVD, or flash drive.  It's a great starter package for the beginner, those more advanced will probably find the platform a bit mundane and repetitive.

If you want to test the editing waters then wade in my friend, this is certainly the package deal for you.  It's not complicated or hard to understand, be sure to follow directions when installing and have tech support on speed dial if you run into issues.  You get a really good basic video and photo editor all rolled up in one!"

It is both easy and fun to use--yet it contains a wealth of advance features that will enable you to create complex drawings and paintings. I've included a video to show some of the features of this program.

I've also created review videos of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Photoshop-Elements-13/dp/B00NNZNTAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Photoshop Elements 13</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-Painter-2015/dp/B00LYYMXF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel Painter 2015</a>&nbsp;so you could view those to see how those programs compare to Sketchbook. Hopefully this will enable you to select the best software depending on what you want to do!

One of the main reasons why I like Sketchook Pro for drawing is that the pencil tool provides the closest sensation to sketching with traditional pencil and paper of any software program that I've used. Combine Sketchbook Pro 7 with a pressure sensitive laptop, tablet, or Wacom Cintiq monitor and the experience is very similar to using a pencil on paper.

Another major reason I like Sketchbook is the simplicity of the interface.  The workspace is not filled up with menu bars and palettes. If you are using a small monitor, laptop, or tablet you will really appreciate this feature.

Here is a list of other features that I really like.

1. The variety of brushes, pencils, markers, etc. and the ability to change the brushes and create your own.

2. This is an easy program to learn--at least the basics.  It does have advanced features--but you can create a lot of good drawings or paintings by just knowing the basics.

3. The Symmetry feature--I like drawing faces and this makes it really easy. A NEW feature of Sketchbook Pro 7 is you can reposition the Symmetry axis to different parts of your image.  Basically you can use it to create an object in one part of your image and then drag it to a new part and use it there.

4. The NEW Perspective Guide feature.  This is going to make drawing in perspective a LOT easier!

5. The NEW layer features including Background Color Layer and the ability to use Layer Groups.

6. The NEW flip book animation feature looks great--I just need more time to try it out!

There are also several other new features of Sketchbook Pro 7 that I believe will be very useful. They include the Glow and Soft Glow blend modes, the ability to distort and transform selections and layers, and the new Gradient Fill feature.

There is a great online manual that can be accessed by clicking on the ""Help"" link on the menu bar.  I created a short video segment on this but I had to remove it to keep the video under 10 minutes.  The manual includes very good directions on how to use the various features.  It can be downloaded and saved on your computer.

My usual workflow is to start out a sketch in Sketchbook Pro and then I bring it into Photoshop or Painter to finish it. Sketchbook Pro does include all the features necessary to start and complete a drawing or image--and I've seen some wonderful images done completely with Sketchbook Pro--but Photoshop and Painter still have advanced features that I've grown accustomed to using.

Bottom line: When it comes to pure sketching--Sketchbook Pro 7 is my first choice.  Combined with a pressure sensitive tablet or monitor it doesn't get any more natural feeling than this."
"I've just set up the Sage 50 accounting system, and it was quite easy (have set up Sage several years ago).

Pros:
-Easy set up
-Can handle large or little accounting needs

Cons:
-Pricey, but worth it if you want to go beyond QuickBooks"
"If you have dialup NEVER purchase this product. Why?

1) If you have automatic updates ON, it eats up your bandwidth so you can do NOTHING on the Internet until the update completes. Neat. I thought I purchased my computers to use, not to maintain and I purchased this absolutely worthless product to protect me while I was on the Internet

2) If you have automatic updates OFF (which is the only way you can use it given (1, then you basically have to do the updates manually when you know that you will not be using your computer. Great.

3) I have a half dozen licenses for this product. However, because Windows XP is little more than a continuing security exposure, I only use one computer on this Internet, this one. The ONLY time the other computers are on the Internet is for software updates. Normally, therefore, I only update NIS 2006 on a monthly basis or so (Since it is not needed. If you read 4) & 5) you can see why there is absolutely no incentive to update this product at all since it is just a problem). The problem is that essentially 100% of the time, when I attempt to update NIS 2006, it crashes (Internal error, etc).

4) I live in the sticks so that DSL is not available, therefore I am stuck with dialup. (Satellite is not acceptable for many, many reasons, btw). The consequences of 3), that NIS 2006 always ALWAYS crashes during the update process, is that all updates have to be done piecemeal, one at a time as I try to find some workaround to get it to update. The problem with this, is that even the individual updates fail (Internal error) Therefore I have to spend hours updating each computer: Updates | Select individual update from list | LONG download | Internal error. Repeat || Try another individual update from list | LONG download | Internal error. So, as I said, I have to spend hours trying to find some workaround for EACH computer trying to get NIS 2006 to ever update.

5) The consequences of 1) and 3), is there is an extremely strong disincentive to update NIS 2006 at all (Besides the fact that every once in awhile your license spontaneously EXPIRES and you have to solve that problem in addition). The end result of this is that I spend far more time trying to update NIS 2006 than I actually spend doing anything productive. (Then there is that wonderful Windows ""Genuine Advantage"", that makes the Windows update process miserable)

6) I would estimate that I end up doing several failed UPDATES, before this piece of junk finally updates, properly. That is a lot of time at 28.8K to 38.6K

Symantec has BILLIONS of dollars for acquisitions yet they don't give a damn about providing a product than even works (and they never will give a damn or provide a product that works) (BTW, I notice that as the years progress, almost all software is getting even more unreliable)

Hopefully, I have made my point (The real shame is that the other products have their own problems, as well, so you are pretty well damned if you do and damned if you don't)

Excellent product would recommend parallel to anyone Easy to install and product support if needed
"I have over 16 Magazine subscriptions, 10 of them being Cooking Magazines. Saveur provides you with a different sort of cooking magazine, definately with a heavy intent on the background of food, their articles are more in depth about the locations and even the layout of the magazine is different.
If you enjoy this magazine there is a web-site that you absolutely must check out it's called ""ethnic grocer"" you can find all of the rare ingredients that you find in some of the recipes that are featured in Saveur. I always feel like I've actually walked in the shoes of the writer and the articles are so vivid that you can almost taste the exotic-ness <---- is that word?) LOL of the flavors. If you can get the subscription at a good price, GO FOR IT!
A warning though be prepared to want to immediately run out get a passport and travel to the locations that are featured.
Happy Reading"
"I use my server box as a file server, and that's really about it. This will do that job, and costs a LOT less than Windows Server 2008 R2/2012 + CAL.

Granted, you lose a lot of the functions that the full server product can do, but, the server box I have (HP N40L Proliant Microserver) doesn't have the power to run Hyper-V...tested that...and nope. the 8GB RAM limit puts a damper on that idea too...

Anyhow, I have used WHS2011 a while back as well (N36L server - sold it with the box), and I could get it to do SOME media functions, but, never had enough interest in it to figure it out more than ""OK, it sort of works""

Just be aware that there is LITTLE in the way of anti-virus solutions...MSSE won't install, Symantec Internet Security won't either. Probably could use AVG or some other free AV, but I don't trust that stuff..."
"I love the features this offers.  I can sync my itouch with my mac without even docking it.  my calendar, addressbook and email are all automatically updated.  it also updates pictures. it does this all through push technology.  with itouch you have to be in a wifi spot to sync without docking.  with iphone you just have to be where you get service.  also, all information is on web so you can look it up from any computer if you forget your itouch.  had i known about this, i probably would have saved the money on my blackberry and just kept a regular cell phone and then purchased this for my itouch.  blackberry's have lots of problems syncing with macs so i am very excited about this program because i can keep my information with me on my itouch.

i forgot to add that this keeps my multiple mac laptops synced with each other without me having to do anything.

I have used this product for almost a year now.  I purchased it again to renew it as it is cheaper usually to do that through amazon.  One thing to remember is that if you catch it at a good price, you can renew anytime during your membership and it will add another year to your membership--even if you are only 1 day in.  I know some people that bought 5 and have 5 years worth--there doesn't seem to be a limit to how long apple will let you pay in advance.

I think it is worth every penny.  there is usually a 60 day free trial through apple if you want to check it out."
"It was okay.  I bought this for last years taxes.  I prefer turbo tax more, but I bought this because turbo tax changed some of its forms.  For the most part, I would say it's easy to navigate and use."
Grandchildren read and talk about it.
I like reading Reader's Digest since I was a kid. It has great information about the everyday life here in America.
"I finally ended up uninstalling this on my main PC. Most of my systems have Windows 10 on them, and even though it is supposed to be compatible, it didn't work. In addition, it took a lot of resources to work. It doesn't help that W10 takes up a lot of resources already.

I'm an Adobe user. If you are familiar with the product then you know it's not the easiest to use.  So I use Corel VS7 for those faster projects. I was hoping to use this one for when my grand daughter wants to make home movies.  I have a laptop with Windows 8.1 on it. I will try that one"
"Anti-virus and spyware programs offer some of the choicest morsels in the freeware phenomenon.

 This program is typical of its commercial genre: big, slow and a resource hog. Anti-virus and spyware programs should be left to run t night or whenever else you are not using the computer.

 I don't have any kind of formal procedure for testing spyware programs. I run a commercial anti-virus and spyware package and occasionally run freeware programs to see how each performs against the others. PCTools Spyware Doctor isn't perfect when measured against competitors. It didn't miss anything on my pretty clean system, nor did it find anything the others didn't. Identifying actual malware from entities such as legitimate Registry entries and Cookies is as tedious as it is with other programs and not as bad as some others. The great danger of these programs is that for many users, they are dangerous weapons - it is very simple to delete a critical Registry entry.

 Overall, I think experienced users would probably be just as happy - if not happier - with one of the well known freeware products. Inexperienced users might be better served with a better featured program that includes anti-virus capabilities.

It;s OK but nothing special about it....it's a magazine.
Accurate and fast!
I have used quicken for years and this is a nice upgrade. The upgrade process went smoothly and the system works well.
Excellent product.
"The Linden soap is an absolute delight. OMG it smells so very good. Honestly I'm not really sure what Linden is, but oh, I so love this!
Quality of the soap is high, I find it more delicately scented and just a better quality soap than Lush soaps.
These soaps are great for home use, as a guesting gift, or anything really.
Five stars!"
Gift.
"Lots of competitors, just marketing differences.  Doesn't do anything new or differently than the  others and I own most of those, too.  If you don't have a burning program then this is as good as any, better than none."
"I installed Trend Micro on Vista.  Installation was fast and painless.  Then I familiarized myself with the console, which is pretty intuitive except that I might not get around to ever using the advanced options.  I ran a scan and several problems were identified and managed, and it was surprising how fast that went.  I switched to Trend Micro firewall as I don't see any reason to run a different firewall instead.

It seems that Trend Micro can work with the least amount of user management, which suites me, and without even communicating that it's there in the background running.  I'm really glad to have this full suite with antivirus, anti-spyware and Internet security all in one and not experience conflicts with any other software.  I might never use the features to secure confidential files because I offload files onto thumb drives regularly as I don't want to keep files long-term on any home computer with Internet connectivity.

Because this program is so unobtrusive and undemanding, I imagine I'll have no second thoughts about paying for next year once this year is up.  Plus, if I develop an interest in seeing the Security Activity Dashboard, familiarization will make me want to continue."
"I had problems with Magix Movie Edit Pro 2016 Plus software from the beginning. I upgraded to Windows 10, so I don't know if some of the issues I encountered were due to the upgrade, but the box states that Windows 10 is a compatible platform. One disclosure is that I have no GoPro or action camera footage that I was working on. I converted my old home videos to digital MP4 format and this was my primary source material. Many of the video tapes were half full while others had blue screen blanks that I wanted to delete.

First, I could not use the disk that I ordered. My laptop has a disk drive and successfully reads Kaspersky Internet Security disks, movies on disk, and other software I have ordered on disk. Ive never had an issue until this software, so I was forced to download it.

Once downloaded, I could not register the software, so I could not use it. I received a cryptic message (error -24 serial number is used by another email). Users need to email customer service first and wait to receive a trouble ticket before they can call. Once I received an emailed trouble ticket, I tried for more than a week to call a customer service number that I looked up on the Internet but there was never an answer. Finally, I discoveredd a number among the package literature and reached a live person. This person told me to uninstall & reinstall the software. The problem was that during the registration process where I am led along from screen to screen, I had used one email address for verifying registration and used a different one for product emails. This is a no-no, but I could not have known this in advance. So I uninstalled the software & downloaded it again.

Once it was registered properly, I watched the tutorials. I confess I did not wade through user blog forums. I had difficulties because in the tutorial, the sample screen and pointers to items were different than my own product screen. I could not find options that were shown on the tutorial. It was exasperating. Finally, I asked my brother to help me since he is the family movie maker and uses numerous, popular video/film software. He could not figure out what to do to work on a MP4 video during his visit and spent an hour or two fooling with the software features to no avail.

This software has an extremely steep learning curve and is unlike most of other popular film editing software.  I have been at this since May on and off. I dislike this software despite its host of features since it is not intuitive or user friendly."
"Rosetta Stone's language software is fantastic. Their total immersion approach makes it feel like a play along game instead of learning a language. I had a bit of French in college, but despite the fact that it was a beginning class, students were already expected to know some French. The software outclasses the traditional class. Setup is easy and you can select the options for your level to go at your own pace. Seeing the images with text and hearing the native speaker really does allow for faster learning and you do use your own native ability to learn to better effect. The new Audio Companion CDs are an excellent reinforcement. They make it so easy to load them into a CD player or an iPod. You never feel as pressured to learn the language. I have always wanted to learn French and am loving doing so. The software is nicely packaged with a Quick Start guide, User's Guide, application software and three levels of language for beginning, intermediate and advanced. There are also four CDs for each level for the Audio Companion and an included headset with microphone. It is pricey, but worth it. With regular practice you will become proficient and the software interface is very user friendly. I highly recommend Rosetta Stone and will stick with them for my language learning needs."
"I really like Kaspersky's computer security products.  They work really well, and have been keeping my computers in good condition for years.  What I really like about this one is the ability to put it on five devices.  I have multiple computers and a tablet.  I'm not a big smart phone user, but I have a number of computers that I need protected, and this allows me to get that all with one product.  I'm so happy that Kaspersky has come out with a license for more than three devices.  Recommended."
"I use software related to photography a lot, and have taught digital photography college classes for 20 years, so I have used a lot of video editing programs.  This is my first time using Pinnacle, however.  Previously I have used Adobe and Corel products.  As a result, I found this to be harder to use and less intuitive, although that could be because I am less familiar with it.  As another reviewer mentioned, it has some ""interesting"" defaults, but in general I found it to be about as capable as other programs I have used.  It does a good job of keeping sound synced, which can sometimes be an issue.  The price is also attractive.  Some video editing software is much more costly.  Although I had to do some clicking around to find what I wanted to do, I didn't encounter any particular feature that I wanted but was missing.  There are some instructional videos on their site, but they appear to be something you must pay for.  Since this is fairly inexpensive, it might make sense for those of you who just edit video occasionally.  It is a large installation, and I do wish it had given me more options during the install.  It installed a lot of ""bonus"" items I don't think I will ever use."
This product was researched by a co worker for an application we needed. I was looking for a place to purchase. This price was $20.00 less than any place I could find. The product worked as advertised.
"My hair feels soft after I started use them. They smell wonderful! If you are like me, asian, with lots of thick hair, that are prone to frizz, I think for this prize, it's worth trying them!"
"I'm not kidding when I say avoid Symantec as your Anti-Virus provider. This is probably one of the absolute worst companies I've dealt with.  VERY POOR support, and awful licensing structure. Worse, the myriad of useless web pages is not warming, to say the least.  Good luck finding/activating your updates and upgrades.

I admit that I'm not the swiftest when it comes to Symantec's solution, but I've had an easier time with Kaspersky, Sophos, Trend Micro, McAfee, AVG, F-PROT, avast, and Comodo.  I've even had better experience with older Symantec products not even five years ago.

So, if you want an exercise in futility, give 'em a go. Otherwise, save yourself some tears.

I will never buy another Norton/Symantec product again."
"I bought Norton Internet Security years ago when it first came out. While it didn't have all the features I would have liked, it was better than anything else I could find at the time.
Unfortunately, Symantec has since chosen to follow McAfee's lead in selling unbundled programs (It's better to sell 10 programs at $30 each than one integrated suite at $100), with conflicts between the programs, lots of bugs, no customer service, and a $30/year per program charge for updates.
The only way we can show our dissatisfaction with this sort of foolishness is to vote with our feet. So I'm offering the following alternative, hoping that other reviewers will suggest others.
Trend Micro has just come out with ""PC-cillin Internet Security 2004,"" an upgrade of ""PC-cillin 2003"" (a top-rated anti-virus program---see Amazon user reviews), which offers a personal firewall providing protection from network viruses, spam email, inappropriate web content, and Spyware programs.
If you do decide to move away from Symantec, you should be aware that the normal uninstall process will not remove all Symantec files from your computer (this has been a serious problem with Symantec from the beginning). In the case of Norton Anti-Virus and Norton Internet Security, the remaining files are likely to conflict with replacement software (they definitely do conflict with Trend Micro's products). To remove them, go to Symantec's website and download a file named ""RnisUPG.exe"". Run it, and it will remove the offending files."
"UPDATED REVIEW (My original review remains intact below)
--------------------
While I am still behind the general approach to this software, unfortunately, after making it quite a ways into the software, I have decided that the technical implementation--particularly around voice recognition--is so unbelievably poor as to make the software unusable.

Here are the big problems.

1. The voice recognition component is worthless.  At times even the most simple word (I can certainly pronounce ""drei"" in German) fails to recognize the word.  For fun--and to prove the point--go into the mode where you can repeat the word as often as you want and get an analysis of what you did right or wrong.  You can repeat a single, simple syllable over and over and watch the analysis be completely different every time.  The important part to notice is that it does not register a ""fail"" (as in, ""you said it wrong""); it simply does not take input from the microphone.  It registers an ""I did not hear you"" sound, and no amount of begging will convince it you are speaking.  At other times, I have discovered that the only way to get something ""right"" is to intentionally pronounce something wrongly--for example, anything like ""Ich"", ""Spreche"", etc. with a ""ch"" has a far better chance of success if pronounced as an English ""sh"" (as in ""she"", ""shy"") rather than the correct sound.

2. The Support is HORRIBLE.  When I contacted them to discuss the problemsabove, they told me (rather sarcastically) that I was simply not saying the phrase correctly.  This was ironic from ""Bob"", who clearly someone in need of ""Rosetta Stone for Residents of Bangalore"".  To illustrate that I am not completely incapable of repeating a very basic sound, I recorded the voice of the Rosetta Stone native speaker and played it back to the program.  It was wrong over 80% of the time.  When I pointed this out, the support organization then suggested that it was perhaps a problem with the microphone, and transferred me to a different department to give me the privilege of buying another microphone from them (gee, thanks... $600 for this software and you want me to buy another microphone because by your own admission the microphone you included is broken?  that seems ummm... really...  reasonable).

3. Rather than purchase the oh-so-cheap microphone, I elected to purchase a very nice microphone from SoundBlaster.  This product works great--for every piece of software except Rosetta Stone, which continues to be unable to understand even the most basic phrases.  I then tried a rather nice Logitech--same results--great precision everywhere else and nothing in Rosetta Stone.

4. The most frustrating part of this is that some days, Rosetta Stone will work just fine.  I can go through lesson after lesson with perfect scores; then suddenly it simply decides to fail.  Occasionally a reboot will help, but generally just for a few minutes, then it is back to being horrible.

Overall, it is a shame that a piece of software that is otherwise quite a good way to introduce you to a new language is (a) so insanely bad in a critical product area, and (b) the company refuses to recognize the deficiency.  This software is never going to make anyone a fluent speaker--even with these problems fixed--but if I knew I were being dropped into German in three months, it would certainly be something I believe would prepare me to get by and build the base I needed for eventual fluency after living there for a few years.

I think that the bottom line is that if you are willing to skip all the speaking lessons, you might really enjoy and get value from this software, but I strongly suggest that you save yourself the frustration of dealing with the random God of Speech (Dis-)Recognition

------------END UPDATED REVIEW--------------

Rosetta Stone Version 3 is an excellent way to introduce someone to a new language.

SETUP
Reasonably easy, but I would strongly recommend an Internet connection during installation to get all the features unlocked.  I did the installation on an airplane, and found out that I was missing a few things.  This is easily remedied later.

COURSE CONTENT
Overall, the course content is very good, using only the German language--there is no use of English at all, except for menu options and such.  This is not, therefore, a course that relies at all on ""translation"".  Rather, the course uses images and audio to acquaint the user with key words and phrases, then re-enforces them by using them in different orders, combining them in different ways, etc. until the use becomes natural.

This is generally quite effective, but in some areas falls short.  For example, the intricacies of German articles (is it ""Der"", ""Das"", ""Die""?) can be a little tricky to pick up in this way--it would be nice to have at least some explanation of how these are used in a general sense, explaing how they are used with respect to gender and plurality.

An unfortunate feature is that the images appear to be very generic, as opposed to specifically related to the German culture.  I assume that this allows Rosetta to recycle these images for other languages, but it diminishes the quality of the immersion program, and is my reason for giving this product only four stars.  To truly learn a language, one must understand its culture as well, and having images that match that culture would greatly enhance the experience.

CONCLUSION
Other than the specific issues mentioned previously, this is an excellent product and I would recommend it over any other language training products I have encountered."
"This is a truly dreadful product, worthless to all but the most basic tax-filers. One cannot include here any deductions beyond the scheduled standard deductions, no investment returns, not anything, in fact, except standard w-2 earnings reports and tax. Any need beyond that will require that you buy an extra, much more expensive program.

For years, I was a devoted Turbo Tax user. Last year, I switched to H&R Block Business, and the trial of this product confirms the wisdom of that decision.

No more Intuit Turbo Tax for me."
Always a great product!
"Backpacker is an outstanding magazine for those who love to hike and also for those who enjoy paging through a magazine containing lots of enticing photographs of nature scenes. This magazine is, first and foremost, a publication for lovers of the outdoors and the sport of backpacking. But the pictures of mountains, lakes, streams, wildlife, etc., are enticing to anyone. They can quickly convert the non- outdoorsman type into a nature lover.
Besides the great pictures, Backpacker is also excellent for its product testing and for its advice and educational material. Backpacks, mountain bikes, tents, and so forth might seem like simple products, but you would be surprised at how many different varieties and options are available for this type of merchandise. Backpacker describes different items available for sale, complete with web site address and phone# so you can make a purchase, and it often conducts tests to see how the different products stack up. It also offers educational material on the sport of backpacking and general advice on such topics as food, exercise, proper nutrition, first aid, etc.
Backpacker averages between 90 and 120 pages in total length and it's published 9 times per year (three of the issues combine two months into one). It's one of the few special interest magazines I have read that has something to offer most anyone. Even if you don't like hiking, there is still a good chance you will enjoy thumbing through the pages of Backpacker, if nothing else, just to enjoy the great photography.
Overall, this is an outstanding outdoor publication. The articles, the personal stories, the advice, the photos, and the educational material all add up to a perfect magazine for anyone who loves to partake in outdoor activity or who just enjoys looking at the stunning photos. 5+ stars to Backpacker!"
"Good: Easy installation. Start screen is attractive and useful.

Not so bad: The Windows 8 screen is made for a touch screen or a large touchpad. It works fine with a smaller touch pad or mouse, however.

Bad: It keeps switching from Windows 8 Start screen to the Windows 7 Desktop. Why? It's not because you are really in Windows 7, because there is no real or easy control over what is there. And you are no longer on the Windows 8 screen. It needs to be one or the other.

Finding out how to do stuff is a pain, because it seems very disorganized--things are not located where I expect them. Part of this is the Mac-emulation of ""Here, let me do it for you,"" which also means, ""Do it my way.""  There are a number of reasons I don't buy Apple, and this is one of them, so I don't need their nonsense on my Windows machines.

Also bad: It is always on the Internet. It has cute pictures that run continuously, weather, etc., and you have to go to the trouble of turning it off. I spend a lot of time on the Internet. However, when I am working on something else, I don't need my machine spending time with open connections to the Internet. It is hazardous enough when I am actively online. Also, there are times I need the computing power of my machine and I don't want to share it.

My conclusion: I assume Windows 9 will have the Windows 8 interface all the time with no nonsense about switching back and forth between 8 & not-7. I have one computer switched to Win8, but I am going to wait until Win9 comes out to switch the others."
"A lot has been said to denigrate Windows 8.  The ""Metro"" interface doesn't make much sense on a desktop computer without a touchscreen, and the desktop interface that you can switch to doesn't have the all important start button... I think that the person who convince Microsoft to eliminate the ""start button"" was probably an employee planted by Apple.  It was so absolutely stupid to remove the start button that it had to be something like that.

That said, I installed freeware called ""classic start"" that not only gave me the start button back, but also allowed me to configure it so that the system defaults to the desktop configuration when the OS boots.

Aside from the interface, Windows 8 is fast, smooth, flawless... it is a great operating system.  For those purchasing new computers, I recommend you go with Windows 8.  Because Windows 7 is almost as good, stick with that on your older systems.

Microsoft presented us with a very good OS with an interface that doesn't make sense unless you have a touch screen.  Hopefully they'll tweak the interface and return the start button with an update.... are you listening, MIcrosoft?"
"First a little background.  I have always been a Photoshop guy.  I am a pro photographer, and I have taught photoshop in my college photography classes for years.  However, the latest versions aren't really being sold.  Instead you pay a monthly or yearly fee.  No thanks.  I know that's the trend lately, but I don't have to like it.  As a result I am in the process of switching.  The Corel suite is, so far, just as powerful.  By that I mean that I haven't yet wanted to do something and not been able to do it with this software.  There has certainly a learning curve.  Corel uses different terms than Adobe.  What I know as layers are now called objects, to give just one example.  It took me a while to become an expert at Photoshop, and this software will be no different.

As primarily a photographer, Photo-Paint will be the portion of the suite I use most.  It has been easy to adjust so far, and there are hints both at the right side and bottom of the screen.  I already like some things better.  For instance, when cloning, which I use often, in this program you select the area to clone from by simply right clicking it.  I was used to having to press alt, but this way is easier -- no hands on the keyboard.  I have so far found this to be quite easy to figure out on my own or with the on-screen hints.  I have only used Help when I didn't know what to call something because the terminology is different.

The Website Creator is also easy to use and has some good, pre-made templates.  I don't do a lot of websites, but I did a quick one to try it out and it was pretty easy.  In this case I am comparing it to Site Spinner, and this seems to compare well.  Aftershot allows editing of RAW files, and many other functions I have been using Lightroom to do.

The suite comes with a lot of extras, such as 1000 fonts, 10,000 pieces of clipart, templates, frames, fills, and a bunch more, and all can be used royalty free if you are doing commercial work.  The suite works well on my Windows 10 computer, and handles my dual monitor setup well.  I am impressed so far, and it isn't too expensive for a complete suite of graphics tools.  I am making the switch."
"If you have a tablet like the Wacon Bamboo with a capture pen, the amazing speed and quality of the Corel Painter 2015 will make you swear you're working with paper and pencil. What I've noticed especially with this version of the Painter is its Photoshop-like interface with snappy speed. The variety of brushes is too great to include in a review. They are there...everything you can imagine. This is simply the best version of Corel Painter."
"- Downloaded this version of Office for Mac because I upgraded to OS X Yosemite and didn't want to deal with apples version of office apps.
- Price is right, but use the comparison chart on Microsoft website or Amazon to see the differences in this versio"
It is amazing that software this bad could be released.  If Microsoft had more competition--this would have died a quick death in the market place.  Slows your machine down to crawl.  Freezes and crashes.  Reboot if you must (and you will) and nothing improves.  Unstable and unreliable.  Stick with XP.
"same ol' same ol' from Microsoft - but what can you expect from a company that's large, dysfunctional, and has such a history of poorly/slowly responding to their customers.

Want a hobby solving for why (your) computer(s) aren't functioning as expected - get Windows.  Want to instead spend your time 'using' your expensive piece of technology... get a Mac.  PCs are cheaper b/c there is a 'free-market' on the components - meaning there are lots of different components and thus problems with them working together nicely.  It's your time and you have to ask yourself - ""what's it worth to me."" I'd rather not loose the 10's of hours thank-you and instead use that time for something else.

Windows 7, my report to you, from me, a guy who owns PCs and uses them heavily in graphic design and high-end commercial production.  Sincerely.

Windows 7 is:
*slow - example, right click on a desktop item and you'll be waiting several seconds before the menu appears - enough time for you to give up and repeatedly right-click - causing more issues (FYI I use high-end PCs with super fast SSD drives with 8 processors or more, with 16GB RAM or more, on a 64bit OS - and it's still slow)

*buggy - example, Windows 7 still ships with a blatant bug that causes the clock to not tell the correct time... a year after it's release, Windows 7 still is known to ship with this issue - your computer can't tell time correctly.

*stupid and poorly designed - MS tried very hard to copy the designs pioneered by Apple.  The user interface is XP blended with OSX.  Sadly, Microsoft didn't improve on that design; and actually did a rather poor job of copying it.  There are parts of Windows 7 that clearly still XP where you have windows that can't resize to reveal all of their data/messages/paths so you're forced to ""scroll"" or in some cases you simply don't get the ability at all (example: properties page for a folder - ""location"" only displays the first 50 or so characters - the window doesn't resize).  Areas of XP which needed improvement - take for example the XPs infamous ""screen saver"" - have actually been changed and made less-user friendly (the Windows 7 screen saver removes the ability to set the rate to an exact value - like every 3 seconds - at which pictures will rotate - instead it's ""slow"" ""medium"" or ""fast"" and no clue as to what those equal).

I could go on, but I have PC problems and OS issues I'm trying to solve right now - understand?

I'm just so frustrated at this moment I figured I'd let you people know that this Windows 7 will teach you to hate your PC all over again...

I'm here just trying to help."
"Complete computer and internet protection for 3 users for under $25 - I'm sold!  I got tired of all the pop-up ads on free anti-virus programs.  The hassle wasn't worth the few dollars I was saving.

Not only is this internet anti-virus, it has so much more.  I use the 10 GB of online file backup to store my irreplaceables (family photos, insurance documents, contracts, etc).  I have the full system scan to keep my computer running faster and to keep my junk files to the minimum.  I have a Trend Micro securely locked folder with my financial information in it.  The secure delete program is my favorite.  Instead of just emptying my desktop trash (which doesn't really delete anything, it just hides it), I delete all my file with the secure delete feature.  This truly erases them so that they can never be hacked.  Window's can't do that!

Overall I'm very pleased with this software.  It was a breeze to install.  Runs great without any system crashes.  And gives me much more than anti-virus.  I'll be looking to upgrade when the 2013 edition is released."
"A little more advanced that my needs, but simple enough for me to use.  I have used other Corel products for editing photos.  I have started using video more in my marketing via social media.  So this now becomes a handy tool for my professional work.

Corel generally is less frustrating than Microsoft and makes more sense in my non-technical background."
Have been using Turbo Tax for years.  I always do my taxes for myself and family and friends.  I once tried HR Block and did not come close years ago.  Why change company when I have been satisfied year after year.
"This Norton software is set up to work when your laptop is on WiFi. It sounded cool as you can lock down your laptop remotely and show a courtesy message, but as people have pointed out anyone with some knowledge of computers may be able to over ride it, if they reinstall the operating platform.

This software proved mostly useless, as it did not locate my mobile device accurately. For my laptops it was a little fussy to set up, especially on Windows 8. It had trouble locating the laptop even when on WiFi. It can also take pics from the webcam enabled laptop at 10 second intervals but that feature did not work well for me.

The IP address search if the computer is not on WiFi is also very approximate, and wouldn't do any good if the laptop was actually stolen.

Overall, it seems like too much money for just 1 year subscription. As other reviewers have pointed out there are free apps available for this type of stuff which are not as full featured but do the basic job."
"For home-use anti-virus/anti-spyware, I'm looking for three things:

1. Easy to install and easy to use

2. Operates light and doesn't slow down my laptop

3. The software works.

Trend Micro met all three of those expectations, so much so that I bought the full Trend Micro Internet Security Pro package for three users. After years of frustration with McAfee and Norton - software incompatibility and system resources bogged down - I am pleased with the Trend Micro experience.

I've also switched from IE to Firefox, which eliminated the frozen screens and slow Internet surfing. I recommend Trend Micro and Firefox, especially if you spend a lot of playing and shopping on the Internet."
"Right off, prepare to be irritated by the registration process for PagePlus: if you don't register the program by calling a *telephone number!!*, you will be pestered every time you start PagePlus. If you do register, be prepared to spend about 9 minutes speaking to customer service. This is rather incredible that in 2011 you still have to do this.

Apart from this rather annoying start, I have to say that PagePlus is a great piece of software. And complex. Luckily, the opening splash screen offers some help in the form of online video tutorials and also a 256-page User Guide. The quality of these guides are actually clear and pleasing to view, quite educational. The included Quick Start Guide gets you on your way if you're not a manuals reader like me. There is a LOT of very useful information here, if you have the time to go through them.

I was able to very quickly open one of numerous design templates and create a newsletter. The design templates come in a variety of colors and themes so for the newbie, it's incredibly useful--you can quickly create anything from calendars to scrapbooks, business cards, all sorts of fliers and posters.

The newsletter template I was using had two inserts for graphics which when clicked on opened an Import Picture window with a choice to either link or embed the picture. The process could not be easier! The layout is well-thought-out: to the right are the panes for choosing colors, lines, transparencies and schemes in addition to those for creating new pages, picking swatches (in RGB or CMYK format) and even a gallery from which you can choose cartoon icons/symbols and other graphics. The bottom bar holds a storage place for graphics and other media that may end up in your work.

The great thing is the end product which is available as an industry-standard PDF for publishing  or as a graphic. It is also possible to send the project file directly as an email attachment. In addition to all this, the features and tools available are staggering, from a ""LogoStudio"" for designing logos, to a built-in PhotoLab photo editor and even an Image Cutout Studio that enables the user to edit out or in backgrounds and other graphics. Truly outstanding.
I have to confess that I didn't think too highly of this product when I started because of the hassles I had with registration, but with each use, I see even more reason to like PagePlus. I am truly blown away by the feature-set available and all the tools available for creating the numerous types of publications you want.

5 well-deserved stars."
"Installed and bugs as usual are there.  This years goof up is the calculator.  Click the calculator button on the toolbar and NOTHING.  No response.  Also on startup the screens flash weird on my Dell computer.  Apparently some kind of incompatibility with my very common Nvidia video card.  Another Quicken first.  Will add more bugs as I find um.

Note:  I just uninstalled Quicken 2014.  Then I reinstalled it.  During reinstall it downloaded some updated files from Quicken(which it did not do very early this morning).  Now the calculator is working OK!!

Update 1:  The IOS companion application for Quicken DOES NOT work with this version!!!"
love that they can e-mail them to u. so u can use them the same day
"I'm using this software with my Canon Vixia HF10 and it has yet to disappoint me.

The software creates high quality 720p and 1080p video and the editing options are endless.

The biggest draw for me is the ability to transition from one scene to another using transitions and the video not freezing, but still staying in motion.

You have the option of adding video, sound, images, transitions, effects, music, etc. The entire software is easy to navigate and use, but it does use quite a bit of resources so a good, solid PC is necessary to get the job done.

The different formats you can use to create videos are numerous. You can create BluRay videos, DVDs, CDs, YouTube Videos, Vimeo Videos and more.

This is the only software I've been able to find that can handle Canon's MKV files which makes it worth it in that right alone.

I don't think anyone using this software for amateur editing will be disappointed."
Item just as described
"Dove Men + Care Body and Face Bar in Deep clean has a very neutral odor best described as simply soapy with no noticeable perfume except for maybe the slightest hint of sandalwood so it is not so much masculine as definitely not feminine. It cleans quite well but has moisturizers so it doesn't leave the face feeling dry but rather soft and smooth. There are some visible small black ""purifying grains"" in the ivory-colored bar but perhaps also something else that provides a very gentle exfoliation. This bar is ideal for both men and for women who don't like strongly-perfumed soaps."
As always the winzip lines released another product that is amazing. With its simple user interface and great instructions its always easy to unpack those pesky yet necessary zip files.
"If there is one reason why I like this product, it is the simplistic rating that they provide to each and every website even before you visit that website.  Let us say for example that you visit [...] and search for 'LCD HDTV' - google comes back with thousand of results - we all know that some of these sites are genuine and some of them are just spam sites which are there just to introduce virus into our computer and hack information from us.

McAfee does a good job of highlighting each of the google results links with a easy to see marking if that site is safe to visit - this will result in avoiding a lot of bad websites and harm to our computeers.

There are a couple of other good things about McAfee:
  * Comprehensive protection - McAfee protects not just against viruses, but also against Spamware
  * On access scan - This is something which you will hate as well as equally like :  The Antivirus will always keep running in the background and scan each and every website you visit, each and every program you run.  This will slow down things a little bit, but the protection is comprehensive.

  I have noticed that McShield much faster than Symantic in On-Access scanning
  * Easy to share : A 3-user license is very easy to share, you get to create an online account with McAfee with which you can download the latest version of antivirus on any computer and install it"
Love to read the articles and recipes!  Loved to read mom's subscription growing up and now I've given it to my daughters.  Three generations of readers....
Great price. Gift that comes monthly and provides much.
Used it for years. Great anti virus.
"easier than a trip to the store. I buy these and keep them on hand for teacher gifts, etc."
"Okay, long time user, less and less happy last few years.  This year is the final straw.  They chagne all kinds of security settings that caused me hours of grief on things nothing to do with the actual software including installing stuff I don't need and didn't ask for.

So don't know about the others, but take a pass on this forever.

I do IT and can only imagine the hours people have burned AFTER installing this package and not realizing it was the cause of other issues.

Good luck."
"For those that are not quite understanding what this product is: it is a subscription to Office so that you will always have the latest version. You will have to fork out for it every year or be unable to use it. If you're a mover and shaker that needs to be up to date all the time then this might offer a good value for you. Bear in mind that the personal edition only gives you access on 1 PC and 1 tablet. Mobile is additional.

It is a rare household these days that is confined to such limitations. My household contains no less than 4 computers and several tablets at any given time. At a price tag ranging between $50 and $70 per year I can't be enthused about recommending this product. If you absolutely need the latest version of Office every year then I would suggest looking at the Home subscription instead. For myself, we will continue with the non-subscription version and upgrade every 2-3 years if needed."

However, Fastflick will not launch, and I get a message saying that I would need to upgrade my graphics card in order to use Fastflick.

I can use all of the other functions.
Screen Capture has some very good features, it includes sound capture which is great for creating Youtube videos, I was able to capture sound from my mic or my sound card, and had no trouble getting all of the parts of a group conversation collected and sync to a video I was creating.

Movie maker included a good selection of sound effects, and was much better than Windows Movie Maker, with a wide variety of special effects and screen transition types.

Even though I rate myself as a beginner, not having very much experience with this type of program, I found the interface easy to understand and use.

I think this is a good program and I do plan to upgrade my video card in the future as I would like to be able to use all of the features."
"The 2006 Turbo Tax is the best yet.  I have used Turbo Tax for many years now and it improves every year.  I was a Beta Tester this year so I got a ""sneak-peek"" at the latest product and WOW is it great.  Every year it becomes easier and easier to prepare my taxes.  I am not sure why anyone still uses someone else to prepare their taxes or does it the old manual way.  Turbo Tax makes it a very simple process.  It leads you through your return by asking questions.  From your answers, it fills in the tax forms.  In the end, it reviews your return for possible errors, missed deductions and items that might trigger an audit.  Last but not least, you can send your return via the internet or print your return and mail it.  If you do it via internet, you get confirmation that your return has been received and accepted by the IRS. (Ever wondered if it got lost in the mail?)  This is about as painless as tax preparation can get.  Give it a try.  I highly recommend this 2006 Turbo Tax version."

"After using Corel Ulead Video Studio 11.5 for years, I was given the opportunity to give VideoStudio ProX7 a try.

The first thing I noted was how similar the interface is between those two, true they're both Corel, but I would have thought after 6 years it would be quite changed. This is not bad at all, if you like me, have used a similar software in the past, you should have no problems getting used to the new version and its enhancements.

Very easy to install, once running I must say I was impressed with the performance, quite an enhancement once compared to Ulead 11.5, considering the program is working with very heavy HD files.

The interface for editing videos or creating slideshows is unbelievable easy to use, you can even drag and drop and then select your desired object to edit or add effects, text and filters to it. My first project was a video comprised of several short ones of my almost two year old son. I was able to edit, add music, transitions and effects without any problems at all. One thing that happened to me though, is that while editing, the VideoStudioProX7 recognized all video formats I used (even .mov, which was not recognized by the older version) I saved the project and when I opened it the day after, all my .mov videos were unlinked and could not be added, if I tried to, the application would error out indicating an invalid file format. I tried to find answers on the web and was unable to (understandable being this a new version), I exited the application, reopened it and all my videos were there. It was very odd but I thought I'd mention it should it happen to someone else.

As a heavy user of this type of applications (not professionally of course, mostly family videos and the like) I can definitely recommend the ProX7, while very similar to older versions in its front end, there are a great deal of enhancements, templates and new features that make it worth the upgrade."
"Pinnacle, Corel and Adobe all feature excellent video editing software.  Each has it's pro's and cons.  Adobe is the go to for PROFESSIONALS (Premiere Pro + After Effects), especially if you also have a need for photo editing (Photoshop), publishing marketing materials (InDesign), vector graphics (Illustrator), webdesign (Dreamweaver and Muse) and much much much more, then the subscription based software known as Creative Cloud is the way to go.

For those of us who prefer to use software that we own without needing to pay a monthly licensing fee, both Corel and Pinnacle offer great software.  I am very pleased with Pinnacle. Pinnacle has a bit of a learning curve but if you've used Premiere Pro and After Effects or Corel the learning curve is shortened. Studio 18 Ultimate  handles 4K, HD and 3D.

Highly recommend for anyone who's dabbling in video production but not quite ready to take the leap into Adobe's monthly licensing fee."
"This Old House is published, naturally enough, as an adjunct to the popular PBS show, but it doesn't really offer much by itself. It's mostly a read-and-toss sort of magazine. If you're really interested in home building and remodeling, there are two far superior magazines: Fine Homebuilding and Old Home Journal. Each of them offers far more depth and useful information than This Old House, not to mention better photography and a wider range of topics. Fine Homebuilding in particular is a magazine you'll want to keep- and most readers do."
"Love the Quicken 2010 product.  Don't know how I would track my investments or finances without it, and when it comes Tax time it makes calculating captial gains/losses a breeze.

"MS Works 9 looks at first to seem no different than the previous version (8.5). Appearances are very deceiceiving in this case. A customer will be hard-pressed to find a review or list of new features that make version 9 a good buy. I wish to list the good and new features.
1. printed and online ""Getting Started Guide""
2. A new inteface for the online Guide.
3. Ability to use large icons without minimizing half of the original buttons. This allows users with low vision to use large icons and avoid having to presess an extra arrow key
4. Works still has the same look and functionality of 8.5, but the inclusion of letter, fax and mail merge tasks make the suite worth its price.
5. Windows Installer for 9.0 is very easy to use and is sleek, fast  and  easy.

Naturally there are some faults with this version:
1. It is essentially  a ""point releas"" of Works 8.5 and, as such, should be named version 8.6, 8.7 or even 8.1
2. After all these years of buying new versions of the product, Microsoft should have created icons that eiter matched the Vista Aero theme or the sleek look of XP. No such luck. The icons in 9.o are the same as we ha seen for years and it is true that they have more in common with the Windows 2000 theme than with a program that was intended to be a application specifically targeted at Vista users.
3. On the  whole, Works 9.0 has more benefits than it has detractions and I recommend over any Office suite on the market that is intended to be used in the home. I took away one star because the icons were so bland while the task launcher wasstunning in appearance."
Don't buy it here. It will not keep or include your activation code in your digital locker.
"About 10 years ago, I bought my first copy of Photoshop. Or, rather...  I bought a copy for the company I worked for. I thoroughly enjoyed learning all the things I could do to a photo with that program. I'll admit that I wasted quite a few hours of my work days playing around with it and modifying some of my own family photos. Since I left that company about seven years ago, I have been without that program and the fun that it brought me. Now, I finally have a copy of it to play with, again!

This new version of Photoshop has quite a few differences from the version I had all those years ago, but it didn't take too long to pick up on most of its features. The program is very user-friendly, and it is so widely used that it isn't hard to find tutorials out on the web that describe what you would be looking to do with it. Though the novelty of the program isn't what it was the first time around, I am still having a lot of fun tinkering with and improving upon some of the family photos I have taken over the past few years.

The price is quite affordable, too. I have noticed that some of the things I could do in my last edition of Photoshop are absent from this version, though it seems more features are downloadable for a fee. This is something you need to be aware of if you plan on really doing artsy things with this program. Though the initial cost is low, you might end up paying a bit more for some of those ""premium"" tools.

Overall I am quite happy with this product at this price. I just wish I had more time to play with it than I do! I would highly recommend this product to anyone who takes their photography hobby seriously."
"WordPerfect Office X7 Standard is a solid app suite and compares favorably to Microsoft Office Professional. I've been using WP for about a month and I've been able to do everything that I do with MS Office Pro. The fact that WP's files are compatible with MS Office is a great feature.

If I were someone who had to use MS Office at work, I'd buy MS Office for home, too. That way I'd always be learning the ins and outs of one app instead of two. If I could use any business suite all the time, though, I'd select WP. It's robust and -- importantly -- less expensive than MS Office Pro.

One downside for WP: Because MS Office is so popular, there are more educational books, sites, forums and videos out there for learning that app than there are for WP Office. That might be a deal-breaker for some.

Overall, WP Office is a great office suite and it's too bad that so many people are tied to MS Office."
"I recently re-installed this onto a home theater PC (HTPC) I built.  Previously I had written a largely negative review, but I'm putting in a new one now with some details about using this for HTPC.

1. DRM.  Using NetFlix with a TV means you have to have a direct HDCP-enabled connection from the computer to the TV if you're using HDMI to connect to the TV.  Putting a receiver in the middle of the mix breaks the HDCP stream and ""protected"" streams don't play.  You get a mysterious unhelpful ""DRM error"" instead of something useful.

2. When using this as a HTPC, I had to turn off ""super fetch"" and indexing and defragmenting.  Why does Windows defrag automatically?  There's really no reason to do this these days and it can result in data loss if disk blocks are moved over deleted files (i.e., you can no longer recover deleted files).

3. Software updates are just as annoying as they were with XP.  Come back to your computer to use it and find that it's been rebooted.  As a HTPC, this isn't a big deal--as a workstation it's a huge issue to me.  I just leave the updates on because of how I'm using the computer, but as a workstation I'd turn it off.

4. The Aero interface is pretty to look at.  Modern hardware as of late 2008 can handle it just fine.  I'm using a $140 motherboard w/ integrated ATI graphics and a $70 Pentium dual-core processor and everything is slick and fast.  Hardware has caught up with Vista.

So in summary, it's just another version of Windows.  It's prettier than XP, and if you turn off enough of the background stuff, it's more than usable with 2 GB of RAM without constantly accessing the hard drive."
"Ive used McAfee for years.  Only once. . . several years ago. . . have I had an issue with it not catching something.  Granted, that was a HUGE hassle when it happened, but since then, I haven't had any issues, and I still use it.

If you look at the information above in the listing, you will see the comparison between this option and the Total Protection option.  They are very similar, though Total Protection gives you encryption, if thats something you need or are interested in.  Currently, they are the same price if you go the key code route.

"No CD, Only and Activation Code, Easy to Install.  Email other devices you want to put it on.  Sounds idea, right?

Norton is Norton is Norton.  Pop-ups.  Obtrusive.  Bossy.  Ugh.

HOWEVER...FIVE devices for all this ""fun.""  And you can put it on your phone/tablet.  OK...so I'll have to figure out how to get rid of the irritating pop-ups, huh?

I also like that it guarantees to remove all of the viruses or your money back. I feel comfortable that my devices are protected.

That, my friend, is good!"
"I've subscribed to this magazine for several years, and I admire Rachels' perkiness and I do enjoy some of the articles. The problem I have is none of the recipes really appeal to me. Either they are strange, example: ""Elvis Styled Grilled Banana Sundaes"" or just not appealing  ""Salami, White Bean and Water Cress Crostini."" She focuses a lot on pasta dishes, dishes with tomato, appetizers which are fine, but not tempting, and I don't find they have as much family appeal.  The non-holiday months are fairly generic, although I admit I do like the Fall and December issues.

There are also articles that focus on clothing, travel and the psychology of shopping.
I would suggest buying a few issues and seeing if her style and tastes are yours."
"This is by far the worst edition of windows I have ever used. Every computer both PC or latop that I tried running this beast on died fairly quickly due to constant crashing and driver issues.  I had Constant crashes, bugs, security issues and noticed it was vastly slower than XP due to how bloated this broken OS is.  Terrible."
"We do allot of advertising and surfing to promote some of the new features of our websites from time to time. But every now and then we come across a few websites that try to upload some malicious software to our computers. (Some webmasters are just scandalous!) So we're always on the look out for some extra protection against these type of threats. We've been there, done that... and we don't want a return.

If you use any type of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Traffic-Exchange/dp/1430315768/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Traffic Exchange</a>, both manual and auto surf programs, you know exactly what we're talking about. You'll find that this program works like a charm and is a great addition to your security arsenal. However, you will need to babysit your computer, because this program will go off like a high school fire alarm and nail just about every other website on most of those traffic exchanges.

On most of our computers, We usually rely on IE 7's Malicous Site security feature,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Webroot-s-Spyware-Sweeper/dp/B0016PV4NA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Webroot's Spyware Sweeper</a>, in addition to our anti-virus program, which hasn't let us down... yet! (I know, I know... we're a little outdated. But as the old adage goes, ""...if it ain't broke, don't fix it!"") But I know that sometimes they are just not enough.

With all of that said, I do like this program, so far. It was very easy to upload and didn't have any conflicts with any of our other programs, epecially with the use of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/XP-Pro-with-SP3/dp/B0018RCAD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">XP Pro with SP3</a>. It didn't hog up to much of our resources. We did choose to dump the previous version of Kaspersky Internet Security 2010 before uploading this anti-virus program, just in case there was a conflict. (We've been there before too!)

I do recommend that you turn off your&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/External-Hard-Drives/dp/B000VZCEUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">External Hard Drives</a>&nbsp;when uploading the program, as it does have a tendency to write the program to them, as well.

Overall, very satisfied with the program and it's compatability."
Great convenience for someone who needs to order from home and cannot drive.
"Full disclosure: I'm a Mac user so I don't use software like this.  Never have.  But I have a girlfriend with a Windows PC and she always has virus problems.  Kids downloading junk, that sort of thing.  She tried Norton and it just didn't work.  I gave her this to use and it did the job.  I can't tell you why, I just know that it made her computer faster and did a better job than a leading competitor."
"This is my favorite 'family' magazine of all times.  Infor and articles on houses, cleaning, recipes, family activities, family health, organizing, different towns/cities, vacation ideas, etc.  It is always fresh, family appropriate, with lots of find more info links too if something catches your interest.

The best all around family magazine in my opinion!"

"I've been a user of Norton/Symantec products since Peter Norton had his picture on the box. Never had a problem with the products I used. At first Norton Anti virus and Norton Utilities then switched to NIS only. I've never tried Norton 360 and I'll let braver souls than I figure out why not.( cough-cough)
Remember, No program is going to make you 100% secure. But Norton at least makes you THINK you are and that is what really matters.. As long as you see that little green circle with the white check mark in it on your task bar I wouldn't worry much. But a word of caution, there are places where you can find trouble if you look for it. Nothing can prevent everything. So be careful where you surf and watch out because the really weird stuff happens when you look at seemingly harmless sites. Some song Lyric look  up sites come to mind.off hand. Use caution and Norton NIS will serve you very well.
One of the benefits of old age is that you don't have avoid temptation, it avoids you. It's  a great product, buy it you'll like it."
excellent quality and fast shipping
Excellent
worked but not buy it again because the newer product is beter.
Perfect gift for a teenage grandson and the tin is a great way to hold it. Cute detail and colors.
Awsome
"Works fine, but if your using 2011, I don't think it's worth upgrading."
"As with others, I have used the Delux version for years without issue until this year.  I was irritated, to say the least, with having to upgrade for something as stupid as ""well, we want it to match the online versions we sell""!  What idiot takes away features?

Since i have been using this product for years, I did not want to have to change all of my data to a new system so I bought the ""enhanced"" product!  What a crock.  This version hounds you constantly to upgrade!!!!  Add to that the fact you cannot buy it without ""State Tax Forms""  (We do not have an income tax in our state, why am I paying for this?) and they really did find a way to make things bad.

To add insult to injury, now Turbo Tax says they will refund the difference you had to pay for the version change.  The Catch?  You have to give them your SOCIAL SECURITY number!!!!  Why?  so they can get your last years tax return!!!  What do they need with my Tax Return??????  They have no business knowing what my taxes are!  Why should i trust them with that information?  So, here they go turning a bad situation into an absolute nightmare!!

I absoluetly will NOT use this product again after this year.  If I have to, I will go back to filing a paper form before i will ever buy from this company again!!!

I give it two stars because the software does work."
I love this magazine and pick up lots of tips from every issue for maintaining our 8 acre piece of property.  It is full of simple advice and offers a lot of information on animal husbandry and gardening.  Every issue is a joy to read and I can't imagine not having a subscription.
"works fine, full license, includes outlook, the physical keycard is $30 less, you just have to wait two days to get it."

"I know there are fans of this software, and it's a good buy, but I prefer Photoshop Elements (Adobe) and can't get into the PS Pro interface. It's ok but I find it slower and clunkier than Photoshop Elements. I suppose it's what you are used to, that is, a matter of taste. However, it will do the job of editing photos. Meh."
"I really like this soap, but I have to say that Shea Butter scent dominates and mutes the sandalwood scent. I love a strong, earthy sandalwood, but this is not that. It is more of a soapy perfume with a hint of sandalwood. That aside, the large bar lathers up richly and when it is finally rinsed off, it leaves me feeling refreshed and clean. It doesn't irritate my skin, but like other Pre de Provence soaps, it cleans so well that it can leave it feeling a little dry. I would definitely get it again, but just wish it smelled more strongly of sandalwood.

"excellent cream, great shipping."
"Been using it for a few months on computers only and working well as far as I know. This purchase was to renew my license 10 months from now. You have to wait until the day your old license expires to add the new one, or you lose the remaining days on your old license. My only complaint is that there isn't any import and export feature of settings, so I had to configure many settings manually on four different computers. Attached are screen captures of my settings which will maybe assist you. My preference is anti-spam OFF, and a minimum of disruptions and warnings from the security software. If your C drive is an SSD like mine then you want Optimization also OFF."
Great product would buy from seller agian
Decent
Decent delivery speed and everyone loves panera

"All is fine no problem to report, will definitely recommend them to my friends."
"I have nicknamed this software Bugmaster.  It lightened my wallet by $100 at Circuit City.  I needed a program to edit a DVD home movie on a crash basis.  I wasted an entire evening trying to get the software to work.  It does not work.  I tried it on two different late-model computers.  No dice.  I had owned a Roxio product 5 or 6 years ago, so I tried logging onto their website to see if there was a bug fix, but because I could not remember the ancient password, no luck there either, and although they said they had emailed me a new password, they had not.

Fact is, I am tired of software vendors that do this--they package a bug-ridden and downright inoperable software program hoping to sucker users into buying it, with the intention of putting their users through some god-awful time consuming patching process.  They have to know that their software does not work.

Avoid this product.  I would not want it even if it were free.  My time is not free."
"Bitdefender offers solid virus protection, and realtime scanning capabilities.  But there are known slowdown issues and compatibility problems with youtube."
I received a 30 day trial of this software from Microsoft.  I used it to update my website that is hosted by Yahoo.  I had to load the FrontPage extensions to the server then convert my current pages to FrontPage.  This made me go through the process of reformatting nearly everything.  The simple on-line tools that yahoo provides did a better job and quicker than this software.  I suppose if you really are an office expert and want the look and feel of the office interface then you might like it.  Otherwise I think you can do better elsewhere.  This software takes the cookie cutter approach to building a web presence.  Microsoft was offering a 30 day CD trial but have stopped that.  I wonder why they don't want you to try it out any more before you buy it?  Why indeed!
"GLO Premium is a fantastic piece of software for everyone from the casual bible studyist to dedicated students, and can also be a valuable resource for teachers and preachers. The program is stable, well thought out, easy to navigate and is packed full of features, making it an incredible value. GLO Premium installed quickly and easily on my homebrew Vista x64 Intel Core i7 system, full install taking less than 15 minutes from start to finish, using all 3 discs provided. GLO has proven to provide a new way to study the bible in the digital age, giving a streamlined and efficient approach to learning and exploring the bible that would take hours longer manually cross-referencing multiple material via reference books. Highly recommended!"
I have been using titanium since it came out and have been very satisfied. The latest version is no exception. It runs well in the background and has stopped all threats. Also bundled in the package was titanium for android devices. So for one low price I protected three computers and android devices. What a great value. As usual Amazon is a great place to shop. I have always had fast shipping and no problems.
"I have installed the Win Cleaner program on both XP and Vista.  When I tried to update them I was informed that I had used up my updates and that I should purchase another update.  Also, I was advised that if this was not actually true I could file for a ""ticket"" to fix the problem.  I went to the ""WinCleaner"" website, left a message, and wrote down the Ticket Number they assigned.

Then I did the One Click thing on the original program. It did improve the boot time.  So, without the update, I reduced boot time from five minutes to four minutes.  This is some improvement. Wow, 20% faster boot  time.  But it still would not update.  I used email aqain to voice my complaint.

The next day I received an email from ""WinCleaner"" with a hyperlink to download a new program.  I did this and rebooted my machine.  Then I ran the One Click program again.  Then, after installing the download on my three computers, it seemed to run as advertised.

###-UPDATE-###

10/22/10

Okay, so I finally got the kinks worked out in July of 2009. But I was not quite satisfied.  I decided to install ""DriveScrubber 3.""  It removed much more  after running ""WinCleaner.""  Using the two programs together I felt reasonably well covered.

Then I made the mistake of running the program past the expiration date.  Rather than simply being cut off from further use until I renewed, it failed to notify me and instead destroyed my Registry.  Of course, ""WinCleaner"" no longer runs properly.  Now, each time I boot up my computer, I have to stop several programs that are all trying to run at the same time.  Of course, I could maybe fix this problem by simply buying another year of ""WinClearner"" use.  But I think I'll download that free program ""Windows Registry Repair"" before I decide.  With ""DriveScrubber 3"" and the free ""Windows Registry Repair,"" I should be well enough covered.  Maybe I can get off this treadmill.  All this is sure a lot of time consuming trouble!"
no idea what it is
I really like this software.  It's very easy to use and very fast.  I recognize the need for keeping your hard drive clean for more efficient use and in the past have used several producst to do this.  WinCleaner allows me to do all that with just one product.  After you install it you can configure it to do what you want it to do.  From that point forward you just have to remember to click one button to run the software.  Works beautifully and keeps my 4 year hard drive running smoothly.
"After having used TurboTax Deluxe (or their Deluxe equivalent) for 24 years, I made the switch to H&R Block this year after Intuit removed critical functionality from TT Deluxe. I found that H&R Block's software worked as advertised: it downloaded and installed, imported data from last year's TT return, and imported from brokerage accounts--all without any problems. I read the interview process questions pretty closely and found them to be much like those in TurboTax. So, overall the process went quite smoothly, although I haven't yet filed.

My only reasons for not giving 5 stars are 1) the interview questions were just slightly less informative than those of previous years' TT Deluxe (even understanding that ""deluxe"" typically means ""not much hand-holding"" in tax software marketing lingo) and 2) the provided reports were less complete than those of TT Deluxe. For example, I was unable to find effective tax rate paid in any report, nor did I find several years of historical tax data. Perhaps I haven't located all of the reports yet, but that is my impression.

All in all, H&R Block's software worked quite well, and I'm fine with having parted company with TurboTax."
"I purchased Toast 12 Titanium for my Mac running Yosemite hoping to get good video editing and DVD burning software.  I've been disappointed.  The basic video editing software is usable, but provides only the most basic video editing. It its defense, the program is primarily a DVD burning package, not video editor.  The DVD creation piece, is also very basic.  Limited to provided templates with some basic editing.  Sufficient, but does not allow for much customization other than changing the default titles and background picture.  The screen capture software is totally unusable. It has locked up my Mac every time I've tried to use it requiring a hard restart, can't even quit the screen capture program with the OPT-CMD-ESC keys that normally allow forcing quit.  Have never captured a single frame with the screen capture program.  If all you want to do is burn basic DVDs, then this will work for you.  If you expect to capture screens, edit them and then burn to DVD, look for something else."
"I have eczema that can be severe at times, during a breakout. My doctor recommended Aquaphor Healing Ointment, and he did me quite a favor. This cuts the outbreak time in half. My feet get it the worst.

I used to use Neosporin to heal any splits and cracks I've had on my feet and hands. Aquaphor  works better than Neosporin at a fraction of the price. The ointment feels very soothing and not greasy at all. I mistakenly thought that since it looks like Vaseline, that it would be similar in feel, but it's not at all. Aquaphor is much better. It's a wonderful product."
"I don't believe in conspiracy theories, but I am convinced that RSUs (or Restricted Stock Units) are a secret conspiracy between accountants and the US government.  RSUs replaced stock options at most companies in about 2008.

The interface in Turbo Tax requires you to accumulate at least three different documents, the monthly statement from your broker, your 1099-B, and the End of Year Statement from your employer.  Turbo Tax proceeds to ask you questions that aren't on any of those documents.

[insert primal scream here]

I almost gave up and went to H&R Block, but instead turned off the Guided Tour in Turbo Tax and entered the information manually."
Family Circle has a good variety of articles and the price was a big plus!
"It works and does a good job of helping you keep your computer clean and running well. IF, you understand how to use it properly. I love how it finds junk left in the registry by old no longer installed software. Now, for people talking about AVG asking for too much personal information, I agree if that's what's happening. I hate that and have opted to return or not buy software that does that. BUT I have never had that experience with any of AVG's software. it might be because I only install boxed versions and don't bother with trial versions. I really don't know but I have never had them sticking their nose into more than is basically necessary to know. Name, email, and software's license number is all I have ever seen. However, I don't doubt the folks who say extreme nosiness happens to them. My belief is if you switch to paid version via the trial version or renew online, this will happen. I never do either because my experience has shown me going that route is more trouble than it's worth.

If you take the time to learn to use it, it's a wonderful tool for optimizing your computer's functions."
"We decided to update the Win O/S bootcamped on my wife's Macbook Air, as the Win 7 install had been corrupted during an automated update.  What a huge mistake to jump to Widows 8.1 !!!  The O/S no longer played well with the Air.  Support of OpenOffice was ... corrupting files.  We pulled the plug of 8, and installed 7 ... and what an improvement in our experience.  Were it not for business apps my wife has need of running, Windows would begone."
"TT Business still needs to be able to import transactions from a Broker for investment sales.  Almost every Trust has investments so why isn't this a feature in this product.  It is there for Premier and Deluxe.

Overall less buggy than last year.  I use both TT Premier for personal taxes and TT Business Form (1041) for two Trusts"
"Time has its moments of greatness. However, sucked in by the same disease which created the tabloids, Time is often too -- timely.

Time is not the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-New-Yorker/dp/B001U5SPJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The New Yorker</a>. It doesn't seem to have the same political leanings (a plus!), but Time also misses their sharp wit and analysis.

Some of the religious articles have been impressively well-researched, and edited to limit editorial bias.

Want to get a quick look at the world? Read Time. If you are looking to have more than a superficial view, purchase another magazine.

I recommend Time Magazine, but not as a primary news source.

"I found this gift to be thoughtful and smart. Since I am already an Amazon shopper, the card came in handy."
"Gave it 5 stars because I've not found a reason to give it less.  I've used McAfee for years.  I especially like the Quick Clean feature that cleans up my computer's unnecessary temporary files along with clearing the cache and history and other things that take up space and can slow down a computer.

I was hesitant this time when I bought it though, because it was for a download with a subscription code card number.  I've always used a CD for the install in prior years.  When I recently bought a new laptop, I separately bought an external disc drive since my laptop doesn't contain one.  Who knew that things I used to install via a CD are pretty much now only offered as downloads, online.  This is one of those things.  I was nervous trying a new way to install my McAfee Internet Security but I worried needlessly.  It was quite easy and I didn't run into any problems whatsoever.  The product works as it should and like I expected it to.

I do want to mention that I think some people said if you already have a subscription to McAfee, when you install a new version, it extends your subscription for another year from the end date of your old subscription.  I didn't find that to be true.  My previous subscription, that came with my new laptop, was due to run out on (not sure of the date now), let's say, 3/26.  I installed the new subscription on 3/24/2014.  It didn't extend my subscription to 3/26/2015.  Instead, it subscribed me from the date of installation, 3/24 for one year, to 3/24/2015.  So, if you still have a week or two left on your current subscription, I would advise not installing the new one before then.  It's not the worst thing in the world but, it appears you will then lose that week or two that were still remaining on your old subscription.

I do not find that my computer slows down at all on my new laptop.  On my much older PC that runs Vista, there is a noticeable slow down when McAfee is scanning of updating while I'm using the computer.  But, that computer is slow even when nothing is happening to interfere with its performance so I guess Anything that's running in the background would make it operate even slower.  On my laptop that runs Windows 8.1, I find no problem whatsoever.  I've been warned, over the years, not to open certain links or websites and because of McAfee, I've never had a virus, thank goodness."
This offers good computer protection without slowing your computer down too much. I have it installed on two work computers and run regular updates. It keeps my computer clean and running smooth. Recommended.
They do work.. it's awesome
not real helpful.
"(3.5 STARS) I got this software for basic book keeping and it does that and a whole lot more.  This version includes the most options and allows for three users which was a primary concern for me.  Let me start by admitting that I do not have a background in accounting so the software was not as intuitive as I would have liked and I'm not using it for a small company but for a 40+ committee.  The options were amazing and it offered professional grade invoices and financial statements.  It can be set up to manage direct deposits, print checks and a whole host of small business needs (payroll, inventory, audits, etc.) that I do not require at this point.  This software is overkill for my purposes but would work well for a small to mid sized businesses.  I subtracted a star for the difficulty in installing the software and that some features require subscriptions (read payment) to provide complete function."
"I am very pleased with Windows 10 pro, works perfectly"
"While I can review a computer game after ""beating it"" - often a week or two after purchase - with Norton 360 I waited several months after installing it to come to any judgement. There is always a learning curve with any serious software product where you tweak the settings, learn what combination works well for you, and so on. I really feel a serious package like this should be tested out for many weeks - not days - before a decision is made about it.

I run Norton 360 on my main home PC, from which I run several websites. This means I am running database development software, graphic editing software, video editing software, logging software and much more on this machine. Plus I'm a game reviewer, so I'm running some pretty intensive games on it as well. My machine does a great variety of things. You would think if an issue was going to trigger, that I'd probably trigger it.

I definitely agree that you need to spend a little time setting up the software to work well with your surfing and net patterns. Someone who does a lot of networking operations might need ports more open than someone who just reads email and wants their computer locked up tightly. Now, that being said, the interface is rather straightforward to do this. Once you set it up, you're all set.

I haven't run into any issues with Norton 360 once it was set up well. Yes I had to do some tweaking to get my various POP mail accounts working - many of which are customized and using non-standard ports. It was a one time operation, and has been set since then.

In terms of the quality of the anti-virus software, I always give Norton very high marks. Our cable company provided free anti-virus software as part of our cable bill. Virusses got right through their ""shield"". When I put on Norton, Norton instantly spotted those virusses and eliminated them without any fuss.

I completely agree that some systems out there might have issues with this software package, just like some people are deathly allergic to peanuts. Where an XBox 360 is a perfect clone of every other XBox 360 out there, every PC is unique. Every person has different internet settings, different mail software, and perhaps most importantly, different virusses and spyware that have snuck on your system. Undoubtedly there is always going to be some unique blend of these things that causes a system to crash - with OR without Norton 360. In general, though, I really feel Norton 360 should work extremely well on most systems.

Well recommended - but as always, back up your system before beginning, and have your network documentation handy so you know which specific ports you happen to be personally using, to keep those open."
nice look like very good
I wasn't a fan of the ribbon when MS first introduced that.  I think they've fixed some of the things that still bothered me with this version.  If I could just get them to upgrade to this at work I'd be set!!
"Smells incredible...almost a musk, deep scent. Lathers very well. You feel clean all day!"
"The teens love the magazine in our home. I found it here at $5.00 a year special. I got each kid a there own copy. The initial delivery was as estimated and its reliable each month. I check out monthly specials for magazines in our home. I also renew when the magazine goes on special again. It just adds to the length of subscription. Also subscription are easy to managed right here on amazon. I've changed addresses a couple of times since the magazines have started. With no problems.

Warning to parents there is a section in the back called Cosmo exclusive in each month. The article does haves sexual content. Usually last 5 pages or so."
Works perfect for catching potential problems that my antivirus seems to miss.
Love these shoes. My feet have been weird since I was pregnant and my old shoes were uncomfortable. These are very comfy and help me get active. They are also stylish and go with anything.
Great gift for the stylish preteen
"I've been using Paint Shop Pro since version 7. When Corel first bought it from it's shareware creators, they began to dumb it down and it really lost a great deal of its following. Fortunately, they left most of the power under the hood and those features that had been dumbed out of the menus, were still accessible for power users.

I've since upgraded to PSPX and PSP 14, so I am very familiar with the program. Lets start with the inevitable comparison to photoshop. Paint Shop Pro can do,  and has been able to do, 95%+ of what Photoshop as been able to do all along... Layers, yep had them forever, curves, yep... Color enhancement, easy one fixes and removing objects, they are all there. White balance correction, yep - in several places actually. It can read raw files from most major camera makers and will save to any format you can imagine. It can remove objects, repair old photos, make new photos look old, add frames, upload to Flickr, facebook, photobucket, etc... It really does it al.

Paint Shop Pro is powerful enough for anyone, even the snide, presumptuous photo editors that would have you believe that if your photo editing package didn't cost $500 then it isn't worth looking at... Pure elitist hogwash.

ANYTHING that you want to do with a photo can be done with this program.

So why isn't it more widely accepted?

Well, the industry likes a standard and photoshop was the standard back when PSP was still a $79 shareware program. So Photoshop became the standard. And once you learn the way a program works, you don't want to have to relearn the way another program works. Often it is as simple as which key combinations you have to press. Once you have mastered one program, you don't want to have to go back and relearn how to accomplish the same thing in another program.

There is one other big difference. Photoshop has always been far ahead of Paint Shop Pro in standardizing what colors you see on a photo no matter what monitor or computer you are using to view the photo. PSP only recently started trying to make this a priority.

For someone sending their work to LIFE magazine, this is important. For someone sending photos to Walgreens.com or making a shutterfly book for family and friends, it is not. All of the photo printers have software that corrects that sort of thing.

In the end it is fairly simple. If you need photoshop, get it. You will KNOW if you NEED it. If you aren't sure, then you don't need Photoshop. If you think you need PhotoShop, you probably DON'T need it. If $500 is chump change to you, then go ahead and get photoshop. If you make a living sending photos to major publications, get photoshop.

On the other hand, if $500 is a lot of money to you, get Paint Shop Pro. It is a super powerful photo editing program that has the power of photoshop under the hood, but with the ease of use that you would expect from a much less powerful program. You truly get the best of both worlds with Paint Shop Pro!

Low price, ease of use and many automated picture fixing options, yet you also have the power of layers, curves and white balancing no so much more if you are willing to learn how to use them. This is truly a bargain priced program that does virtually everything PS does (and some things it does better) at a fraction of the cost."
"Fekkai Full Blown Aerosol Foam Conditioner is unlike any conditioner I've used in the past. It's a thick foam that can be easily worked through your hair. Leave in for a few moments then rinse out. It did wonders for my thin hair giving it more body and a bit more volume. Anything that keeps my hair from looking limp and almost plastered to my head is a real winner for me. This product went beyond the basic fullness I was hoping for.

So I give this product two thumbs up for improving the look of my fine, limp, sorry hair! I look and the mirror and ask, ""Who's sorry now? Not my hair!"""
Very nice!  I use them every year.
"A little background on me:
I am a long time Quicken user (since the early '90s).  I do both my personal and my wife's business finances on Quicken and though I've never been a big fan of Quicken, but it has always been the best product of its kind that's available in my opinion (that often isn't saying a lot). I run Quicken on a Macbook 13""with 4 gig in Windows XP via Parallels.

I upgraded from Quicken 2008 to 2011 because Quicken notified me that they were no longer supporting 2008 (!).  I have typically never upgraded Quicken unless I was two or more versions behind because most versions were incremental upgrades at best.  I also switched from the ""deluxe"" edition to the ""Home and business"" edition this time around to take advantage of the business reporting features.

On to the review.

Pros:
- The interface is mostly unchanged.  Tweaked a little, yeah, but essentially unchanged.
  -- One step updating, the register, account list, etc. still look much the same and function as they always did. As with any upgrade, finding the features you want can sometimes be a challenge because of some re-organization to the program.

- The interface is fairly easy for a long time user like me to navigate since conventions remain the same.  First time users may have a little learning curve to deal with.

- It is stable and fairly speedy in Windows XP.

- It is still the best of what is available for what I need.

Cons:
- Setting up and editing custom categories is still a pain.  You can't cut & paste or copy & paste when editing categories so EVERYTHING has to be typed in.  I have a large number of subcategories that are very similar to keep track of transactions with a large number of vendors.  With no copy & paste I have to repeat the set up for each one.

- You can't recategorize multiple sub-categories at once.  You have to go into each and every one and make the change individually.

- Documentation is sparse.  if you need help using a specific function, good luck.  The help file isn't very helpful beyond basic (and I mean VERY basic) functionality.  I guess you could call the help line, but my prior experience with Quicken is that they outsourse the help desk to foreign countries, the technicians do not speak English as a first language and they read from a script leading you through the same not so helpful help file you just gave up on.  Things may have changed, but I gave up on them years ago because the experience was so painful.  It was bad enough they just read the help file to me, but their having a poor command of English made it difficult to follow them as well.  I guess Intuit went with the lowest bidder.

- Quicken still loads junkware when loading the program.  This junkware is nothing more than ads for other Intuit products.  Fortunately, all you have to do is send these items to the recycle bin to be rid of them.  Still, it is annoying to have to do this.

Summary:
If you have Quicken 2009 or 2010 I wouldn't bother upgrading unless you have to as I did.  It is still the same old Quicken in a freshened up interface with a couple new bells and whistles.  They have yet to make it truly user friendly, but they do a better job at this than other financial software packages from what I have seen.  For me buying Quicken 2011 was like going to a brand new McDonalds.  Yeah, it is new and shiny and clean, but the menu is still the same.  But then again, sometimes the best surprise is no surprise.

By the way, I purchased this through our local PBS station website so a portion of the purchase amount gets donated to my favorite radio station at no additional cost to me. Thanks Amazon for supporting Public Radio!"
"I've been using for years and still staying with it BUT I want to make any users who work in one state and live in a different one that you will need to buy a second state module from H&R Block. This will cost you an additional $34.95 PLUS TAX. There is NO DISCOUNT. Turbo tax charges the same. They have been increasing the price for the second state module each year and it now costs the same (or more - since it is not discounted) than the Federal + State software.
Just be prepared.

I hope you found this comment both informative and helpful.

"Been using this software for a few weeks and I must say I'm very impressed.  I'm working with a small custom bike business and this software has a lot of features that I haven't used yet but it pretty much does everything.  I like how it keeps track of inventory, can depreciate our tools and other capital assets, and pretty much handle all my accounting needs.

I have been using some other 2014 Sage software for a few months now so I'm already familiar with the interface but it isn't hard to use and their customer support is top notch.  I highly recommend this if you have a small business and need some professional software."
"While the software found about ten fixes that I needed, I noticed that my computer did run slower with this software installed. I still had McAfee for the anti-virus and that could contribute to the slow time, but since my laptop is only a few months old, I definitely noticed a slower running and downloading time. It was simple and quick to install, taking less than fifteen minutes. It is recommended that you clear and delete all anti virus software first and load theirs instead of breaking up the features."
"If you are still using Office 2007 or older then this is a upgrade to consider but there are a few issues with this version of office. The installer seems to run in silent mode so you may find yourself trying to run the installer more than once.  Also, when applications start up they are SUPER SLOW.  Probably because they are connecting to the web.  Bit it can be annoying.

There are a lot of usability tweaks that make this much easier.  A lot of the bigger software company's including Microsoft are moving to a Monthly/Yearly subscription licensing model.  So this may be the last version of Office you can buy outright.  Other than being able to edit PDF files, there aren't a lot of compelling reasons to upgrade from Office 2010. If you are considering buying this for your kids to use for school I think it's a decent investment because they will probably use this software once they get to College and the workforce.

"""Pinnacle Studio 18 Plus"", from Corel Corp., downloaded to my 64bit PC without incident. The program started up quickly and has an intuitive, and familiar, appearance; hovering over most button choices causes an explanatory pop-up. The ""Help"" menu  provides a downloadable 'User Manual' and 'Sample Movie' in addition to links for updates, forums, and support. For the purpose of this review I emailed for support and was surprised at the very quick, and helpful, response.

Although very familiar with a variety of sophisticated photography programs I'm a novice at video creation and 'Pinnacle Studio 18 Plus' is the only program I've had the opportunity to try. I found the 'User Manual' explicit, easy to read and understand, and enormously helpful. There's also an included 45 day access pass to Pinnacle's 'Studio Backlot' where you'll find a host of tutorials. And there are also tutorials available on 'YouTube'.

I've found this program easy to use as it employs familiar actions like drag and drop, but, it also has a learning curve that requires a bit of time and practice to acquire proficiency. After using Pinnacle Studio 18 Plus, off and on, for a few weeks I'm no where near the professional I'd like to be. However, I am confident I'll get there."
"If you are like many of us, we all owned a giant camcorder ""back in the day"" and have a collection of memories collecting dust in a box.  I actually had to go out and buy a player just to save the memories before they were gone!

  I own and love the Honestech VHS to DVD  5.0 and was anxious to try the upgraded 8.0 version.  They are similar, easy to use and it comes with everything you need to transfer your precious memories to DVD and share them with the family!  You can connect your camcorder or VHS player to the box and then your laptop or computer.  The interface is easy to use and I had no problems using it on a new laptop with Windows 7.

  I am working hard on the drop and drag editing!  Honestly, I recorded every moment of Disneyworld, Christmas morning, birthday's etc. I want to make some fun dvd's with a collection of memories. I find the process a bit cumbersome.  What is so hard about drop and drag?  So far, I haven't perfected what I want to do, but it's pretty evident that it is ""just me"" and not the product.  I have been able to shorten clips and make snippets, but haven't been able to put it all together just yet.

  A great product and it certainly beats spending hundreds to have someone do the work for me!"
"This is a nice sea sponge; it really does feel good against the skin and it holds shower gel nicely. It's a good size, too -- I have large hands it's a little bigger than the size of my palm, which makes it easy to hold. I'd give this five stars if it were just a bit less expensive. It's not over-priced (this is a natural sponge, after all), but it's not exactly a steal, either. Still, it's a good buy."
"McAfee 2012 installed fairly easily on all three of my computers - one with Windows Vista and two with Windows 7.

The full scan reports overall progress as well as a running count of issues found and fixed. A full scan on my desktop system with 500G hard drive took 48 minutes, which was faster than the software I had been using. .

When the scanner finds a virus, Trojan, or other serious threat it fixes the problem immediately. At the end of the scan it asks the user whether to quarantine any low-risk ""potentially unwanted programs."" On one of my computers, it requested a reboot to allow cleanup of locked files.

This product seems to handle malware that interferes with installation. The SiteAdvisor warns about dangerous websites, and the firewall blocks dangerous connections. There are also a few bonus tools.

I have noticed that some independent tests have not rated it real high, but I have found that it offers decent protection against malware attack and includes many extras, most impressively a full personal firewall."
Have used this product the last few years. Because we have been well protected; and have not had any problems. would have to say i expect to use in the future.
"I can't believe this upgrade isn't getting a solid five star rating!!!

Sure, it took over an hour to install. When I restarted I opened mail and I was prompted for my mail settings (WHATT??).  However, when I hit the ""next"" prompt the mail started up with all my message intact (whew!).

Okay, so what's so good about Snow Leopard?  First of all, your system will run much faster.  Safari opens faster and text loads quicker when your browsing web pages (although the photos load a little slower it seems).

Mail seems to open faster.

The new ""aqua"" desktop looks a little nicer (okay, that's worth about $5 to me).

The system shuts down faster.

All in all, for $25, this is a very worthwhile upgrade that will feel like you just upgraded your system to a faster processor.

So, it's worth it. Now everybody, let's get with the program and rate this upgrade five stars!"
Comfortable
Good Quality. Useful.
Seems to cure some of my PC's registration problems.
A good magazine
"This is a great alternative to Microsoft Office for certain documents.  I like Corel solutions for the small eBook publishing I do.  This software suite has PDF tools, creation and editing built in.  That's a huge plus for me.  I think this is superior to MS if you are adding photo and video to your documents.

However, I find PowerPoint and Excel easier to work with - despite the compatibility with Corel.  Word processing is no issue, and converts very easily.

X7 was very good.  This is better because the PDF functions work better for me."
"This is a very nice program for creating unique works of art, whether it is completely from scratch or from an existing photo.
I found that this program was generally fairly user friendly, even for people like me who aren't adept at photo editing. I am really a novice, and yet I was able to use and have fun with it.
Do be sure to check the system requirements and compare to what you have. This will not install on a 32bit operating system. My desktop has a 64bit processor, but my version of Windows 7 is the 32 bit version so I ended up installing it on my laptop. It installed easily there, and is stable, but my laptop only has 2G of RAM, and this program runs slowly on it. I'll be adding another 2G of memory to the laptop and I'm confident that it will run much better that way.
Both the desktop and the laptop are a few years old, newer systems will probably not be an issue as long as it is 64bit.
If you are not sure, in Windows from the start menu right click on ""Computer"" and the ""properties."" Make sure that next to ""system type"" it says 64 bit and not 32 bit."
"I understand that software is not always released fully bug free. Heck, I come from the whole of IBM PCs so I know that to be a fact. The problem for this software maker--Roxio is that Mac users expect better. They expect that when a program says it is going to do something, that it just works. The sad fact is that every time I used this software, some glitch got in my way of being happy about the outcome. I would always update the software before using it but while the bugs switched, they never fully went away. You are left feeling that you wasted money on an item that will never been truly usable. I used it 5 times before I uninstalled it to never use it again.

So I recommend using Toast version 10 or another product over this Toast 11. This toast is so burnt you never get the taste out of your mouth, no matter if you are a light user or a professional. If you do purchase it, plan to watch it like a hawk, update it and follow their forums."
"I've been buying Streets and Trips annually since 2003 and have always been satisfied using it as a backup mapping source. I first rely on my car navi. However, I'm too cheap to update the mapping DVD, so it isn't always up-to-date. I wish I could access Mapquest on the road, but I don't always have an Internet connection and am too poor to afford a connection card ;p This is Streets and Trips comes in. All the maps are saved on my hard drive and the maps have been pretty accurate and up-to-date for me. The only problems I've had are with new housing developments. But other than that, this really comes in handy. It also only costs $35. Not bad."
These are my favorite walk around shoes! I can wear them all day and not be in pain! Love em!
"I've used a number of programs designed to allow you to swap between Windows and MacOS, and this is my favorite. It is very stable on my system and it hasn't crashed yet. It is super easy to use (I am new to Mac) and it took very little manipulation to get it up and running.

I did run into a small problem (user error) and so I had a chance to work with customer support and they were very helpful."
It's all cars the average person can't relate to.
"I have used Roxio products in the past and found them to be user friendly and feature rich. I have not used their products for some time but have relied on iTunes and Windows Movie Maker to take care of my media needs. I have not spent a lot of time with Roxio Creator NXT 2 so far but what I have seen I really like. I played around with the slideshow creator long enough to learn how easy it is to create a slideshow with your photos. A large selection of background music is included to enhance the slideshow and I didn't find any of it to be too cheesy. The user also has a choice of using music from his own computer. The finished quality was very good and I liked the options to export the completed video. Also included are many templates for creating calendars, greeting cards, etc. with your photos. I have not tried it yet but I like the feature that allows the user to capture online video and/or internet radio. I am looking forward to spending more time learning how to use all the included features.

The only negative I could mention is the amount of time this software takes to install but I suppose that is to be expected with a program that has so many features and included media files."
"Fourth year with H&R Block's Tax Software and I am completely satisfied. There were no install issues despite having a previous version on the PC. I used this year's version to do returns for five family members that ranged from a super easy 1040EZ to a pretty complicated 1040 that included a home sale, a move and multiple short and long term capital gains / losses. The software performed smoothly and flawlessly for all five of the Federal and state returns."
"I love Trend Micro, and I love this new Titanium Maximum Security. I have it on 3 computers at home, and it is reliable and has protected me many times from opening a site or an e-mail that is potentially dangerous. I think Trend Micro is a top quality security software that does an excellent job of keeping unwanted viruses, spyware, and other junk of my computer. My experience for the last 7 or 8 years with Trend Micro has been excellent. I highly recommend this product."
The price of the product was nearly trippled since I bought Norton last time. Since 2015 all antivirus prices got increased except cheap McAfee.
"I think as Norton have tried to add more features, this thing has become too bloated and also too 'vocal' with popups coming up for everything, just like it needs to justify it's existence and expense somehow. I honestly think that the less resource-intensive and free offerings such as the Microsoft offering and even AVG, coupled with taking some care what attachments and links you click on are far better than spending money on this sort of thing."
"I've used H & R Block tax software for over 10 years.  I worked as a tax preparer for 20 years, and this software is as good as the professional software I used."
"A quick and to the point review of PCtools anti-spyware:

How does PCtools compare with the rest of the anti-spyware in the market ?
PCtools is the best, I have personally tried and tested Mcshield, Trend micro ...  PCtools is the best in both protecting your computer as well as having the least performance impact on the processing.

Will PCtools protect and remove all the spyware on my computer ?
Yes, it is remove most (90%) of the spyware, but not all. Download and install a free version of 'super anti spyware' - which will be able to remove most of the spyware on your computer.  Trust me, it is not a rogue wave, the free version works pretty well.

Will PCtools slow down the performance of my computer ?
To some extent yes, but if you bought your computer anywhere in the last 5 years, the configuration should be good enough to run PCtools antispyware without much impact on the performance.

Why should you buy a buy a anti-spyware ?
There are lots of free anti-spyware, but very few of them really work and remove the spyware on your computer.  Infact there are equally good number of rogue-antispyware which promise to remove spyware, but they are spyware themselves.

Here is a listing of all the rogue anti-spyware, so pls stay away from installing any of these:
[...]

How is the support ?
I am not too sure, you judge yourself with my experience with PCtools support :  my laptop was infected with Trojan. FakeAlert on Saturday evening and I created a ticket with PCtools online, I even uploaded the results of a malware detective utility that came with the scanner - there was no response from them till Monday morning and when I checked the status of the ticket - it was in closed status.  They did not even let me know that it was closed.

However, on Sunday I had resolved the issues myself by using the free Super anti-spyware hence did not worry too much about followin up with them."
I love using the voice recognition software on my MacBook Pro. But one of the drawbacks is you have to be connected to the Internet for it to work. If you don't have a connection your voice recognition does not work. So I got this to fill them with my voice recognition needs. It seems installed easily but when I went to use it I couldn't get it to work. I called the company and they gave me a workaround. But it was a too much of a hassle. So I just use my voice recognition program on my iPhone and write in Evernote. Then transfer the informationThen transfer the information onto my MacBook using my Evernote account. It's a great and easy solution so I never got Dragon Dictate to actually work.
"I've tried 3 Crest Mouthwashes in the last month and this one is definitely the best.  The wintergreen taste was appealing to everyone in the family that uses mouthwash, and I found that the fresh feeling lasted for a very long time.

The best part about this mouthwash for my family is that it doesn't have alcohol.  Thus this bottle is going in the children's bathroom.  Not that they would be stupid enough to drink mouthwash, but currently my daughter is on medication where any form of alcohol is best avoided."
"So I couldn't use it. That was disappointing. I will update the review if and when I upgrade my system, but for the time being, I didn't expect this incompatibility for a relatively new computer."
I was very happy with my card.  No problem at all.
Easy to install if you have a Microsoft account
"This software has a nice interface and plenty of features for the home/consumer video enthusiast. There's also a great user support forum linked to the publisher's website.

Unfortunately, I found the program to be somewhat buggy and cannot recommend it. The most significant issue was that my PC's DVD drive wasn't recognized by the program when it was time to burn a disk. There were numerous, time consuming workarounds and fixes mentioned on the Video Studio forum. One user even solved his issue with the software by reinstalling his PC's operating system. But who wants to go through all that?

I downloaded the trial versions of Sony's Vegas Pro and DVD Architect Pro, as a previous reviewer suggested, and they worked just fine on the same PC. Those programs are definitely worth the extra money if you value your time."
Nice gift. More selections are needed
"I was using 2011 version of Kaspersky Anti-Virus on a few pc's at home. Overall I was impressed with the 2011 version and I am as well on the 2012 version. Installation was easy and the program doesn't get in the way of your user experience on the pc. I had no problems installing this version and so far my pc has not slowed down because of the program. I like having the 3 user addition as it is a good value for covering all of your home pc's in one easy to manage license key. This way when it comes up for renewal its easy to renew once for all 3 pc's.

I like having simple anti-virus rather then the full security suites as sometimes those programs can become to much functionality for advanced users but they do offer good protection for those who are not advanced users. For me, I like straight anti-virus and this one is good."
"This software is just for video file playback.  It doesn't do any editing.  It's just a player.  There are so many free players out there, and I really can't tell that big a difference in quality.  It works well, but it's just another video player.  I would recommend passing on this product unless you are a serious critic of typical video playback quality."
I always trust kaspersky internet security and prefer it over other stuff in the market. Unlike other antivirus products kaspersky doesnt make your system slow or doesnt take ages to run a full scan. Recommend kaspersky to everyone.
"Review update:

While Essie states 'up to 14 days', one has to assess what effects those 14 days.

First off, this is an extremely pale opaque white with a hint of pink.

Application will require 3 even light coats of this shade, followed by its top coat.  Let dry thoroughly between.  Not quite the gel shine tho.

This color is pale, which could account for results.

This polish will hold up well for two or three days if nails are protected somewhat. It will show signs of wear and small chipping at nail tips. It can be touched up effectively."
This was exactly what I needed.  The Company provided good communication in regards to receiving my order and shipping information.  Very pleased
Winzip 15 standard plus doesn't need any introduction. It does what they advertise and has been very reliable over the years. Recommended.
"Great gift, cute box, fast shipping"
Pretty good deal of purchasing the gift card online and then shop locally.
"Item arrived quickly, item as described"
"Microsoft Office Professional 2010 - 2PC/1User (Disc Version)

I've been using Microsoft Office since the Stone Age. After Word Perfect fell off the road from Take-Overitis, I made the leap to Office and never looked back. Now we have the current version from 2010. It is very nice and a nice upgrade from 2007 but the pricing model can be a bit unwieldy. It's expensive, there's no way around it. There's a lot of competition out there, some of it free, and a high price model is not good going forward. There is a Home version, but I use Outlook and have for years. So I need a Pro version.

Outlook got the biggest make-over this time around and I like what they did. The Ribbon-Bar is full of choices but not too troublesome to navigate. Still, with my mail now in the ""Cloud"", using Hotmail, I wish it was a more robust cloud interface. I still need to start on a now empty PST folder and click over to the Hotmail cloud folder. Overall though I still like using Outlook for my front end to my mail, but it is getting old. It needs a Cloud refresh.

Word and Excel are still the tried and true apps of this generation. They are the best and won't disappoint. PowerPoint is well, a clich&eacute;. Every demonstration is made on it, if it isn't made on Keynote. Still I can't get over that Microsoft hasn't done an unbundled support pricing structure. I can't remember the last time I called for help and would love a lower price to match that. If I need help, say past the first 30 days, well, I'll pay for it then. Yet this is the Office Suite among suites. I have to say you get a big deal here, it's just expensive."
"The Artist's Magazine is full of advice and ideas for anyone studying or teaching art; from its first monthly department, ""Dialogue"", which is a question and answer column from readers, to the final page ""Master Class"", which gives the history and analysis of a famous work, you will get articles that cover many techniques and media, as well as guidelines on the business side of art.
Taking the March 2003 issue as an example, the cover story is on the exquisite gouache paintings of Daniel K. Tennant. One of the four works pictured is broken down and shown in six stages, from the initial layout to the final delicate details.
Artist Joseph Frassetta explains his technique in ""Reining it In"", and tells us what materials and tools he uses to create his realistic portraiture and animal studies.
There is another article on landscape painting through the four seasons, and others on doing a self-portrait, mixing the use of colored pencils, and so much more. Some favorite monthly articles are ""Art Clinic"" and ""Technical Q&A"", which always have useful tips.
The back of the magazine has classified listings of art related opportunities, workshops, etc., and even the ads can be an informative resource.
The Artist's Magazine also sponsors a yearly competition, with many categories, including a student/beginner division.
The magazine has medium weight paper, good color reproduction, and  teachers and students, especially of a traditional style of art, will find much to enjoy and learn in every issue."
"Love this internet security product. I have it on all my computers. My son was having a problem with his Kapersky security, so I bought Trend Micro Pro for him. Great price and quick shipment. Super product and telephone support. Can't beat that deal!"
favorite soap since it has only a slight scent. It has shea butter in it. It does not leave a soap residue
"It took a little over an hour for me to do a full media install of  Glo Premium on my ASUS, Windows 7, laptop.

Glo's features are listed in the Amazon's Product Description so I won't go into those.  I've been using this program off and on for a few weeks now. I think the loading time..switching between the lenses, topics, multi-media, etc..sometimes takes a few seconds  but is fairly quick for such a large program. If I ever become an owner of a tablet, IPod Touch or IPad, I plan on downloading the Glo Bible IPad app & syncing my notes and/or bookmarks to the device. I hope to prepare presentations for Children's Church. By the way, the collection of media in this program is amazing. There's HD video,  articles, photos, art, 360 degree virtual tours & more. I needed to use 'Help' to learn how to find my way around.

As a test,  I did a search for Galatians 5:22; first it turned up nothing, but then I did a search in Galatians & also on the home page both searches pulled up the verse, 2 photos and a map. Clicking on the verse took me to the Galations 5,  the highlighted Bible passage, study notes and a map. Clicking the photos brought up the photo, its description and other pertinent info.  Clicking on the map brought up even more information. By the way, the amount of information that is brought up can be overwhelming.

Check out The Glo Blog, News & Updates on All Things Glo, g l o b i b l e. com / blog/  to learn how to use Glo in your presentations, and the usefulness of the right-click context menu. Clicking on 'Features' at the top of the page might be helpful to you too. Be sure to use the 'help' menu in this program too. If the web address isn't showing in my review, just do a search for Glo Bible Blog to find the web page.

This program has many features, as I used it, I could only think that it needed a few more. To make this program perfect & even more useful to me, I'd like to see the following added:

Audible dictionary; I'd like to be able to click on a word, go to the definition & also hear how it's pronounced.

A few more Bible versions; currently it has NIV 1984 & 2010, KJV, The Message & ESV. I'd like to see NLT added. I'd also like the Bible versions in parallel format so I could read the same passage in different versions side-by-side.

I wish the Bible timeline also showed the events happening in world history.

And, I  wish the Life Application Notes were included.

In my opinion, adding these items would make this software perfect!

This program is huge with many, many interactive features; it can be overwhelming. Take your time, don't feel intimidated & soon you'll be comfortable with the wealth of information found in Glo Premium.

UPDATE: I recently rec'd an IPod Touch & added the Glo Bible App; now I have Glo Premium on my IPod Touch, it syncs with the program on my laptop. Some of the Premium features are not included in the IPod app. I'm loving this on the IPod."
I am a fairly well educated person who is handy around the house.  It took a 25 minute call with Microsoft customer support to get the box open.  Customer support had to pull up a diagram and walk me through 18 steps.
This was the cutest box.
Item as described and very useful for last minute meal
You can get the bundle discount on digital downloads of Quicken and Turbo Tax even though the digital purchase does not go through the cart.  After phoning customer support I purchased Turbo Tax and then purchased Quicken.  At payment time for the Quicken the total was reduced by the $35 bundle reduction.  So it did work :-)
"Not sure what I can add to the other reviews.  H&R Block is a useful tool for filing your taxes, and if you file electronically it really speeds up your refund.  I have use both H&R block and Turbo Tax in the last few years, both work good for me, H&R Block has been the better deal the last two years."
"Largely my fault for not reading carefully, but the high synthetic fiber content made the shirt uncomfortable to the touch.  Not the manufacturer's fault, of course."
"The clean, color-themed pages are easy on the eyes.  The Lists, Chic on the Street, Gift Guide, Work the Look, Extras accessories, and Fabulous at Every Age are all artistically presented and united by colors, metals, and gems.  Although I don't like most of the individual pieces, I thoroughly enjoy looking at the way Harper's talented staff juxtapose and arrange them so delightfully. The Beauty section names reasonably priced skin and hair products as well as new spa and exercise ideas for health.

I find Vogue's ugly and decadent look in editorial and advertising pages repulsive and boring, with only occasional great photos. W wallows in kinky deviance. Lucky features inelegant, garish clothes that look like like a catalog of what clothing manufacturers have sent to be photographed.

Uniquely, Harper's Bazaar is a delightful monthly guide to current fashion.  Thank you, Harper's!"
"Classic magazine, look forward to it every month."
"At least once a week, this program starts giving the message ""Norton Antivirus does not support the Repair Utility. Please uninstall and reinstall."" This entails going through an hour of uninstalling the program then installing it again. It will work for awhile but, after an update or two, the same error will reappear. Tech support says the solution is to uninstall and reinstall. I'd rather spend an hour reloading my system after a virus once or twice a year than have to go through this week after week. I can't recommend this product, though I have liked past Norton products."

"The only good thing I can say about this is that it comes with an ancestory.com trial. The previous versions were better. The menus and options have changed, and not in a good way. Things that used to be easy are now convoluted. I would not recommend it."
"There is a lot of functionality here, which makes it an acceptable program for photo editiing.  The menu is easy to access, and there are not very many mystery icons that force you to guess.  I can do all the basics like fix red eye, cut out portions of photos, airbrush, and easily sync and manage my pictures in one location.

It is far from perfect though.  The loading time is over 40 seconds, which is way too long for a mid-range photo editior program.  There are at some key functions missing.  I cannot resize images pieces that I've cut out, which my free Windows Paint program can do.  The image review carousel is also too small.  I have a 20 inch screen, and most of my images have to be viewed as a small thumbnails instead of midsized photos.

Fix these problems, and take out the spyware, and we will have a 5 star program."
I originally had thought this was going to be a poor product based on all of the bad reviews written here and on my past experiences with some other Norton products. It has actually turned out to be a very good product for me. I installed it on the family PC running XP SP2. It was easy to install and I did not encounter any problems at all. The program has worked wonderfully now for a couple of weeks. It removed several spyware programs and has tuned up the computer quite well. I had AT&T's internet suite before this and was not happy with it. This seems to be doing a better job because my computer now seems to run faster and smoother. I will update this review again after a month of using it. So far I like it.
"This year I decided to go with the download version instead of the physical disc. It worked great, it looks like that's the way I''ll be buying my copies in the future. As described, didn't have to worry aboiut shippingshipped promptly,  lowest price I could find on the Internet plus had the Amazon guarantee. What more could you ask? I'm happy"
I absolutely love this product and buy for myself and all of my friends.  Can't say enough about these.
Smells great good packaging easy to squeeze out
I love this magazine. However every since I moved I have not received my magazines and I put in my new address.
"World number 1? That's an understatement. Maybe if your world limited to your balcony its ok but in my world its a scam.
It came preinstalled on my computer and when I try to use it it miserably fail. So I installed my favored number 100 DVDFab--free for lifetime, does open any disk, gives you options like watch in pre-screen, subtitles, any region,  etc."
"Like others I was using Norton McAfee before.  Here's what I liked about this - and the one thing that keeps it from getting five stars.
1. Doesn't take as much RAM
2. Not a lot of annoying pop-ups and things telling I need to do something
3. All-in-one perfection ease - covers everything so that I don't have to have another protect me from various web issues (phishing, putting data in unsecure sites, etc.)
4. Covers up to three computers --- my laptops and my desktop.
5. Ease of set-up - simple, accomplished in no time and it simultaneously (w/ my permission) removed my McCaffee

One downside on mine and one that I've heard from a friend (am not counting that one towards my review - but, might want to be something you check out if it relevant to you...)
Mine: Lately, it has random crashes of the web site protection feature.  Doesn't hurt my computer - but just stops working and tells me so.  So far, haven't had any security breaches I know of.
A friends: He used a VPN connection on his computer and something in the Norton settings messed it up entirely (those VPN connections can always be a little tricky to me - and I don't have one on any of the ones I've installed it into)

BOTTOM LINE: I like it far better and feel better protected with this easy to use all-in-one security system over McCaffee and it's priced much lower than I paid for that one for a single license."
"This is the second year that I've purchased H&R Block Premium + State Tax prep software. I'd been wanting to try it for years, but my husband always did our taxes (some exercise in self-flagellation that I've never understood...) prior to that and despite the struggle putting pen to paper, he was reluctant to e-file until he made a mistake on our 2013 taxes. Not wanting to appear overly eager to dive in with the tech-rescue I suggested tax prep software and letting me have a go at it.  He mulled it over and said OK, so I then started reading reviews; deciding to go with H&R based upon the positives I'd read.

I had not completed my own taxes for over 25 years, so I was a tad intimidated by the prospect of doing them at all. Fortunately my experience with last year's H&R software was very positive, and left me feeling empowered, not fearful that I'd done it incorrectly.

Ultimately there were no errors and the filing was quickly accepted by the feds with an extremely fast e-file to refund payment. (My husband was THRILLED with that part of it!) That experience led me to purchase the 2015 software for tax preparations this year.

Right now my daughter is applying to colleges and we'll be filling out the FAFSA (Federal Financial Aid form) and the CSS Profile (Financial Aid form for private colleges) on January 1st. While I don't expect to have all the info I need to complete my taxes on that day, if I do I can use this software to easily complete it and accurately fill out these forms. If I don't have the info it's recommended to estimate earnings and taxes on the forms, but then after e-filing taxes, that info can quickly be uploaded to replace estimates. Yet another reason that e-filing is the way to go.

As for using this software in general, having all the proper information (W-2's etc...) was really important, as was having a list of deductions (we did itemized deductions due to a large number of medical bills). I needed the Premium version as I'm an independent contractor (freelance writer), and this version addresses self-employment (Schedule C reported income).

I like how this software 'interviews' you. It asks you questions and if you don't know the answer it offers help as to where to locate the information and tries to clarify information as needed. H&R also offers help to users via unlimited online chat with tax experts. You can work on part of your return and then save it to come back to it. It's a process that could take months or a few hours depending upon how complicated your return is and whether or not you have all the required information.

I purchased the 'Frustration Free' option and it came in a plain, white cardboard envelope inside an Amazon box with other items. I nearly threw it out thinking it was packing material!  The CD and installation instructions with an Activation code are what you get. Installation on my Windows 7 PC was super easy, and last year's tax info (W2s, 1099s and last years return) was immediately imported by this year's software.

According to the software the next update will be January 7th. Updates are fairly frequent, but the software offers to check for one each time you open it so you're never out of date. You also are asked what state return you wish to file, and this too is updated as needed.

In paying for this software you have up to 5 Federal returns for free. The State filing costs an additional $19.95 per return. You can input your credit card info for that transaction securely through the software.

While a tad daunting at first (because I didn't want to mess anything up...) this software does a great job at guiding the user to a successful conclusion. It explains things in effective detail so the user feels informed versus overwhelmed. The logical progression of needed information in the software makes it easier for users who are unfamiliar with doing their own taxes to gather the needed information and have it at their fingertips to add to the software. Filing both the federal and state returns is done easily, and error checking (accuracy review) is done multiple times prior to filing to ensure you have accurately filled out the forms and maximized your deductions.

H&R Block has produced a useful bit of software that techs and non-techs alike can effectively use to complete their taxes. It's Q&A style in gathering information is easy to follow and the results are better than expected.  It's a product that produced accurate, fast results for us last year, and it's the product I knew I wanted to buy this year too because of my prior year's experience.

If you're doing your own taxes, I highly recommend it.

----------------------------------

UPDATE: 2/18/16

Finished my taxes (Federal and State) with this software to provide accurate FAFSA information for a college bound student. The software submitted my e-file and I had the Federal portion accepted within minutes of submission, and the State portion accepted the next day.

Since I had to pay federal taxes this year I deferred payment by direct removal from my checking account (something you can direct the software to do as late as 4/18/16) instead of paying a fee to pay by credit card.

Taxes are not fun, but this software definitely makes them easier to submit and understand.

"This is a justified upgrade for all Office 97, 2000 and some Office XP users. Office has evolved into a system of information gathering tools, a set of solutions for ideas, communication, connecting people and places. Intense XML (extensible markup language) integration for generating solutions that are compatible with today's, tomorrow and future standards. The updated applications integrate with the Windows XP experience featuring a bolder inviting interface. I am disappointed with the default use of the current theme in Windows XP, but with the new tool bar icons, it makes you forget about that. Overall it's a wonderful work experience with Office 2003. The suite offers improved reliability and stability, because of the integration with the supported operating systems. Once the suite is installed, you don't have to restart your computer, just start using the applications, the suite even has its own default programs group (finally), which keeps your programs menu less cluttered.
Word 2003 includes development tools that add dynamic features to documents making them powerful than ever. The power beneath all this is XML, allowing the user to embed components for updating data in documents such as stock quotes. Word 2003 offers simple, familiar yet improved features regular users are accustomed to. Majority of the features in Word 2003 are aimed primarily toward businesses and the Enterprise. But are still necessary for the average user because of the control over information across all the Office applications. Tools such as Information Rights Management (IRM), (this controls the flow of information to specific users), persons can be restricted on how they use your Office files; whether it's printing or sharing, very powerful! Reading view is an enhanced mode of print preview; documents are laid out in virtual pages reducing the need to print. The Task Pane is also improved by offering resources to look up information on a particular topic being typed; this is a feature across the core Office applications. Lots of other great features make Word 2003 a worthy upgrade.
Excel is a XML mammoth because of the integration with the language. The ability to migrate data between different storage sources and extraction of information to make it flexible in different scenarios. Tables can be transferred back and forth between applications such Word with ease. Excel can continually use the tables from documents as a data source for further expandability. It's the flexibility for data exchange that makes Excel 2003 very powerful.
Outlook, is so revamped, this alone is a worthy upgrade. Three panes in Outlook 2003 make e-mail an enjoyable experience. The Mail Pane holds all of the necessary tools found in prior versions of Outlook such as the Outlook Bar, and the different folders such as inbox, calendar, etc. The second pane gives an expanded view of the different items listed in the Mail Pane, like your incoming mail, contacts and calendar, which makes reading these information resources easier on the eye and productive by providing a better view. Reading your e-mail in the third pane (Preview Pane), the user views the message in portrait layout, more content is seen compared to prior versions. Its even better to view e-mails with ""Clear Type"" turned on for Windows XP users. Other features such as improved Virus and Spam protection makes Outlook 2003 a great upgrade. Outlook is not placed on the desktop by default, it can also be minimized to the system tray in Windows, for users connected to an Exchange Server, this displays all the network settings available.
PowerPoint 2003 offers the same features of version 2002, but what makes it an enticing upgrade is the package to CD feature that allows users to save presentations onto CD-ROMS. The PowerPoint Viewer included with each Package to CD allows it to be played on other computer systems even if PowerPoint is not installed. Windows media integration is also in PowerPoint 2003, which makes watching presentations more fun and exciting. The effects are fantastic when combined with these elements. The ability to integrate videos into Presentations to create home movies has long been a request of users, even if they have a DVD burner. For the PowerPoint 2000 user this is a worthy upgrade that provides simple yet Powerful tools to take presentation graphics to a new level.
This new version of Access is also XML integrated, enhanced features such as extraction of data from multiple tables, Access 2003 also improves Smart Tag integration. The ability to design solutions within the program makes web services a powerful resource for the enterprise; the flawless integration with Microsoft SQL makes information sharing a productive experience. This makes data storing and retrieval an easy way to control how data is implemented across many scenarios using personalized solutions, allowing your information to have a stronger impact across the Enterprise.
Publisher has become a mainstream Office application because of its integration with other Office programs. It connects to product databases; the Mail Merge feature is much improved because it's the same one as Microsoft Word, which offers greater ease of use. The Start Center is awesome, which makes starting publications an organized experience for the user. The interface is less cluttered and more customizable. You can rename pages like Workbooks for better searching, if you are typing large publications. The website features are easier to use; it provides satisfactory integration with FrontPage, for converting websites created in Publisher. With a total of 45 design master sets, users can create attractive e-mails that are fully compatible with many messaging services. The ability to merge data sources using text and images is great. Compatibility goes back to Publisher 2000, which is a draw back for users who might be using Publisher 98 or under.
Outlook Business Contact Manager is an application that offers features for Small Businesses for generating customer reports and e-mailing customers.
Picture Manager has replaced Photo-Editor; it has better image editing tools, more functionality and ease of use.
Office 2003 is a worthy upgrade for many users, especially persons still in an existing Office 97 or 2000 user base. The tools it provides offers a powerful productivity experience that makes information accessible, controllable and connected for you the user.
The suite and all the Office 2003 applications are supported only on Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, Windows XP all editions."
"WillMaker Plus provides a decent way to create a will without having a costly and complicated legal consultation.  The software was easy to use and most of the terms were explained well and had more detailed references available.  One section which I found to be really useful for most people is the advanced directive.  Many people do not realize how important it is to make their decisions about life support known to their family, this software makes that process easy. The software does have some hiccups and the constant attempts to get one to upgrade are rather annoying considering this is paid software and not a free trial.  Overall,  at this price point everyone can afford to have a ""will"" to prevent their loved ones from going through the complex probate process in the event of death."

"I am an Army Reservist and had to learn Arabic really quickly.  I used Rosetta Stone and couldn't believe how fast I learned Arabic basics.  Well, I'm back from the Middle East and can tell you that what they teach you is applicable and correct.
So, I am planning a trip to Italy in a few months and immediately thought of Rosetta Stone because I only know as much Italian as what I have heard from watching the Saprano's.  I have been using the system for the last couple of month's now and I feel very confident in being able to carry on a basic conversation in Italian and I am only though 1/2 of the course.  I'm astonished.
For those not familiar with Rosetta Stone's programs, they are hand's down the easiest way to learn a language.  Just brief over the basic instructions, put the disc in your drive, and start--it's that simple!  You don't have to pour over manuals, dictionaries, audio discs/tapes or history books.
I've tried Berlitz and many other programs in the past that required all of those other 'tools' and their systems depended on memorization.  Other programs don't work for me.  Rosetta stone uses another approach by allowing you to learn a language in a way that allows you to UNDERSTAND the language instead of MEMORIZING a language. If I can't remember a shopping list, how can I memorize an entire language?

By the way, the US Army offers only 1 language program free to soldiers and it's Rosetta Stone...because it is the only one that works."

"Edited 2.18.2014
I cannot even express my outrage and disgust over the two ""apologies"" I have received from Intuit over the downgrade of their TurboTax product, and their offer of $25 to ""make it right."" Apparently the Tylenol Effect has worn off, and this is the sort of corporate mumblemumble that passes for responsibility.

******************************

Like so many other longtime TurboTax users, I reviewed my 2013 return to double-check the schedules I'd need.  Sure enough, I needed to move up two levels from my trusted TT Deluxe to TT Personal & Small Business to prepare my 2014 taxes using the same tax events as in years past. I'm deeply concerned that some aspect of this new return will be critically inconsistent with years prior, and trigger an audit. At this point I'm ready to forgo Amazon's 10% bonus, and turn to H&R Block software simply for a fresh start and some peace of mind.

I was talking with a friend who is a CPA, and apparently the Intuit dissatisfaction extends across all levels of their product line; TurboTax, QuickBooks, Quicken for Mac, on and on. She has had a wretched time preparing W-2's and other tax documents for her clients this year, all due to changes with Intuit's software for TY 2014. This is a company that has built a strong customer base over decades; I know, my family was involved from almost day one. This is as disgraceful as it gets, treating customers as dupes in a game of bait and switch which many will not realize until too late."
Windows 7 still the best Operating System Microsoft has released blows windows 8 out of the water and loved the price.
"Kaspersky Lab is a Russian computer security company and ranks fourth in the market share for antivirus software. This software includes Safe Money.  That's an interesting program that allows the user to visit a site whose security credentials aren't yet established while at the same time allowing for a ""sandboxed"" transaction. It slows down my Windows 7 environment but that's the cost of running the two."
"EDIT 1-11-2008
In the begining when I first tried VISTA I hated it because it did not play well with all my computers. Now Microsoft has got a lot of the bugs worked of the OS and it runs great and is stable. Microsoft still has TERRIBLE customer support. I hate being treated like a criminal everytime I call them. I raise my rating from 1 star to 3."

"I've used McAfee Internet Security for years and years.  Use it on my laptop and my PC.  It installed easily enough with no problems, as usual.  I don't feel my laptop slow down or get sluggish when the automatic daily scans are in process.  I LOVE the clean up of junk on my computers function that this has.  I am not at all a computer geek so, I really appreciate when I need to install software on my computer and there are no problems.  Even more than that, I love that when I'm finished with the install, the software works.  This install was from a product key number that I used after going onto the McAfee website.  I can't believe how times have changed.  No more CD necessary to install this.  No heavy price to buy the boxed CD.  This was really inexpensive through an Amazon market place seller, as it was last year from another seller.  To me, if it is sold through Amazon in any way, I feel confident because I have NEVER had a problem with anything concerning Amazon, whether a purchase, a question or a resolution to any (even tiny) issue.  Yes, I recommend this."
"It is difficult to determine how effective this product isin the short term as far as keeping my computer ""healthy:, as stated.  BUT it is not difficult to see how this has slowed down my computer.  I cannot believe how much time is wasted. There are frequent McAfee downloads, many of which prevent simultaneous work on the computer.  I am not happy to be in the middle of something and have to wait for a current download to complete itself.  I am removing this from my computer!"
"It was easy to install and already has stop viruses.  I have been using AVG but I think I like Avast a bit better.  It certainly difficult to determine which Antivirus program I like better. Reports have the other Virus programs a being better.  I have used some that literally take over the computer.  You know this is there but it is not bothersome. Interfacing with us humans is very important to me.

So after a month of use I may change all my computers to Avast by the end of the year."
"I've been using Painter since version 4, back when Fractal Design was still behind it. It's always been THE app for artists who want to recreate the look of natural media within the digital space. I was delighted when I received this new version to review.

Over the years, Painter has been moving toward a close compatibility with Photoshop. Not only can you import/export Painter files to Photoshop, but the GUI has also moved from a more idiosyncratic one to one that mirrors the thinking behind PSD. And Painter's natural-media library is so extensive, the app is now beyond compare -- there isn't another app out there that really competes in terms of media replication.

I still use Photoshop and Painter for my digital art. Both apps have their strengths, and Corel has done a great job of ensuring an almost seamless workflow twixt the two apps. Photoshop can be used to make great digital art, especially if you're pretty good with creating brushes, using blend modes and creating texture overlays. But it can't beat Painter for mimicking natural media at a basic ""stroke"" level. If you want your digital work to look like watercolors, pastels, oils, etc., that have been rendered ""by hand,"" Painter is the tool for you.

By the way, if your art mainly consists of pencil and/or pen work, the much cheaper&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Autodesk-SketchBook-Pro-7-Download/dp/B00LH6ZWIG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Autodesk SketchBook Pro 7 [Download</a>] is a great option for that. I've used and reviewed SketchBook in the past, and it's great for line work and broad color overlays/fill-ins. I don't use SketchBook  that often because 1) I already own Painter and it does the line work just as well as SketchBook and 2) Painter's coloring and paint-modeling options are greater than Sketchbook's. But if you don't need the extensive range of natural-media effects Painter offers and you're basically looking for a very good sketch app, keep SketchBook in mind.

BTW, I use a Wacom with Painter and I should mention a tablet greatly aids in the natural media reproduction. That being said, I have used a mouse for Painter and still gotten very good results. But if you get Painter and you're serious about taking advantage of all it can deliver, you'll probably want to invest in a graphics tablet at some point. So figure in the cost of that when you purchase this program. (Even a less-expensive tablet will greatly improve the look of your strokes within the app.)

SUMMARY: Painter is not a cheap app, so if you just need an app that will allow you to create line work and/or very flat artwork, Photoshop and SketchBook will work for you. But if you're an artist looking to recreate natural media to a pretty amazing degree, Painter is worth the money. Nothing else currently available can best this app at what this app sets out to do."
"I ordered this magazine because it was on sale and I thought it would do well in our medical waiting room. I didn't expect to find 1/2 dozen ideas (many from the ads) in each issue that I could use in my own (Mid-Century Modern) home.  Very well done.

Addendum:  Been receiving this for months now and am always impressed with how interesting and innovative it is.  I love their advice this month to ""Choose a contractor who listens to bluegrass."""
"Both of these products work well together.  The shampoo has an earthy smell,  but it is not unpleasant.  I feel that I am losing less hair.  Maybe it even feels thicker.  I know it is growing faster."
"I was curious about this product, since I am a faithful user of the McAfee SiteAdvisor Firefox addon, which is free.

This product installed immediately, and I couldn't find anything new that it offered me. This program acts as a surreptitious bar down on your internet browser toolbar that uses a color coded system of letting you know when you are browsing user reported safe sites or bad ones. I find this product EXTREMELY useful for all users, advanced or novice, because you never know when you do happen to stumble on a website that is loaded with viruses and spyware. This program acts as an alert to tell you which one you are in fact visting.

It doesn't take up any CPU, that I can tell, and it does have a community feature that allows you to view what others have written about the site and why they thought it was good or bad. I think maybe I would just stick with the free add on that is offered on the web versus paying for this, because I did not see anything that was new with the ""Plus"" program.

Regardless, I recommend everyone to have this SiteAdvisor on every computer you own, this is coming from someone who has had to format countless times because of virus and spyware absconding into depths that my virus/spyware programs couldn't find.

Great Product."
"I used almost every Microsoft operating system since MSDOS. Windows 8.1 is comparable to Vista, Windows ME, and Windows 3.0. All were losers.
.
The biggest problem was the elimination of familiar functions that existed in the past generations of Windows. When it took me 25 minutes to reset the screen resolution and another 20 minutes to locate the setup for my wireless router, I threw up my hands, deleted the upgrade, and went back to Windows 7.
.
The second biggest problem was incorporating tiles on a desktop monitor. For small screen tablets, this feature is essential. For a large desktop monitor, it is useless. Most manufacturers do not make touch sensitive features on large monitors."

"I needed basic security on my computer at home. This worked well. It took about fifteen minutes to  install but I do have an older computer. After I ran a scan that seemed like forever , It did pick up malware that my other software did not. I like that this can be used on other devices as well. It was very to add my phone to it as well. I am glad that it does do it job compared to other software programs that just did one thing."
"I have been a Quicken user for 13 years.  I upgraded to 2007 and it lost some of my data during the conversion.  After several hours with support (live chat) they never found a solution.

Then they say to call them and Intuit wants to charge me twenty four dollars to get assistance for their bug.  Sorry Intuit, you have gotten too big and have forgotten the customers who made you.  Over the last few years your customer service has gotten worse.  You just don't care anymore.  I think it may be time for me to move on to other vendors.

If you are happy with your current, reliable, Quicken version stick with it.  I was on 2002 and am going back to it.  However, I think I will try out some of Quickens competitors.  Never thought I would say that as a huge Quicken fan."
"I have previous versions of PaintShop and the first thing I noticed is that it's speedier than in the past. This is a welcome improvement. There's lots to like about the product - many tools, controls and effects. You can apply a change via the batch mode to many files. There are lens corrections and correction for chromatic aberrations. There are lots of layer controls. Read the product description for all about the many changes.

Most of the interface seems fundamentally the same. I found my way around again without having to consult the manual. I'm also an Adobe product user and like this mainly for being cheaper than Photoshop, but it brings many of the features that I like, such as overlaying text. I like the relatively simple interface too. Another of the improvements in this version is the automatic text wrapping feature. Simply start typing in the text box and things will move around as needed. This is a feature I like in some of the MS Office products that helps greatly in layout work.

You can move people around (I see this more of a creative feature than one that would be used to move people around to make the photo more pleasing - but your mileage may vary). They've also enhanced the Text and Shape cutting tools.

I can't speak to the raw handling, my camera isn't supported yet - I'm hoping that happens soon. Check  Corel's web site to see if you're interested in raw format and whether your camera is supported. Most are.

If you're looking for a good photo software tool - this is an excellent one. If you're looking to upgrade, going from X6 would definitely be worth it for many new features. X7, not as much - check the comparison matrix at Corel's web site to see if you are interested in the new features. The Ultimate version may be worth it to you if you want the add-ons that make the Ultimate edition."
"This PRE DE PROVENCE PATCHOULI SHEA BUTTER ENRICHED SOAP (250 Gram) has the mild, musky fragrance that many women find sexy, but the fragrance is risky.  To some people (including me) it smells like fungus or damp basement.  Still, this soap may appeal to male household members, because it's so different from most other Pre de Provence soaps (with their fairly strong, flowery fragrances).

This is a large bar of luxurious French soap.  It lathers beautifully, and the fragrance never lingers too long.  The soap is very gentle, and doesn't irritate sensitive skin.

For men, a much safer Pre de Provence soap is the Sandalwood bar (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pre-de-Provence-Sandalwood/dp/B01LWWOLW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pre de Provence Sandalwood</a>)."
"I installed this on 2 Windows laptops (Windows 7 and 8), and an Android tablet.  Installation was fairly easy on all of the devices.

I've used AVG Free version for several years, with no problems.  I decided to try this Kaspersky Internet Security product since it was offered to me through the Amazon Vine program.  So far, I have no complaints.  It updates automatically, and seems unobtrusive."
"Like many other PC geeks, I looked at Windows XP and its eye-candy UI with suspicion when it first came out, but I've come to love it.  It's rock solid -- I've never had a single system crash in the last two years, even though as a gadget freak I install and try out new hardware a lot -- it's fast, and its plug-n-play feature is so much better than any other operating system.  Service Pack 2 makes XP even better, esp. in the security arena.  It now comes with a better firewall and turns off some default settings that used to be on which could invite security problems.  (The flip side of this increased security meausre is you constantly get warnings.)

XP Home is great for home use.  If you want file system-level encryption, true file permission settings and more networking options, opt for the Professional edition.

I highly recommend teh book ""Windows XP Inside Out, 2nd edition"" if you are interested in optimzing your XP system and/or learning advanced techniques."
"I thought the McAfee programs were bad about being memory pigs, but I've never seen ANY program that can come even close to being as big of a HOG AS THIS ONE! With it just running in the background, and only this,I checked my Windows Task Manager and it was using over 700 MB of memory and had the CPU pegged at 100%.
 Yes, my computer is a little old. But its not that bad! It has a 1.7 Ghz processor, 512 mg of ram. Its an old Dell OptiPlex GX240 with a 35 gig hard drive. So ya, it ain't a hot rod like it was when it was new but it isn't ready for the trash can yet.
  The thing is, I have never seen any program use up so much memory and
CPU doing nothing! I ran a couple of scans with it, one quick scan that didn't find anything and one complete scan that took over 24 hrs. It didn't find anything either.
  Then I ran my old SpyBot and SpywareBlaster and they both found a few things on just a quick scan. So don't waist your money on this one or your time installing it. Unless you have at least a gig or more of RAM memory don't even think about installing this and still be able to do anything else with your computer with this just running in the background. And even if you have plenty of memory, 3 or 4 gig, it still isn't worth installing. Not in my opinion anyway. There are several other programs that do better and use less and a lot of them are free.
  Overall I'm very disappointed in this program and I would not recommend it to any one."
Cool box!
"This is a good product and it does work well.  Many of the options are web based.  It could be better, but then it would likely cost more too.  This is a good software program."
"I have been waiting a long time for an update to Microsoft Office.  I primarily use a Mac and really do not like iWork (even now that it is free; I hate 'exporting' as DOC).  So I always use MS Office.  I have been using Office 2011 forever and felt really dated on my machine.  Especially when I do use Windows and use Office 2013.  I was excited to get Office 2016.

Installation was simple, I was not sure if I needed to, but to ensure a good install I followed the Microsoft KB article on removing all traces of Office 2011 before installing Office 2016.  Since the world thinks we all have time to wait for a download I downloaded Office 2016 which took about 20 minutes (it was about 1.2GB).  I thought it was not terrible but it took forever to install (1.5 hours) and it said it would only take 6.6GB so I am not sure why it took so long to install (I have a SSD Hybrid so it is not a write speed problem).  But anyway, I left it running overnight and when I woke up it was installed.

I just dragged Outlook to the trash since it is not included with this copy and no reason to waste space for something that just prompts to upgrade.  I would love it if one day Access, Publisher and Visio would be available for Mac.  But for now the only options you have is Word, Excel and PowerPoint.

The new versions are not a great UI change over the Office 2011.  I was kind of expecting a more Windows Office 2013 feel, but it is not a giant difference.  But it does seem a bit nicer than Office 2011.  The menus are all Mac like and dialogs are Mac like, so it feels more at home, but the Office 2013 version has some nice full screen screens when saving and printing which is nice; but it is not Mac like, so I guess I see why they were not brought over.

Word and Excel work as expected and I don't find much difference between 2011 and 2016.  I am experiencing some lag sometimes in Excel.  I think it is due to the animated box around the cells.  It is not a giant lag, but sometimes it is noticeable and locks the UI (beach ball).  I have a 2011 i7 MacBook Pro.

PowerPoint is nice and has some new transitions which are nice and remind me of the Keynote transitions; so I do like the new transitions, but they are not as good as the Office 2013 version; I guess Microsoft loves Windows more :)

In total I really like Office 2016, it has a nice look and feels  a bit more modern after upgrading from Office 2011. It is not as great as Office 2013, but it is better than Office 2011...  I still think there is no choice in Mac other than having Office, iWorks will never be a replacement and I cannot be expected to email .pages files to anyone and expect other than confusion...  So Office is a must for me!  I am happy with this update and highly recommend the box full version over the 365 for Office especially for Mac (since you lose a lot of the software).  And Office for iOS is free now so there is no great benefit over 365 if you are an Apple person."
"VideoStudio has some good features. However, it was better when it was still a Ulead product."
"I have an Acer computer without many bells and whistles on it.  It does have (much to my dismay) Windows 8.  Apparently VideoStudio Ultimate X8 does not like Windows 8.  Three crashes during installation made me almost give up.  Finally I managed to get it installed with a lot of help from the internet and when I opened the program it looked fine.  Very much like the other programs I have used - top right is the display of the video you are creating, top left are the tools, center is series of layers you can add - but then it crashed.  I rebooted the computer and started it up again - I could see the dashboard and - crash.

From the fleeting view I saw of this program, it appears to have the same setup as all of the others - I cannot however, get it to work on Windows 8 without crashing so I cannot attest to the speed, tools etc."
Have been away from Family Circle magazine for awhile; glad I'm back to reading it!
I have never been dissatisfied with Turbo Tax ever.
"It did a good job until it ported stock information from Quicken. It ported two copies of each transaction. Lucky I made money in the market, or seeing double the amount would have been a shock."
"This video software is a good starter, but I have used better software for video editing. I think this software is very user friendly, so if you have used windows movie maker, then you can use this with no problem. I don't think this software has any special features like other software does, so it's not confusing at all. I think this is good for your basic home movie maker that wants to throw in some titles and picture in with the video editing, so this software is pretty good for the money."
"I have loved this for years, bath and body discontinued it, never thought of looking for it online.  So glad I did"
"Smells great. I'm looking for the cologne that matches. I have the Green Tea cologne and it's a great match for the Green Tea Body Wash. I wish this product offered the same. My complaint that the scent only lasts about 4 hours is the same as that for Green Tea. If you are looking for a very fresh scent (especially if you are a guy), this is a product I recommend."
"My mother was one of the first to use a computer dictation program back in the 90s due to a medical condition.  I wish she could see how far they've come!  This Dragon Dictate for Mac is truly astonishing.  Now, I'm not comparing it to anything recent.  I'm comparing it to the voice-recognition on my smart phone and my mom's program from the 90s.  The most shocking thing about the program:  You don't have to speak slower for the software to understand you.  Once you go through the tutorial (what I'll call it), it understands you at a high rate of speed.  The main problem (and the star deduction) is for the formatting issues. It would take awhile for me to actually be able to use the program to create a professional document; it would still be faster for me to type it and format as I go.  I will use it for shorter, less complex, or informal writings."
Allows me to save files to pdf with print command.  That's all I wanted.
"I've used Norton seemingly forever so I like it, it works extremely well. Only question is why ship a key number in a package that could hold the full DVD/CD and manual?"
"In theory, 360 2.0 is a comprehensive all-in-one security package that frees the user from the need to remain cognizant of maintenance needs, especially if one has multiple PCs to be serviced, and for newer units with mid to upper range capability that is the case.

After months of ambivalence (and waiting for the supposed automatic offer), I decided to upgrade from version 1.0 to 2.0 on three computers: One desktop with 4 GB of memory with Vista Ultimate, a laptop with Vista home premium and 2GB memory, and an 8 yearold but highly reliable CPU with only 256MB memory. Version 1.0 ran adequately on the first two units and from all appearances this version 2.0 is not as resource intensive as the earlier version however, LiveUpdate remains an annoyance.

Similarly to version 1.0, it appears the only other Norton product that is compatible with 360 is Norton Ghost.

In the case of the older unit, performance of Norton 360  was consistently problematic so I was not surprised to encounter difficulties with the upgrade however I had no inkling of the extent of encumbrances I would face in what from a cursory view appeared to be a rather benign installation.

Like security suites offered by other vendors version 2.0 includes virus protection (unfortunately still updated via LiveUpdate whereas NIS 2009 is migrating to real time updating) firewall, spyware and intrusion protection, email scanning, parental controls and anti-spam filtering. The latter mentioned features are available as add-on packs accessible from Symantec's website. This version also enhances network monitoring capabilities and expands supported media for backups. Curiously, and incongruently, while network attached storage devices like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Netgear-RND2150-ReadyNAS-Duo-500-GB-Desktop-Network-Attached-Storage/dp/B0013G04AQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Netgear RND2150 ReadyNAS Duo 500 GB Desktop Network Attached Storage</a>&nbsp;are discovered by network monitoring, automatic backup to the same device is not supported. It should also be noted the only qualitative difference I can see between the standard version and the premier version of 2.0 is the increased online secure backup storage of  10GB in the case of the premier edition. Standard edition availability is 2GB and in my opinion neither is sufficient. As an all in one product, some compromises in user control could be anticipated however it would have been an advantage if the user was offered the capability to backup individual files rather than continuing the limitation to classes of folders. Essentially, while backup to ipods is intriguing, I see little advantage to employing this backup facility over the functionality existent in both XP and Vista operating systems.

The network monitoring feature is beneficial but is flawed to the extent multiple devices connected to a single access point  like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NETGEAR-HD-Gaming-5-GHz-Wireless-N-Networking-Kit-WNHDEB111/dp/B00126R3P6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NETGEAR HD/Gaming 5 GHz Wireless-N Networking Kit (WNHDEB111)</a>&nbsp;are not individually distinguishable. Only the mac address of the access point is identified therefore from my primary computer I cannot fully monitor a second PC or my NAS.

This version also includes registry cleaning as a component of the PC tune-up facility and ""identity safe security"" of personal information like social security, bank account and credit card numbers. The phishing filter is an improvement over version 1.0 however it still lacks the comprehensiveness of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/McAfee-Site-Advisor-Plus-2009-1-User/dp/B001EJQTUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">McAfee Site Advisor Plus 2009 1-User</a>&nbsp;in as much as it does not offer advice search engine results. Significantly, the phishing filter does not work with Safari or Google chrome.

And then there was the upgrade on my older PC...

In spite of Norton's representations, I would not recommend installation on any PC that meets only minimum system requirements. At every step, I encountered difficulties that severely constrained the process and after 24 man hours devoted to installation the process is still incomplete.

First and foremost, upgrade is not automatic. Although 360 offers three PC licensing, I could not download the upgrade via my existing account. Only after email inquiry was I provided  an address that facilitated download to my second and third PCs. In the instance of my oldest unit I made the mistake of running the recommended system scan before installation. It occurred to me as well, this does not generate a great deal of confidence in Norton if in fact one is upgrading or replacing an existing Norton anti-virus program. I received a message indicating this version was incompatible with Windows Defender so I had to remove that program before proceeding. I did not pre-scan with the other two PCs and no compatibility issues were identified nor I have experienced any since the upgrade or have I ever encountered issues in the two years I used 360 version 1.0.

Although during install procedure on my first computer I was advised existing add-on packs should be backed up using another program that must be downloaded from the Norton site, the same message was not received for either of the later installs and the add-on pack itself appeared on my desktop upon completion of the preliminary stages, but I get ahead of myself. The install aborted three times because LiveUpdate was running in the background and could not be terminated even manually via msconfig or the task manager. When I finally managed to disable it, I later discovered another version initiated by Norton Ghost could not be removed, so I had to uninstall Ghost before proceeding. Degradation of system performance was clearly evident as at least five hard stops were required and in each case the difference in boot times was visually perceptible without Norton running. Eventually, the install was completed but start up would not progress past the call to explorer.exe which was visible but the desktop icons were never painted...another hard stop via task manager and restart.

Finally, the configuration wizard appeared and I was able to setup the program...only to discover Norton had identified un-removable cookies,an un-repairable virus and my virus definitions from version 1.0 had not updated via LiveUpdate for more than 8 months. Following program instructions to contact online support for more information, I reached site catch 22 as the more information could not be gleaned until I defined the problem inhibiting installation...After removing the cookies with spybot and determining the virus was most likely Norton Ghost LiveUpdate, and  running a new version of LiveUpdate for more than two hours to acquire all of the missed updates, I received an email from support advising I should download a software removal tool to wipe out any residue programs, which of course would also wipe out my latest install and render 14 hours of effort pointless.

So now, I have version 2.0 installed and running with significantly greater degradation than version 1.0 as it applies to response time for Explorer or Firefox so I'm using Safari as the default browser and it performs with blazing speed even on this under resourced box with Norton installed. Of course...my install of Microsoft Office suite has been damaged so I have time to type this on another computer while I wait for the re-install to finish..."
I guess it works
"I've been using Pinnacle software for years and upgraded to Avid Studio after Avid purchased Pinnacle.  Now Corel owns Pinnacle and this product is an upgraded version of Avid Studio.

However, if you have a problem, you'll run into is a maze of technical incompetence. Corel promotion pages that say something will work and it does not. This is misrepresentation.

Plus the PDF help files that come with the Corel Studio 16 Ultimate install point to dead end broken links. Ergo, absolutely no quality assurance.  This is a slam bam thank you mam release.

But support is the real nightmare. It's like who's on first via email. No phone support whatsoever.  At least when Avid owned the line, you could talk to someone live instead of emails with techs who don't bother to read your message carefully.

Corel did a horrible sloppy roll out on this product. It will them a long time to sort this nonsense out - if ever.  Don't come near this product until 2014 or later."
"My computer at work has windows XP installed on it, and just from navigating around it I am so glad, that I did not waste my money installing it on my home PC.
The only good thing about this OS is that its ""pretty"".  It LOOKS a lot better than windows 2000 and other previous versions, and also it seems to load a lot faster than windows 2000. Which warrants my 2 star rating.
The new set up in Windows XP is very cumbersome and sometimes downright confusing.  For those of us that are familiar with Win 2K you will find that many things are not in places where we are used to them being.  This is a small problem and im sure that I will become comfortable with it.  My main gripe is the constant application lock ups in this OS for no apparant reason.  For example if you happen to mistype a URL in Internet Explorer, then be prepared to have IE lock up for at least 45 seconds before windows decides to allow you to control IE again.  Same goes true for Outlook.  Sometimes Outlook will just lock up for no reason and either you have to wait it out, or just do a control-ALT-Delete to end the task which is believe it or not a lot quicker than waiting on windows.  Keep in mind my inbox only has 20 messages since I just started my job Monday.  Yet it still locks up and crashes for no reason.  To add fuel to the fire sometimes applications will just terminate with fatal errors and come up with a message box stating ""sorry for the inconvience"" and an option to send the error report to microsoft. HA!  It looks like Microsoft expected this OS to have a lot of problems (and that it does) and are using the customers to find all their bugs for them.  I wouldn't mind doing this for a pay check, but for free?  I don't think so.
I've only used XP for 4 days and already having a multitude of problems with constant lock ups and crashes.  I haven't had the oppurtunity to do software installations on this OS, and frankly I don't want to, im sure that is also littered with bugs.  As much as I hated windows ME, I think I am beginning to hate XP even more.
If you have 2000, then stick with it, don't waste your money on XP."
"Symantec's 360 has a surprisingly excellent product in version two of this made for home use item. The product integrates very well with Office 2007 ( the Full Enterprise Version , as well as lesser  types).With the full MS Office and Norton 360 to be installed,two reboots is common. Norton 360 covers PC Security, Identity Protection,Backup and PC Tuneup in broad terms. When errors in install occur, a reinstall utility covers and easily fixes problems. The setup shuts down Ghost until install is complete, and also until the backup setup is decided upon since 360 has its own backup technique. After initial setup, the configuration is pretty much automatic. All items are set up on what seems to be a standard basis, with the exception of the backup routine, which is something that can be turned on or off ( unlike the other three major sections) so that you can use the Norton GHOST backup should you want to do so. Its an impressive piece of software, great price, installs and operates extremely well.
For a family machine with a non-technical or partially technical background, this is a great piece of software that operates well, and operates automatically. It fits a niche market, and does not , as some say, cross over into some of the regular Norton areas; especially since it is simple and easy to use."
I was very concerned that this product apparently changes all the defaults without an option to refuse.  I therefore choose to install on my older computer.  It isn't that old in that it runs Windows 7... but it has slowed down considerably which is why I upgraded...  So keep that in mind that this may not apply to you..  but it crashed on install and I couldn't use the product.  I would try it on my newer computer but I am reluctant to have all my defaults changed.
Very well written and produced tutorial on Quicken 2015. I recommend the book to whoever needs this edition.
"My quibble is with the Business section, as it is really limited business.  A competing product includes forms like 1065 which a family partnership would need.  This leaves the product incomplete, and I feel Intuit is being disingenuous in their representation of the product."
"Ive used Turbo Tax for the 3 previous years & will use it this year as well. I don't have alot of deductions, or any children & Im single but I 'aint' the sharpest knife in the drawer & Im kinda math stupid. So in the past Ive always be a little apprehensive when I mail my returns.

I also moved 3 years ago from a state with no state taxes to a state that does collect taxes. Alot of taxes! That along with the fact that Im making more money (curse this G.W.Bush economy!) & have a larger 401K, a substantial high interest savings account & a another investment on the side, I feel the need to get the most I can out of my taxes & reporting of same.

My taxes are fairly straight forward ( I think!? ) & with some effort I could go back to doing them again. But I have made mistakes doing my taxes  in the past & Turbo Tax ( so far ) has not. I feel confidant using Turbo Tax & that alone is worth the price of admission.

As far as the e filing, I don't use it. Thankfully, Im in a position where I can wait for my check. If I got it right away it wouldnt make any difference in my quality of life so the expense is just a waste for me.

Also, I didn't read it here but while at Staples last night I saw something about getting a free year of credit monitoring from Experian when you purchase the deluxe model. NOW, how much would you pay!? ;P"
Unexpectedly good. The best smelling shower gel I have ever used. A little bit on the sweet side. But not chemical
Interesting articles.
"I bought Parallels 8 for my 2012 MacBook and have used it with Windows 7 for over two years. It has allowed me to stop using  my other PCs for day to day tasks and run Windows applications on Apple Macs without having to reboot my Mac or install a dual OS. I have never had a problem and recently upgraded to Parallels 10 prior to updating my machine to OS X Yosemite.

It is an excellent product and I have never been more happy."
"Is you are coming back to the Corel Draw world because the Adobe Illustrator ""cloud"" software license ticked you off, we are here for the same reason. I used Corel Draw years ago but over time Illustrator became my primary vector tool. Their aren't many decent options for drawing Vector art and I;m glad that Corel has continued to improve their product. I'm quite impressed with version 7. The tabbed interface is responsive and easy to navigate.  They have multiple standard layouts like Illustrator too (Lite, Classic, Default, Illustration and Page Layout). The sheer amount of new features that Corel has added to bring Corel Draw within striking range of Adobe is extremely impressive."
"I appreciated the sniping tool in Vista -- but I hated Vista so much I reinstalled XP.  So I missed the sniping tool and Googled for a solution and found Snag It!  Snag It! is far, far superior to the simpleton tool Microsoft had (SURPRISE.

I whole heartly recommend this if you need to send screen shots with comments."
"I read some had issues with the key after buying as a download so this was ordered.  It arrived quickly, installed easily, and updated as expected.  I've used this product for several tax years now and it's way better than the competitors product which I abandoned after getting what they call ""service."""
Some installation issues but corrected by Symantec Support.
"When you get started and you eard of lightroom and did not know how to go around with (LR is very complex) you might start to look around for something that does the same thing. Or if you have enough of LR. There is a nice tutorial with a pro out there. If you are the kind to do just a couple of adjustment like contrast, sharpening and exposure, you don't need LR. ASP do that and more. It does not do everything LR does, like if you are a die had vignetting, they have it. But right now there is no white vignetting. But there is alway's a work around, you can export your picture into something like Photoshop elements or Paintshop Pro. Many users can be just happy with it, but did not eard of Aftershoot pro. It's still a young software, but they listen their customers. If you don't want to invest 10$ per month for Lightroom photoshop all your life, get into ASP. I don'T know about the raw conversion, even on Lightroom not everybody is happy about it. I shoot JPG.
ASP have presets also. Some tools are incomplete like Cropping. But some tools are faster to use than LR in the cropping. I am all about cropping, I think LR is incomplete, I would eventually create my own crop tool as plugin for ASP and would be happy with it. You can actually have a programmer making plugins for you to do what you want with a software like ASP, but people don't think about it."
Whats not to love about a gift card?
"I purchased this program for works my pictures.
Pros:
1) graphical interface is nice.
2) The tool very similar photoshop cs5
3)The tool level is wonderfull
4) The tool fix efects is good.
Cons
1) Very slowly
I recomended only light works"
"I have used TurboTax for 10 years and would not consider filing a return without it. It makes an unpleasant but necessary job tolerable,"
"Love Cracker Barrel and especially gift cards. It's a great country food type of place to eat.
Every one that I have been to has great service, great food and the gift card makes paying so much faster."
I love I can save TurboTax download in Amazon Software Library and not have to keep track of a disc or worry about having to reinstall if my computer crashes.
"I have been using MS Office professional for decades. This latest version simply provides the top version in the most convenient, automatically updated, and economical format. The annual subscription renews the app on all 5 machines for a year, for under $100 ($20 per year per PC or device). I have had a number of scary moments with the Outlook component, but each was quickly fixed by the readily-available Microsoft telephone service for this product (I let them take over my machine and they quickly fix it in less than 10 minutes). Frankly, this telephone service deserves more than five stars--competing at a near-perfect level, despite competing support elsewhere in the software market being scandalously poor."
"I have a Dell laptop (core duo) with MS WP installed and Norton Internet Security 2006.  No problems whatsoever with NIS 2006.

Usually I have a if it ain't broke, don't fix it philosophy but decided to see if there were any updates/downloads.  I went to the Symantec download sight.  They said I was eligible for an update. I  thought it would be an update to NIS 2006 but instead ended up getting and update to NIS 2008.

Installation took a while for this speedy laptop (like 10-15minutes).  It went flawlessly and i have been running on it for an hour with no problems.  I was not expecting a
free update.  Maybe it is because of past problems with NIS 2006.  The info just said i was eligible for an update with my current subscription.

I have been buying Dell pc's since day one and they all come with some sort of Norton software.  To date I have not experienced the nightmares that some people have written about except for some ordering problems for some software that never came and it took many calls to get the problem resolved.

So far I have not noticed any degradation in boot time or performance.  Like I said, the new software has only been running for a hour or so.  My rating would be 4 stars for now only because there has not been a lot of run time.

This is an update to my previous review above.  I would rate this product a one star as when i powered down my laptop and then restarted my PC blue screened.  Yes it did.  I called Dell and was able to restore my machine to the original image.  It took me 8 hours more to get my pc back to where I had it before the crash as I reinstalled new software I purchased and had to download all the XP security updates."
"VMWare works flawlessly.  It lets me run Windows 7 programs on my Mac, just like I would run any other Mac program.  No more need to reboot my computer to switch operating systems like I would have to do previously.  And no need to jump back and forth between computers during my workday.  This saves me time and increased my productivity.

This is a truly spectacular programs.  Anyone who uses both Windows and Mac would benefit from VMWare.  It would behoove Apple to add a program like this in their future OS versions."
"I started to install this on my new laptop but it already has the new Norton 360 on it. Some programs will work together but this one wants to be the ONLY security program on the computer. My old Norton had expired on my old Dell desk top so I thought I'd try this on it.

  First I had to remove Norton and Norton's utilities and I didn't really like that. Then I had to remove the McAfee site advisor and SpyWareBlaster, all before the install would run.

  After I finally got it installed I don't know how well it will work since I cant get my computer to run at all. I've tried booting it up several times. It will give me my desktop and short cuts but everything is locked up. I haven't had time to try a safe start and see if I can do anything with it. I might have to take it to my computer guy to get it going again.

  The only other thing I got to say is that I'm glad that I didn't put it in my new laptop. I've got too much important data in this one to loose it. At least by trying it in my old desktop first it saved my laptop.

Update; I finally got my desktop computer that I installed this in to boot up. I don't know where this program went but it isn't there and when I tried to install it again the install was stopped. It said that the one installation that was allowed from this disc had already been used. All that I can say about it now is that I'm sure glad that I didn't have to pay for this because I would be very upset about it if I had and I would be demanding my money back."
"We have quite a number of PCs in our home. Between laptops for remote use, PCs for work and then devices for gaming, it seems like there's a lot of opportunity for viruses to get into our network. I like the idea of having a 10 device set with just a single purchase, rather than having to buy individual protection for each PC on its own.

One downside is that the moment you activate the first one, the timer begins. So then you're impelled to race around and get the rest installed so they all get the full benefit of the full time period. If one of them happens to still have 3 months left from another software package, you're out of luck. And if you wait for that one to be ready, now you've left other machines unprotected in the meantime. So that's a bit of the pain, to get them all synced at the beginning.

I'm a bit unimpressed with their mobile offerings. They're not really doing much at all on the mobile end - and they count as a full ""machine"". I would rather they said 10 full PC / laptop installs plus toss in a phone or two as an added benefit. Maybe if you start adding more than that you could count them as a half - or something - but to have them be an entire PC's worth of protection doesn't make sense.

Still, I've always loved Norton from its earliest days and find them to be reliable and secure. I use my machines for work and it would take me a while to recover from a serious virus attack. So this is something I take seriously and want to ensure I have solid protection. I've never had an issue with Norton, and so far I haven't had any problems with this software either."
"Once again those monopolistic marketing weasels at M$ are trying to pull a fast one.

One-time purchase for life of PC.

What this means is,if you buy for your older system and say in a year or two you upgrade because it broke or was stolen,you can't reinstall it because it is locked to the original hardware.

M$ wants to force you into a subscription model now.

As the saying goes ,a rat is a rat is a rat.

This monopoly should have been busted up when they had the chance!"
"I like turbo tax because it is easy, ecconimical and accurate.  I like it because you can import data from last year's returns and from your other financial programs such as quicken.  The questions make it easy for the begginner or the pro to get the right decuctions.  It is like walking you through the whole return.

What I do not like is that if you do not have the internet, you still have to call for an update disc.  The other change is that you have to call for you State disc also.  This causes undo delay in filing your return.  In past editions, you always recieved the all of the states you when you bought the deluxe edition.

Do not worry if you have the internet though, you can just download the updates and state returns.

I would have given this 3 1/2 stars if I could.  Intuit still has more work to do."
"but....if I copy something off the interent and I want to paste it in Word or Excel, it won't just post the text I need, but to it will try to paste a carbon copy of the webpage, which stalls the applications on my laptop.

Otherwise, I haven't had any issues with the software."
"There is no false adverstising with Rosetta Stone. This system works, but one caveat. It takes a lot of time. You need to listen to the lessons and do nothing else.  If you are trying to become fairly fluent for a vacation or business trip, this is the way to go. But, if you really want to learn the language, with conjugations and such then you still need a class or workbook. Also be careful, this is Latin American Spanish, not Spanish from Spain. There is a difference."
"Installation:
= For a trouble-free installation, completely un-install any competing products first
= Also, un-install any other Mcafee products you have installed, it will not remove them as promised but it will choke on them.
= Shut all other programs down during install, you will need to restart your PC upon completion.
= Mcafee will check your computer for viruses
= We installed on Win 7 and XP with no issues

What Works:
+ Doesn't noticeably slow down computer
+ Lots of features: Anti-virus, anti-spy, anti-phishing, website safety ratings, etc
+ Catches viruses in email before you open it
+ Intuitive interface
+ 3 users - everyone in the family can use the same product

What Could Be Better:
- I didn't have to call tech support but I have friends who use this product also and say that it is awful.
- Mcafee will verify your Windows license (my license is valid, but I don't see how this is any of Mcafee's business...)

Good things to know:
= If you give Mcafee your credit card number, it will auto renew the license every year unless you can figure out how to cancel - 30 days before your subscription expires.
= If Mcafee seems to be slow, you can go into settings and turn off some of the RAM-hogging features."
Don't use it
"I thought this was fake. But the key is now under the scratch off and be careful. Its also so darn small once you get it scratched off you'll have to put it under a magnified light to read it. Scratch lightly because P's look like F's ETC. Microsoft needs to get their heads out. Amazon should raise hell with Microsoft about this, because even when the key code was not under a scratch off, it was so tiny it had to be magnified. What the hell are they trying to do sell a product you can't use. I understand security, but this is moronic!!"
"It does everything that I want it to do, and is easy to set up and operate without multiple trips to the help files."
"...then this would be it.

I'm not being deregatory about it, but if you're looking for something to simply pick up and go and don't have a Photoshop background, this is definitely up your alley.

Installation was a breeze along with the obligatory entering of an umpteenth million set of a serial code to unlock the software.  Thankfully, the unlock key is easy to read and kind to most eyes (no ""5""s that looks like a ""S"", for example).

Your Library will be host to your collection of photos.  However, what truly impressed me was the Adjustments menu.  Here you have a full suite of controlling multiple color values.  However, the true fun for me was looking at the wealth of presets that were available and there are even more you can download...I clicked through each one and although there are a fair number that you won't ever touch, there's something for everyone especially if you're prone to artistic flair.

The Edit menu is definitely targeted for those who ""don't like how they look in pictures.""  Filters like skin smootheners, wrinkle removers, and even...*gasp* a body shaper are amongst the tools available, although these are simply ""on the nose"" names for many tools that you would label as ""distortions"" in the Photoshop world.  That said, they're definitely labeled for the casual user in mind and you don't have to scratch your head over cryptic icons to find what you need.

There are also Slideshow tools that you can produce and even share on Youtube.  Print, as simple as it sounds, is a a tool that gives you the ability to print multiple photos on a page and gives you far better control than Windows does with their poor photo printing tool.

My only complaint is that, unlike Photoshop Elements, I didn't find an easy way to adjust an entire group of photos.  One of the things that I liked about Photoshop Elements was being able to select tools like sharpen, remove red eye, and color balance and apply it to an entire folder where it would then open, alter, then save photos on the fly without having to resort to opening each one individually.  I didn't find it in the help menu, but if I'm in error, please let me know and I'll correct my review.

That said, this is a pretty worthy tool suite and you can't beat it for the price, especially if you're a casual photographer...recommended!"
"This product has so many features that suit the beginner and the professional home designer. There are thousands of configurations to play with to find the ones that suit your tastes. There is practically unlimited uses for this software and I really enjoyed playing around with many of the settings and dreaming up new combinations.

There are design capabilities for both indoors and outdoors allowing you to truly complete your dream home on paper before making it a reality."
"I found everything about doing my (as well as my kids) returns to be easy and intuitive using this software. It is better than TaxCut (which abandoned Mac anyhow) and I think better than the professional software I used working part time at a private tax prep place. I agree with one other reviewer--not too happy with the price hike AND loss of the discount coupons. Guess they figure they've got us hooked and don't need those promos. One downside with the 2005 TurboTax--I had printing problems with my Mac and a quirky HP all-in-one printer. Eventually found a work-around, but it was a hassle. On the TurboTax help website I determined that many others were in the same boat, as were some Windows users. My work-around eventually came from another user, not the techs at TurboTax who posted rather generic responses to specific questions. Haven't gotten that far along with taxes this year--hope they have resolved the printing problems."
"Great product, I had no issues and love the way it smelled and how it made my skin feel."
"If not for the ""Metro"" interface and start menu(or lack therof), Windows 8 would be an upgrade to Windows 7.  The fact that it does have Metro and does NOT have a start menu, keeps me from giving it 3 stars.  To get the same functionality, I have to install third party software and re-purchase DVD functionality and Media Center, which I already had before...and used.  In desktop mode (funny because it's a desktop anyway), the interface is a lot smoother.  I've noticed that they made some real improvements with network connectivity on the Xbox 360.  Whenever I wanted to listen to music from my Xbox to my home stereo using Win 7, it would only connect about half the time, making it unreliable.  With Windows 8, the connection is virtually 100%.  Of course, Microsoft overdid it and, my xbox imports all my file folders too, which gives me a big mess of empty folders it can't read.  With all the sophistication of the Xbox, you still rely on folders...really?

Regarding the Metro interface, it's a good tablet OS, but why on earth would you bolt a tablet interface to an OS designed for a desktop??  It's just plain stupid!  Oh yeah, take away the start button...and menu, then put settings and folders in places where no one can find them unless they navigate through a tablet interface with their mouse and keyboard.  Fortunately, there are third party programs like ""Classic Shell"" that adds a start menu and boots straight to the desktop.  For most people, they would be wondering if this is some kind of Halloween prank.

When I have software like DVD playback working, then take it away when I pay for an upgrade, then make me purchase it again as an add-on feature, it's not much of an upgrade, is it?  In fact, that's a downgrade that I just paid for!

Another issue is UEFI.  Basically, Microsoft takes control of your bootloader with the installation of Windows.  This had nothing to do with security.  It was Microsoft's way of locking-out Linux by encrypting the bootloader to anything except Windows 8.  Ethics will always be in debate.  Apple does the exact same thing, but at least it locks the computer into good software.  Apple also designs the hardware, so it has an interest in protecting hardware integrety.  Microsoft is a software vendor, so they do not design any of the hardware it runs on, so the only other reason would be to lock out another OS.

As a desktop, it's surprisingly stable.  It has all the good qualities of Win 7 with better connectivity and plug & play support.  Unfortunately it doesn't have much more than that because Microsoft spent so much time and money on Metro.  Security is as poor as ever, so I rely on Norton.  All in all, had it not been for the fact I can get this version for free from my university, I never would have upgraded.  For most people, it's not an upgrade."
"PaintShop Photo Pro X3 does have some of the best photo correction and editing tools, some right up there with Adobe Photoshop (which I also use), but the new interface and ease of use took a serious step backward from the X2 release.

Right out of the box, I had problems with the program. First with the actual installation, which failed on my Vista Laptop, and then with recognizing my TWAIN enabled scanner. I was eventually able to work through these issues but know that few people would have stuck with it as long as I did if returning it was an option.

Once installed, and some time taken to master the navigation and learn the tools, the program is a very good photo editing package. The ""Smart Carver"" is a very cool tool for removing unwanted objects in pictures and it usually works fairly well. I also enjoyed playing the included 24 KPT filters and will likely find a use for a few of them making promotional materials for my wife's small business.

This is not the best release of Paintshop and I hope Corel address all of the user complaints found in the reviews before the next release!

CFH"
Okay miss the old style TV guide won't buy again
"Works with Windows 7 and 8 and XP, and for 3 PC, will be the last time we see this and the only reason we bought it now, just to have Word and Excel before it became a 1 PC or yearly subscription."
"Installation on my desktop running Windows 7 went very smoothly (took about 15 minutes from start to finish) and I found the software to be surprisingly snappy when processing videos.

But I need to back up a moment and mention that although I spend a great deal of time working on graphics, I'm new to video editing (aside from some tutorial and review videos I did using TechSmith's Camtasia) and this software has a serious learning curve. I would actually recommend the first thing a new user do is download the documentation (which is surprisingly thorough and actually helpful) from the Corel website and read it. But be warned, it's massive.

Moving along, I've mainly been using this software to create relatively short movies (longest being about 15 minutes) geared toward teaching/reviewing and have found them to compile/render quickly (less than 30 minutes apiece). And the software sports and amazing number of features, but I'm absolutely in love with its subtitle feature. It's a little scary how easy they are to add and the software detects where the sound clips are so you don't need to manually queue up the subtitles to speech--that was an absolute joy for me. Overall I enjoy using this software and find myself opening it far more than Casmtasia when I need to edit a video.

Now I would be remiss if I didn't mention that privacy junkies should be certain to completely read the licensing agreement because it grants Corel the right to collect certain data (along with potentially personally identifiable information) through use of the software. And it also states that the software can only be installed on a single machine and in the event you need to install it on another machine should your hard disk fail (it seems that's the only scenario in which you'd be allowed to reinstall the software on another computer) you must *call* Corel's customer service for permission to do so...this could cramp the style of a multi-computer household, and at least Apple gives you the ability to deregister a computer via its website."
This magazine is very nice and has a lot of good information and tips. It is entertaining and fun to read.
"Every year I go out and by Turbo Tax for the convenience and that I can down load the information with ease from my quicken program.  This is a big plus in the programming and it's only benefit.  But I always wind up doing it by hand anyway.

In years past, turbo tax was issued and then a follow up final issue with all the information was added so if you waited until April, you would be assured to have the final version which allowed you to print and do your state taxes.  Unfortunately, this is no longer the case.  You have to go online to get the final versions.  What if you do not have online access?  Well then you have you have to call them and are not guaranteed to get any help that way.  The headache is not worth it..

Since the IRS puts all of its final laws into place in June, can't turbo tax and other software put out there final versions by December 1?  Since we are forced to pay taxes every year, shouldn't this be as complete as possible BEFORE they release it?  This way all we need is one program and not worried about getting on line or worried about new product information.

Consider other options until they fix this part of the programming."
"Not much substance.  i won't be renewing.  But truth be told, i'm not a mother so much of the stuff just doesn't relate to me and there seems to be a lot of medical and drug ads that I am not a fan of."
great buy
"Quicken 2014 is full of bugs.

In addition, if you wish to run an update you must first log into Intuit website first. It is not enough to know your bank accounts password, first you have to get intuits permission to access your bank.

This is a self serving economic ploy by intuit to keep you tied them.

It used to be a great program."
Good weight lifting/workout tips!
"Have used this for over a month and I love it! No more itching or burning of my skin. Along with the Olay Age Defying moisturizer, my skin feels smooth and non-greasy. Lovely light scent too."
Bought for my 2013 return.  I like how easy turbo tax is.
"Microsoft has a whole set of suites that deal with maps.  The lowest level is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Streets-Trips-2010-with-GPS/dp/B0017KEA6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Streets & Trips 2010 with GPS</a>.  There are versions with GPS and others without.

Mappoint is more though, Mappoint is designed with the business user in mind.  You can integrate Mappoint with Microsoft Office and Access databases and use it to create beautiful business map graphics that are based on geography and then import them into powerpoint.  If you're a business user developing marketing plans, analyzing markets, deciding where to put your next franchise, Mappoint is a great tool to help you with that.

I have to admit that I've been a Mappoint user since the product first came out and back then it cost upwards of $1,000 but that price has been dropping.  I think this is predominantly based on competition from online cloud tools like googlemaps and mapquest.  The biggest change is that some of the buttons have been changed to give it a more user friendly look and feel to it (the layout is less cryptic than before) and it has more options for data visualization.

However, when it comes to doing business analysis, Mappoint is still a superior product because you're working with the data locally: local maps, local software, and local databases which allows you to model and run through versions much faster.  You also don't have to deal with the internet and whether the online application will be available or not.

At its current price point, I highly recommend this product for the small business or small franchise that is analysing data or for marketing professionals.  You will be rewarded with much faster performance.

INSTALLATION:
took about 7 minutes and installed fully to my machine so I don't need to keep a DVD in my machine - which is great.

COMPARISON TO GOOGLE MAPS
This does everything that google maps does but offers more customization and because it's all on your computer, it's faster and you don't have to have an internet connection.

MAPS:
The maps give you:
- regular street view
- terrain view
- night view
- political view
- and you can customize with whatever data you want to integrate with
- there is no satellite view that I could find (I'm still digging though)

STREETS AND TRIPS OR THIS
This has all the functionality of streets and trips but adds the data integration component.  If you're a business professional on the road a lot then this product can be your streets and trips (you can integrate a GPS into it) + you get the ability to integrate data into it to create your presentations without having to connect to the web.  If you're just looking for a trip planning software, try&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Streets-Trips-2010-with-GPS/dp/B0017KEA6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Streets & Trips 2010 with GPS</a>&nbsp;which gives you standalone mapping and GPS.

ADDITIONAL MAPS
This version comes with North American detailed maps.  If you're doing business modeling for Asia, Europe, South America etc, Microsoft sells additional maps for those regions.  Visit the Microsoft site for those.  I've only ever used the US and Europe versions so beyond that can't comment."
"The scent is very unique and luxurious. Very Euro...it combines the cleanness of modern scents with something ancient. I bought it for my husband, but i secretly love it for myself. I wish I had the cologne, but it cant be shipped to my FPO address."
"Being only mildly interested in geneology I do not want an overly complicated piece of software, but I would like it to be flexible enough to be more than just a family tree builder.  Family Tree Maker definitely fits the bill. It was easy to install and allows me to create multiple family trees (which allows the kids to play around on this).  I love the ability to attach files and documents to the tree.  This allows us to tell a story of each person.  All the options this program gives has definitely increased my interest in geneology.  I am looking forward to the whole family participating in creating our tree."
"But the articles generally were disappointing, so I decided to just read it at the bookstore whenever a decent article appeared. Saving money and trees."
"We enjoy review the different recipes, food reviews and new items shown in the magazine.  There is a variety of items to review."
"This is relatively light reading. Don't expect detailed plans for how to implement any of the ideas shown. However, I usually get at least a couple good ideas of out each issue. I prefer this magazine to Martha Stewart Living, which is more food-focused. Don't get me wrong - there are still plenty of food recipes in each issue of Country Living. However, it's a nice balance between articles on food, decor, DIY/crafts, flowers, and entertaining.

UPDATE: I used to look forward to receiving my issues in the mail. However, the magazine seems to be going in a new direction. One part of that is focusing more on older items, such as expensive vintage items I could never afford to buy. Another part is focusing on rustic items with patina, but to me, the items just look rusty and neglected. Those gruff items are pricey too. I don't want to fill my home with a bunch of nonsense items. That includes the nature-inspired items such as taxidermy. I'm not sure what is going on with this magazine to be honest. It's still somewhat enjoyable to read, but I may not renew my subscription."
"Couple of key things when looking at software. First, how does it run. The best features or potential in the world are useless if the program is buggy or frustrating.  Corel runs great.  It loads quick, a fair bit quicker than Adobe Illustrator (and other Adobe programs), and runs fine on even older computers.  It's a cleaner program, it seems.  Yet, it's also feature rich.  While AI and the Adobe suite are considered industry standard, that is increasingly more tradition and habit than a reflection of capability.  I'd go as far to say that for Windows users Corel is a step ahead of Adobe, both because it connects fluidly with Visual Studio for application development and OneDrive for cloud storage, and because it offers a purchasable product rather than a rental. Adobe, after all, has moved fully into the subscription mode, so that you have access as long as you pay a fee. Sure you get upgrades but you also pour constant money into Adobe's coffers, with nothing of your own.

CorelDRAW comes in a box, with a disc.  You buy it, it's yours.  You can work online if you want, or offline as long as you want.  It's not constantly nagging you for upgrades. It's a well-designed software package that is primarily about design, with accompanying support programs, like photo-paint, which make for a unified suite that will serve almost any purpose. If you're new to design software, I'd heartily recommend Corel because of this, unless of course you're in a company or profession that demands you toe the Adobe line.  Not to say Adobe is bad, it's great, but it's strengths no longer, in my opinion, outweigh its frustrations and liabilities.  Indeed, I have a 1 year subscription with the Adobe suite already (primarily for its web design capabilities, which Corel doesn't come close to matching)

CorelDRAW is setup for the new user, facilitating pros but giving a lot of guidance and tutorials for those new to the program.  If you're not already comfortable with AI or another program, are looking for a job in the design industry, and want to have a program that you own, that's yours, that has high quality features and capabilities while running smoothly, then Corel is the way to go."
"I liked the older versions. This new version is not flexible enough. This review process is not cool. I don't like it at all. In fact, I believe that I will look for another package which would suite my need."
"Quicken (and its Quickbooks sibling) are the packages that pretty much single-handedly eliminated the accounting application software business for small to medium sized businesses, and brought easy management of financials into the realm of the personal computer.

If you're not a Quicken user then this is a great place to start.

If you are a quicken user, then as others have said this version is incremental rather than revolutionary, and sometimes it feels like the furniture is just being re-arranged to make it feel like a new house even though there's not really that much that's new.

Quicken makes it easy to do all those record keeping, tax planning, budgeting, and other tasks that you know you need to do, and you keep telling yourself you're going to get around to. It pretty much takes your hand and leads you thought the process, even if you don't know anything about accounting.

"Installed this on my home server system (Dell Dimensions AMD X2-6000 with XP Media Center with 2GB RAM / 1TB HD).  I followed all the directions carefully by having previous antiviral software removed and rebooted.  Then proceeded with the install of this product.  The install went smoothly and almost finished.  Then I assume the program started and my system rebooted (I've disabled blue screens for reboots).  I thought okay, should be fine on the reboot.  Well the system rebooted and windows started loading but then it would reach a point where the system errored again and reboot.  Pattern was infinite, I powered down and powered back on with the same pattern.

Omigod I thought, this is terrible.  Apparently this program is causing a catastrophic error to the point I can't even get windows to complete loading.  So I decide it's best to boot into safemode to remove the program.  Should be easy.  Got into safemode and loaded the uninstall control panel.  Clicked to uninstall.  Wouldn't let me.  It tells me this particular vendor's installer cannot be uninstalled under safe mode. Ridiculous!  What kind of idiot makes an installer do this?  I kept trying to no avail.  I was starting to panic thinking my system was hosed by this commercial virus (that's what a virus does).  Fortunately, I was able to roll back to the last known good configuration which prevented this program from loading.

Horrible installer for this program.  Haven't seen anything like this in ages and to think this is commercial software?  Crazy.  My home server is very stable by the way, with minimal software and runs without fault for weeks, even months at a time.  I refuse to go through this pattern of insanity, plus wasting hours of my time, just to install it on another PC to see how it works.  Beware."
"There is so much that you can simply say about computers and tablets. We do have all different ways of getting connected with others. But if there is honestly one thing that we do still have to have as a constant is protecting our devices with security software. But which ones you buy, will determine the overall longevity of a computer. There are just so many different ones. But ones that do not cost anything, do not give you the best in value, and just do more harm overall. When I had heard about Avast anti-virus software, I was absolutely concerned to know whether it would hold up with great brands like Norton and Bitdefender. Honestly the free anti-virus software does no good. It actually can scan and try to protect the computer, but honestly the spyware stays in the computer, and doesn't do a hard job in the way that others do at getting the hackers out, and staying out. Overall, I would definitely pass up this anti-virus software from Avast and go find something that definitely does the job at keeping your computer clean.

"The new Chief Architect Home Designer Architectural 10 program arrived yesterday and impressed me a LOT more than I expected. I've looked at several such programs over the years, and found most of them useless - or at least not useful to me. I've also used real computer-aided design programs, and found them powerful, but with a learning curve far too steep for my infrequent use. The Chief product, on the other hand, seems flexible and capable, yet easy to learn and use, including videos, help tutorials, a Web site that includes a user community, and automatic checks for updates.

My immediate need is to replace the LandDesigner for Windows 3.1 program I've used for almost two decades because I never found anything better for keeping track of what's planted where in our yard. Sadly, our new 64 bit Windows 7 PC is unable to run Land Designer at all, though it still works on the 32 bit version of Windows 7.

However, now that I have the Chief program, and see all it can do, I find myself wanting to map not just our yard but our entire house and deck into it, and perhaps map out a long-discussed bathroom remodeling project. This version includes pretty much anything a homeowner could want: home design, interior design, deck and landscaping design, and even such features as 3D camera views and video walk-throughs.

Installation went well, even though the 1.8 GHz Atom D525 CPU on our new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Acer-AspireRevo-AR3700-U3002-Slim-and-Compact-Desktop-Blue/dp/B00433SP6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Acer AspireRevo AR3700-U3002 Slim and Compact Desktop - Blue</a>&nbsp;is below the required 2.4GHz CPU speed. I was impressed that the license agreement actually allows the program to be returned within 30 days, and for it to be installed on up to 3 computers in your home. I was also impressed by the Web site, tutorials, and videos. The included manual is tiny, but a full one is on the DVD in PDF format, if needed.

Now all I have to do is actually create our home and yard design. That will take longer, so I'll update this when I've done that. Meanwhile, the program has impressed me greatly, and seems well worth the cost. For those with limited needs, other versions are available at lower cost, such as a Decks & Landscaping version. For Pros, there's also a higher-end Pro version, that may include a USB hardware protection device. Thankfully, this version only requires the usual product key code be entered when registering."
I ordered 2 of these for my granddaughters for their birthdays and they were a big hit.  They love shopping at Amazon.com and were very excited to pick up some things on their wish list.  They both really liked the cupcake containers.

One of my favorite magazines.  There is always at least one article that I end up tearing out of this magazine to save.  I love the little guides about how to repurpose everyday items as well as the ways to try organizing things differently than I have done in the past.
"Windows Live OneCare 2.0 introduces the managed services concept to home PC users. The software optimizes your PC with three closely related sets of programs:

1. 'Protection Plus' includes virus and spyware monitoring, anti-phishing filters and firewall to help keep the bad stuff away from you.
2. 'Performance Plus' optimizes your hard drive and repairs it in case something unwanted manages to get through or whenever you want to fine-tune your system; the set of utilities includes disk defragmentation, unnecessary file cleanup, scandisk for spyware/malware/viruses etc., and a check for security updates from Microsoft.
3. 'Backup and Restore' helps you configure your home network of up to 3 PCs and backup to either CD/DVD or an external device located on your network.

The software is intended to be used with the Live OneCare service where the latest software such as anti-virus definitions are downloaded. Activating the service was easy, and running all three of the services takes only a few minutes. Since the initial install, I have found the minimal time spent maintaining the service to be worthwhile; for example, I set the protection and performance functions to run at night when the computer is not in use.

While one might argue that is is possible to do some of the things that Windows Live OneCare does manually, the point is that you benefit from the software's automation of routine tasks which allows you to spend more time doing the things that you want to do. Additionally, it simply makes sense to be as proactive as possible and there is no better way to do that than to subscribe to a service that is continuously refreshed with the latest patches and security updates. By putting all these services together in a convenient package, Windows Live OneCare saves time and gives you the peace of mind knowing that your computing investment is protected.

THIS IS ONE OF THE BEAT INFORMATIVE MAGAZINES I HAVE READ.  LOTS OF RECIPES AND HOME DECORATING IDEAS AND ACTIVITIES FOR THE FAMILY TO DO
Love this magazine. Great advice and tips
"Does the job, but they keep changing the menus.  I don't use the new features."
"Love this.  I can't find it in the makeup stores.  It feels really good on my lips.  Other glosses cause my lips to become dry, especially on the edges of my lips.  This one doesn't and I get compliments on how good it looks on me by everyone."
"Upgrading from Norton 360 version 4.0 to version 5.0 was the easiest antivirus install I have experienced.  It took 10 minutes including the reboot and product activation.  It would have taken about a minute less if I didn't have to retype the monstrous product key three times.  If you are a user of version 4.0, the interface will feel very familiar.  One nice improvement is the performance tab.  You can mouse over icons on a particular date and see what was installed - software, windows updates etc. -what scans were done, what was downloaded and any threats detected.  There is also a safe web icon where you can enter and check out a URL before going there in your browser.

If you are upgrading, I have a word or warning.  After the upgrade your Norton will be all green checks indicating everything is in order.  This was not the case for me.  I ran Live-update just to make sure and it connected and downloaded over 100mb of data and required another reboot.  Another thing to do to improve performance after install is to run Norton Insight.  It increases performance by identifying files that do not need consistent scanning.

Of note, in the May 2011 edition of Maximum PC, Norton ranked 9 of 10 in their antivirus shootout.  It proved very effective in stopping viruses and malware.  It uses SONAR technology which watches program behavior to ID threats and not just virus definitions.  That is why I decided to continue using Norton.  Overall, I am very satisfied with the product."
"Really love the product--has made a visible difference in my skin.  Also, seller was great, product arrived MUCH sooner than expected."
"If you have a touch screen computer then I would consider adding a star and making this a 3 star product, otherwise, Office Pro 2013 is only a 2 star product in my book.

First - the graphical interface, what we users see, is awful.  Someone decided to return to the stone ages in terms of screen contrast. Those with vision issues will likely find this software horrible to use due to the lack of visual contrast.

Second - the pricing scheme is awful.  Check with your employer to see if their mass quantity licensing offers a deal for a 'home use' edition,through the Microsoft Home Use Program (MicrosoftHUP - google it!)  In those cases you can usually find the legal and legitimate sourcing of this software at $9.95 - for up to three systems at home (if the rules haven't changed in the past couple years.) The Home Use Program is often available to employees of the federal government and larger corporations.  (Microsoft - what about the rest of us? We're the ones who NEED special programs for home use!)

Third - if you've already spent good money on this software (or got it cheap through the home use program), why should we have to pay extra for cloud access? Why are we forced to stare at a marketing logo within the valuable ribbon real estate? Again poor choice for us power users.

Fourth - why should I need to buy the software then rent it again in the cloud as Office 365? Microsoft - take notice - Many IT people are refusing to use cloud based programs. Many of us will remain with older, outdated programs than migrate to cloud based apps.

Fifth - There are ample open source Office type programs (such as open office or libreoffice or free office, etc.. there are quite a few legitimate options - again, google it!) as well as 2010 and 2007 still be available and very appropriate desktop solutions. For most home office use it seems wisest to use the free versions such as open office then upgrade to Microsoft when you *need* the extra features included in MS Office suite.

Sixth - what does 2013 really bring to the table that was not available in 2010 (or 2007 for that matter?)  Other than much improved touch screen support, nothing substantial was brought to the screen. Or the desktop. Except the cloud - which many of us do NOT want or cannot use due to our employer policies.

All in all until I truly need the improved touch screen capability I would avoid MS Office 2013 and stick with the tried and true Office 2010 (or 2007 even!), at least until another version or two have been released. If I didn't have access to those programs then I would opt for the freeware / shareware versions instead of spending a small fortune on 2013.  But if you must go with Office 2013 for whatever reason, then the install is pretty straight forward.  Go to office's website /setup, login to the MS account (or create one if you have not before) enter in the product key (found inside this box when purchased).  The install process is quite lengthy, but you can do other things (like update this review) while the humongous software package downloads and completes the install.  Plan on a solid hour that the computer will need to be powered on and attached to the Internet (a factor for us laptop users to keep in mind!)"

"I absolutely prefer Turbo Tax over H&R Block software. The software is much clearer to use and the prompts are very helpful. I was upset that Intuit decided to exclude schedules C and D this year and so had purchased H&R Block's software. H&R Block had more difficulty with my minister's housing allowance so I relented and purchased Turbo Tax 2014. It handled my housing allowance just fine as it has all the past years I've used it. I don't use schedules C or D so that feature removal didn't impact me. I definitely prefer and recommend Turbo Tax over H&R Block. I haven't used Taxcut so I can't speak to it.

An Addendum: I've been a minister for some 30 years and have always done my taxes and have never been audited, knock on wood. Because of this I have tried to stay on top of tax filing requirements for ministers. As any minister knows filing taxes as a minister is pretty complex and requires a multitude of forms and actions that many ministers cannot follow, that a non-minister cannot understand, and that many tax professionals have difficulty with, if one is to satisfy IRS requirements which is a moving target. I offered a synopsis of my experience with H&R Block's software versus Turbo Tax. I did not list every detail for brevity and because I'm not going to put all ""my business on the street"". My opinion, subjective by definition, is that Turbo Tax does a better job of handling all the ins and outs of a minister's return and does it more smoothly with better explanations.

Take it for what it's worth. It's but one man's opinion."
"I tested all 10 levels with the Mac Air, version 10.9.4 and had no problem getting the program to load and work correctly. This was the same with the iPad 3. I want to be clear that I have no affiliation with Rosetta Stone, am not a product tester for the company, and purchased this for home use.

Listed below are some details about our experience, from set-up to working with the reading program. You can jump through the first few paragraphs and go directly to the section where we played the various games if you want the details about that.

Before that, I want to briefly note some first impressions and a general summary of the program itself. Am I glad that I purchased it? Yes. Do the kids want to use this and do they enjoy it? Yes, but only if I'm nearby to add extra feedback and encouragement. Does Rosetta Stone Kids Reading do what it is designed to do? Basically, yes....because I found that it helped teach the kids some basic reading skills - , all the way from ""pre-reading"" (identifying letters, shapes, colors, etc) to understanding how to spell and understand certain words, put them in proper order in a story, remember the key points of a story - both while the story is read and afterwards, etc.

Those are some of the benefits. .. and they're significant...but there is some room for improvement. It would be nice if the ""Lingos"" or the little character avatars had some varied responses instead of the same basic and chirpy ""Uh-huh!"" when a child picks the correct word or shape. Also, I wouldn't use this as a ""stand alone"" program for reading but as a very useful added resource. It is excellent practice but kids will probably still need other resources to build better skills.

The Rosetta Kids Reading may be  particularly helpful for kids who learn better by listening to words read aloud (auditory skills). And of course visual learning is an inherent part of the program.

So what about the games and exercises contained in this program?

Rosetta Stone Reading starts with simple sorting of shapes, colors, and letters for pre-readers, and eventually works up to reinforcing such advanced skills as learning compound words, distinguishing the different meanings of words which look the same (a kid can be a child or a baby goat, a pen can be an enclosure or a writing tool , etc. ), reading simple stories, selecting specific words out of a set of mix-up letters, etc.

I felt it  was vital for me to be there to assist both children as they worked - especially as they learned how to follow the general instructions, manipulate various letters and shapes, and type words on the keyboard. At that point, they could have handled many of the games alone but they remained much more interested when I was there to provide additional encouragement.

What I didn't like: The annoying repetitive sounds and phrases made by the various avatars  (known as Lingos). The kids and I wished there was some more variety in what they said. After each game was completed successfully, the Lingos did the same dance, with some minor variations. There could have been more variety there as well.

As noted above, every time an activity was completed successfully, the same enthusiastic ""Uh-huh!"" was heard. No variation, no change of tone. This got old - quickly But on the plus side,  the instructions were easy to understand and each step was clear. And a series of gold stars flashed when the exercises were completed successfully, providing quick feedback and some extra encouragement.

Because set-up is easy and well described online, I won't go into detail about that. It is intuitive and user friendly. Profiles can be set up for as many as 4 different kids.

I  can't describe every bit of the 10 levels, 50 games and 600 activities but hope that explaining some of the games we played will at least give a general sense of some parts of the program. I'm going to describe both easy and more advanced games.

One of the easiest beginner games was called Letter Match Up. At this level there are 8 activities and each one has to be completed successfully to unlock the next one. As the name implies, Letter Match Up requires kids to choose the 2 letters which are the same, selecting them out of a group of 4 letters. After the correct choice is made, the letters' names are spoken aloud by the ""avatar"".

More advanced games included Story Scramble and Sight Word Workout. In Story Scramble several sentences are shown and the child has to put them in order. In Sight Word Workout, there are a jumble of letters, with only a couple forming actual words. Children are asked to move a box over the word which is said by the Lingo avatar. Words like ""your""  or ""does"" and similar ones are used several times in one game so that kids get a chance to practice seeing the same word more than once.

Sight Word Workout also asks kids to spell simple words by typing the letters on the keypad. These become more advanced as the game progresses and more difficult levels are unlocked. Kids are also asked to spell longer words. We did play around with some other games, including one which created compound words by putting two separate words together. One example: putting the word ""lip"" and ""stick"" together to create lipstick. Later on, the meaning of each word was explained.

Please feel free to ask any questions and I'll be glad to answer and fill in any possible gaps in the information I provided."
"So I was supposed to learn how to touch type back in high school. I didn't and snuck by.  I should have learned how to type in college, I didnt.  I should have made sure I learned how to type during my first job.  Nope.  I got by being a 20 word per minute touch typer, making a lot of errors, and living on the benefits of spell checker.  Time for a change.
The program was easy to install on Windows 8, and it indicates it would also install on Windows 7 or even XP.  There is a registration key that limits the installation to one computer.
You start a profile and the program then sort of tests you to see where you are at, and develops a long term lesson plan of exercises for you to follow in order to get better.  I have been using this program for about a month now for a little bit of time about every other day and not I am about a 35 words per minute real typer.  No more hunting and pecking.  I hope to continue to use to get up to a decent 50 words per minute so I can get some of my reports done sooner.
I had a friend 9 year old come over one day and they tried the program and they enjoyed it as well, not as kid friendly as the kids version of the program, but it could still teach them typing.  Overall a great program, highly recommended."
"I liked X6 quite a bit for making animations, slide show videos and editing videos because it was clear and intuitive. This version has a few more bells and whistles, but it's mostly the same program. Except it's a lot faster.

What I like about VideoStudio is that it's somewhere between being absolutely a beginner's video editing program and a full featured pro editing software. It's more than enough for the types of videos that I make- mostly instructional craft videos or simple animations and slideshows. Putting in subtitles, or timing the animation frames is easy to do. Adjusting a slideshow to fit the music I'm setting it to is also easy.

It does use a lot of memory still, but as long as I'm not trying to work with huge graphics in my graphics suite at the same time I'm editing a video- it hasn't frozen or crashed my system. So it seems very stable.

I like the speed, and still like how easy it is to use. It installs easily. My only complaint is that you have to download a user's manual."
"When I built my first computer recently, I chose Windows Vista Ultimate. I would be lying if I said that I liked this operating system. I have just had too many problems. First, I could not install the drivers for my APU. It's GPU part says that the standard vga adapter failed to start. I had to put an old Geforce 9600 GSO 512 in it. Next, it had several issues with emulating. I get blue screen when ever I try to emulate n64, and gamecube emulating got progressively slower. Instead of being able to run a game at 150% speed, I only get 85% to 100% game speed. I also had problems with installing Directx. Every time I ran the Directx installer, it failed to install. I had to rely on NBA 2k13 to install Directx for me. So now I bought Windows 7 to replace this OS. I recommend that you save time and money, and just go buy Windows 7."
"I got this because I love to make cards and invitations, etc. I used Microsoft Office before getting this product. Right out of the box, the installation is very easy. However, the registration process wants you to call a number. I found that I can go onto their website to register but it's a bit of a hassle and I haven't had a need to register yet.

Overall, the usage of the software is fairly simple. You just drag the item you want (text, picture, etc.) anywhere and you can resize it accordingly. This reminds me of Photoshop's layout the way it is set up. So while it's pretty simple for me, it may be a little bit of a challenge for someone who never used a software like this before.

There are a few different templates alrady there to be used. However, I found that a lot of them do not fit my needs and wish there were more to select from as there are only a few. I made business cards with this and found it pretty decent once I get the hang of the software. However, when you export or save it, it doesn't save it as the size of an actual business card. This caused problems at a local printer as they need it to be the exact size of a business card. I just used a different printer but what you see in the software is not always the correct size once exported.

This is otherwise a decent software. You can make a lot of different kind of publications, including wine and jar labels."
This is the best S&Ts by far with voice commands and large directional and distance information; connects effortlessly to Magellan GPS. Just came back from a 500 mile trip with it running the whole time.... took me right to the door of a destination I had  never been to before. Accurate every step of the way... excellent voice quality on direction and distance.... One does not even have to look at the laptop screen for an entire trip. Well worth twice the price. What is missing on the pocket PC version is fantastic on the laptop version: the route and the voice info.... so 5 stars for the PC version and 3 stars for the pocket PC version. I still would not be without it for the pocket PC even with the shortcomings.
"UPDATE 1/24/09:

I am still very satisfied with this product.  So far I've entered all my data, and it's been pretty painless, both for Fed & State taxes.

I have to qualify this by saying that my taxes are pretty simple this year, with no AMT, no sch C, no sch K, etc.  So I'm not really running into some areas that are often not handled well in tax software.

One thing I liked better than turbo tax was the simpler handling of tax-exempt income, splitting the in-state vs. out-of-state portions.  Also, similarly, the handling of US Treasury interest (tax-exempt for state tax).  Turbo Tax makes you enter separate 1099s for each part, instead of just capturing the information within one form dialog.

On the other side, I have some additional critiques:
(1) no ability to import/download W2 & 1099 data (not that I found, anyway)
(2) form 1116 has to be filled out manually, even if it's pretty straightforward -- they could have and should have provided an interview for this
(3) no way provided to simply delete a line in a form (minor point, turbo tax has this, and I find it very useful) -- you can of course delete the data in the line

INITIAL REPORT:

Obviously, it's a bit too early to provide a thorough review of the program, because it's essentially incomplete (as is TurboTax): many tax forms are still not available in their final form.  There will be a Dec 11 update, and I expect several others over the next couple of months.  (I've learned from past experience not to submit final returns until late March, since the bug fixes and form corrections are often not final until then.  This is true for either TurboTax or TaxCut.)

However, here's my current take: this is a fine program, and certainly more than adequate for the necessary help preparing a tax return.  I've used TaxCut in the past, but have used TurboTax for the past few years.  I decided to use TaxCut this year because of the price difference, and because the new licensing policy for TT is annoying.  So far I'm finding it easy to use, and trouble-free in importing data from the previous year TurboTax file and current year TXF files.

One minor weakness compared to TurboTax: I remember that in the 07 TT you could remove a specific set of imported data; I haven't found anything like that in this program.  Not a biggie for me, since I always save ""checkpoints"" in separate files so I can revert to a previous version if I need to, but it's the kind of little thing that makes TT a bit better in my opinion. Just not sufficiently better that I will pay anything Intuit wants to charge (just a matter of principle for me).

Some general comments, based on experience over many years of doing my own (often very complicated) returns:  Neither program is perfect by any means.  For many complicated situations you have to do your own calculations externally (I use Excel), or enter data manually.  Be aware that dealing with AMT, AMT credits, and stuff like that remains mind-bendingly difficult, just not as nightmarish as doing them without a program to help.  And you should always sanity check your results, because odd calculation bugs can persist for a long time.  (I found a very stupid, but hard to find, calculation bug in TurboTax a few years ago, having to do with AMT.)

I will post an update in a few weeks when I've had the chance to make more progress with my return.  Will be able to review the state program as well at that point, perhaps."
"I found a Cooking Light magazine from 2009 and tried their banana bars with browned butter pecan frosting. Can I say delicious (the bananas are roasted with brown sugar and butter first), but I think personally I'd about half the sugar. When they say light in this magazine they seem to mean reducing fat. So the recipe had 8.4g of fat but 35.1g of carbs . I think if they are going to say a recipe is healthier they should also reduce the sugar. So next time I'll remember how sweet the cake was and lower the amount of sugar to say 3/4 cup instead of 1 1/4 cup. Light to me at least seems to mean less fat AND sugar. I didn't play around with the recipe because I only had three bananas and couldn't afford to get it wrong on the first try. I'll try other recipes in this magazine if I find any in the future but I'll remember to pay attention to the sugar.

~The Rebecca Review"
"Us weekly is mostly about what the stars are wearing and the latest trend on television.  There are some tabloid style photos which are completely tasteless, and I'm not really sure who cares if Brittany Spears had a latte at Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf on 4th street last Wednesday, but mostly it's a fair gossip magazine.  The articles are all really short and definitely without much depth, but most people aren't looking for that when they read Us weekly.  The fashion police is pretty funny; it's just a bunch of comments about star's clothes from a group of people with no real authority on the subject.  Most are comedians or writers, which is probably why it's so funny.  This magazine is definitely a quick read, and I don't feel any smarter when I'm done reading it, but it does keep me up to date on the Hollywood side of pop culture."
Reliable software I continue to buy
"Snow Leopard is a very stable and user friendly system software. I am still using it on my 27"" iMac. Many of my clients also still use this system because of its speed and stability."
"So thankful I can read my Kindle books outside of the Kindle. This one for PC works well, is intuitive and handy. Wherever I leave off on either my Kindle or iPad, this application automatically detects and gives me the option to catch up. Well done and easy to use. Easy to read, too. Easily customized just enough to matter."
"I have used Kaspersky for a while, because its more affordable than some other options for what you get. However it does slow the computer quite a bit. The security feature ""secure money"" whatever its called that opens a new secure window when ever you buy something, or do online banking, is a huge pain. Its very glitchy and I'm not sure how much it really helps. A full system scan takes FOREVER. I have to make sure I start it before I go to bed because they've been taking 7+ hours. The last one only took 2.5 hours and that shocked me, which is sad because that is still really long. When a scan is going, the computer is so slow I can't even use it (without flying into an impatient rage). However, I have never gotten any viruses or had any security breaches with my laptop so it appears to be doing its job."
"I love this magazine. It has short articles that can be read on the run, and I learn something new everytime I read an issue."
I have been using TurboTax for many years and it is indeed the best program in it's class.
"I've used H&R Block for a dozen years now and in general I find it slightly better than ""TurboTax"" (the two are really very close to equal).

This year I had a question about the Minnesota Property Tax Return so I chatted with H&R Block support.  Their person basically said ""I don't know anything about taxes and I don't know how our software works.""  {laugh} That seems like pretty useless support.

It's a real toss up as to whether it is better to do your taxes by hand or to use a piece of software like this.  If you do your taxes by hand you will have a much better understanding of what you are filing (but it will still be confusing at points).  If you use the software it is ""easier"" as long as you just blindly click ""next"" and pray the software is doing it right (it missed one thing which I had to go back and manually figure out what was wrong and that made a $1000 difference on my return).

Note: this is all from the point of view of a person who is filing for income from both a normal job and a Schedule C for their own business.

To be fair, I think the tax software has an almost impossible job and 99% of the fault is with the government for making tax code so complex that only the wealthy (who can afford a tax attorney and accountant to optimize their taxes) can reasonably deal with filing taxes or the very low end of the income scale that has virtually nothing to report and can just do the ""EZ"" version."
"In all fairness, Intuit has done a good job refining Quicken over the last decade. There is only so many functions you need in a personal finance software. So Intuit is now forcing the users to upgrade by shutting down online feature of the past versions, which I think it's a bad business practice. But I can live with that, if it provides an effortless upgrade. Unfortunately, it doesn't.

Every upgrade is full of problems. The latest episode is upgrading from 2010 to 2013. It won't accept the file password after upgrade. I had to use Quicken password removal tool, by uploading my Quicken file to Intuit server; which has an upload speed of 50kb/sec and download speed is about 30KB/sec. Really Intuit, you can't afford broadband speed?

After an hour of troubleshooting, I was able to open the file with Quicken password removal tool. And all seems to be there...fingers crossed.

***WARNING***
Quicken password removal tool only supports certain versions. A statement from its website:
""The Password Removal Tool will only work with data file passwords used in currently supported versions of Quicken for Windows. So, what that means is it will not work on data files for Quicken for Mac (including Quicken Essentials), older versions of Quicken for Windows (Quicken 2008 and older), nor other passwords associated with Quicken such as transaction passwords and your password vault.""

Make sure you backup your file BEFORE installing 2013, otherwise you might never be able to open your file again."
"After success with the first two games in the Nancy Drew adventure game series, the creators tried to step up the suspense with a scarier mystery.  In ""Message in a Haunted Mansion"" they definitely did that while still making it a fun adventure game that wasn't horrifying.

Story-You are going to help a family friend find out why there are so many accidents happening at the house that she's renovating.  Some people claim that a ghost is at work, while others think that something human is the cause.  It's up to you to find out who or what is sabotaging the renovation work.

Graphics-Like the previous games, the graphics are 3D, and once again, they are pretty good.  Some of the characters have some awkward movements, but the backgrounds are very well done.

Sound-The music is spooky and definitely creates a good atmosphere.  There are also some creepy background sounds that happen from time-to-time to startle the player a bit.  As for the voice acting, the characters could have been voiced much better.  They often sound bored or confused as to what they are reading, but they are still good enough to not distract from the gameplay.

Gameplay-Just like the previous games in the series, this is a first person point-and-click adventure game.  It only takes place in one location (a mansion), but you are still able to explore many rooms as you search for clues as to who or what is causing the accidents.  There are four suspects to talk to in this game, and there are also several people that you can call on the phone to ask for help in your investigation.  There are a few puzzles in the game that are more like chores than puzzles, but they are a good variety of inventory puzzles and logic puzzles.  There are a few scary moments in the game where you see a shadow move or something in order to startle you, but they would happen over and over again at the same place that by the end of the game, you are just bored by them.  It does add a certain scare factor to the game the first time you see them, though.  There are also some bonus backstories for two of the characters that you don't necessarily have to discover to finish the game, but it was fun to figure out, and it adds a bit to the plot.

Length-It's a fairly long game.  It will definitely take several hours to finish.

Overall, it can be a slightly creepy game if you let it get to you.  But whether you get spooked or not, it truly is a fascinating mystery adventure game that is worth a playthrough.

SPECIAL NOTE-There is also a version of this game available for the Game Boy Advance."
"I've used Painter since it was made by Fractal Labs years ago, went through two changes of ownership and was originally sold in a cigar box (like a sketcher's pencil box of supplies. Very cute.) Over the years, wet media were added (oils, brushes, watercolor, pastels, inks) and the effects you can get, along with a graphics tablet are amazing. While you can free-hand art, it is a lot of fun to ""clone"" a photograph or drawing and use layers to achieve a painterly effect with no actual wet media.

Is it easy to use? Not exactly. For me, it's not bad as I am familiar with the package and the principle of layers. And it's resource heavy and slow; you can't push your computer too fast (unless you have a killer graphics card and memory) or you will freeze up your system. Still, this remains my favorite digital art package for serious work. I can do most things with Photoshop Elements, but for real wet-media look, this is the one."
"The Movie Edit Pro has as many features as other software of a similar type, but the 3D section cannot be output to another device or downloaded to your computer. I'm thinking I'll have to wait until they update the software to be able to use that. I was very disappointed this didn't work because it's a feature Roxio and other software of this type doesn't provide."
Dont like extra fee. Will buy straight from store from now on.
This product has all the form I need and it is easy to navigate.  Shipped fast and at a great price.
"MY wife has this on her PC, so when the project to track her side was going strong, I wanted to do the same for my side, and it was no small task that just winds on, and thankfully doing well.

Family Tree Maker for Mac utilizes and adds in enough fire power and resources to make the dig fascinating and far more interesting than I'd expected. It is a RUSH to uncover so much, and the avenues I've been going down. comes with online resources to the best ancestry searches you could ever hope for. Well worth it and boy, a BIG hit at a recent family dinner!"
Stay away from this one. Way to buggy. They ruined a once great software and turned it into the current worst software.
Too many ads and tabloid style writing make this publication not worth your while.
Best coffee ever
TERRIBLE AT TASK !
"I ordered this so that I could convert docs to editable PDF's, but this product does not do the job.
I'm so disappointed...but learned later that the product that actually makes editable PDF's is the ""convert"" program, not the ""create"" program.
Do not buy this is you are needing to convert docs to editable pdf's."
Thought they were kind of grown up for my grandsons until I opened them. Really cute pop up!
I FIND THIS SOFTWARE HARD TO USE.  IT IS MUCH FASTER TO DO IT BY HAND. EVERY YEAR I HAVE A ACCOUNTANT DO MY TAXES BUT I LIKE TO DO IT MY SELF FIRST. THIS PROGRAM ASK TOO MANY QUESTIONS AND REQUIRES TOO MUCH INFOMATION. THE PROGRAM ASK MANY MORE QUESTIONS THAN THE IRS
this item is wonderful.  it enabled me to install things permanently instead of having to disconnect and reconnect.  i couldn't be happier.  and it has the power to run things.  i'm a computer illiterate but i know when my life is easier and less complicated.
What could go wrong with an amazon gift card

This was  a great way to learn Italian vocabulary on a small level. Very easy to use and has some great games to help you learn.
Can you say you love a tax program? Well the H & R Block Tax software is worthy of that claim. It was easy to install and start using right away. I have used Turbo Tax for 25 years and was very unhappy when they changed the software. The H & R Block Tax software is all I need as a homeowner with some investments. I am a new loyal customer.
OK
daughter loves this magazine and the price was great
"I keep purchasing Quicken hoping that it will finally do something of value. Whoever is designing this software is not in business for themself. Awful. If all you want to do is record what $$$ you have and what you are bringing or spending then just use Excel. Quicken offers no other advantages. Doesn't even xfer data correctly to Turbotax. Ergo, I refer to this as junk software. I think Intuit should refund the cost of this software to everyone who finds it as useless as I have."
"Watch your media and videos come alive, BR was made for this software.  PC use is easy and simple.  A must have for yhour home collection."
My girlfriend really enjoyed her time at the movies.
Wished I had got one. O well maybe next year. Great idea for stocking stuffers. Good gift for the hard to please
Better than last year but I did not like the the up-sell to use the investments at full cost as I would have saved 30 percent buying the version on Amazon!  I will use it again but watch out for the small print and buy the more advanced product avoiding the up-sell
"Card worked fine and I love this restaurant, but I spent it all in the store portion before I ate. Lol."
"I was nervousness about the scent because IVe never tried this, but I love Paul Mitchell so I decided to try it.  It smells great!!!  This is a medium hold spray, so I'll use it when my hair is down (I use a stronger hold when I put my hair up).  Shipping speed was good to Alaska too."
"I occasionally do video projects, so I was excited to see the new version of Corel Studio. I find it to be exceptionally powerful, with lots of effects and good performance in editing and rendering.

The program came on two DVDs: one for the program (32 or 64 bit) and one for the extra add-on programs. Installation was painless, except that there was no integrated install screen; the two disks are stand-alone, and one might think at first that the second disk is for 32 bit or something. Not a big deal, but it would have been nice to have better labels than ""Disk 1"" and ""Disk 2"". Several of the add on programs tried to install the .net framework (which is already installed in Windows 8), but functioned fine. My system is an AMD Phenom 6 at 3.4 Ghz, with a 250Mb SSD that I used for the program, and a 2 TB data disk. I have 16 Gb of memory.

For new folks, there is a program called FastFlick, which opens up a set of templates that can be used to rapidly create a video. From what I can tell it is best suited to making picture slide shows, although various elements can be edited, and custom music can be used. But it pales in comparison to the capabilities of the main program.

For experienced users, or those wanting to be, the program offers seemingly endless possibilities for creating a sophisticated video. There are many options for transitions, editing, titles, music, mixing, and, well, just about anything. The program works by importing media files into the main program, then dragging the files onto a timeline. After that one can use additional tracks to add titles, music, additional video overlays, FX transitions, and many other options. A small preview area offers basic editing and clipping, plus full screen or partial screen preview. After the video is completed, there are options to ""share"" it, which means save in various formats: Computer (AVI, MPEG, H.264, MPEG-2, or WMV), phone optimized, Web optimized (HTML-5 projects are possible), DVD (including menus), or 3D. The program features full multi-processor support and 4K (I don't have any 4K video to test it with, however). The interface is advertised as more streamlined, and I did indeed find that it seemed to work better (particularly the add-in programs). Also included is a stand-alone handy screen capture/recording program, which would be good for creating presentations showing how a computer program is run. There are a number of templates, which are basically the components of the FastFlick program, but broken apart for individual use in the main program; these would provide a new user with some place to start. For those so inclined, the program integrates with a camera to perform stop-motion.

Performance wise, I rendered a 4 minute video in 9 minutes, which is a bit better than previous versions of the program.

Documentation is strictly online via a PDF file that can be either viewed or downloaded. The add-ons bring up a help file when needed; I found the manual and add-in files to be well written and useful. When the program opens up, one is offered the opportunity to view some tutorials on the ""discovery center"", which requires registration. There are additional templates and such available on line once registration is complete.

There are a number of add-ons bundled with the program. They are pretty easy to use; simply drag them to the clip, and then open the options and customize the effect - thus they are plug-ins and not stand-alone. They are found in the FX portion of the program. Titles include:

Boris Graffiti 6 - Animated titles
Newblue Colorfast - color correction
ProDad Mercalli SE - video stabilization (worked very well)
ProDad Vitascene V2 LE - this has a series of special effect screens
proDAD RotoPen - Produces a nice pen effect across the screen.
proDAD Handscript Animation - allows some custom movement of the screen
NewBlue Motion effect - Smear, liquify, etc. effects

Summary: A powerful program that needs some time to learn, but allows the user to put out basic projects fairly quickly, or complex projects with a bit more work. Highly Recommended."
It was a gift card.  What can I say.
"So yes the little bottle is $20.00 however if you're looking for relief from baby being at the breast, this little bottle is like gold for them. It goes such a long way. You don't need much. It's not greasy feeling like some lanolin can get. We have actually used in for our 8 month old through teething & rash. We'd throw some on at bed & by morning good as new! I highly highly recommend this to all new moms!"
"TurboTax 2011 has the same easy interface as prior years. The navigation seems a bit easier this year than the past years. I used to print out the TurboTax forms to mail them in. Now, I just used e-File. The federal and state returns are both free for the TurboTax Deluxe version! 2 hours with various tax documents and my TurboTax and I am done!  The only minor nit is that the loading time for the program is a bit longer than other years. Not a deal breaker though."
"Would not recognize my registered email, and turn off all saved passwords in firefox browser. Uninstalled bought another anti virus software. What a wasted $20"
"It's ok. It burns data disks. But windows burns data disks. It burns images. Just google ""iso recorder powertoy"" and you'll find a great free iso burner (works in 8 great even though it only mentions through windows 7). It lets you copy disks (which you can do with the free iso recorder). It lets you burn music cds--doesn't media player do that as part of windows? So the first half of the program does stuff with disks, but who needs more than free to do this? It does fine doing all these things, but it's not amazing. It's kinda clunky.

Then it lets you edit movies and edit movie dvds. It is easier than Premier Elements, but I prefer Premier still because I have more options. It does this ok, but you can't burn Bluray disks in this version. To be honest, again there isn't much more that this does than the free Windows Movie Maker does... And if you really need more than Movie Maker, you probably need Premier Elements for the real next step up.

And I guess the biggest problem is that the whole program is a relic from the past. I burn probably 10 disks a year. I don't remember the last time I made a music CD. I do make a dvd a year for grandma, but I already have Adobe Premier Elements for that. And most people just upload to youtube! There has to be a smaller and smaller market for this. I mean most ultrabooks don't even come with disk drives! I'm sure there's not enough money to make a better and better program here--just enough money to churn out a new version every year with slight improvements.

And it definitely is a better program than the version I used a few years back and crashed all the time. But now that Creator has arrived to the party in good condition, the party's winding down...

Additional info 1/24/2014: So I needed to burn a .img disk image that I downloaded from the Microsoft Office site. It's a disk download of Microsoft Office for my friend with really slow internet. I've seen .img files before so I know that extension is not unheard of, and I assume that since Microsoft is using it that it's a normal image type. Well, Roxio doesn't recognize it as a disk image format. But the free iso recorder powertoy does. Since Roxio fails me the one time I actually needed it, I'm reducing the rating to one star and uninstalling the software."
"Seamlessly runs Windows programs.  No problems with any programs so far.  Quicken, Office Pro, Roller Coaster Tycoon 3, Flight Sim, and others run flawlessly."
"This Norton method can slow down performance since it routes through Norton, but also gives significant privacy.  I always suspected public wi-fi wasn't safe.  It only felt safe when seeing everybody else using that connection and conducting all their business.

I find this program super easy to use while on public networks using my iPad and laptop.  It uses a virtual private network with Norton - entirely unnecessary when on my home network.  This is making me feel more secure when on public wi-fi."
"I tested this software on both Windows Vista SP1 and Mac OS 10.5.6 this past weekend and it seems to work fine on both.  I used a new Wacom Intuos 4 Tablet with the software.  The software seems fairly easy to learn how to use and I think for the amount of money asked(under $100) it is a great product.  One thing I really appreciated is that Autodesk does not seem to use irritating product activation like a lot of software companies do these days.  The responsiveness of the brush engine to user input is excellent.  It provides smooth trouble free operation unlike what happens sometimes with competing products.  This makes drawing pure pleasure.

All in all this product is highly recommended as a low cost solution."
"This seems like it will be nice, but after playing around with it a bit, I found that I rarely actually used it.  For those who may have never developed typing skills, you may find this to be of some help, but I've found I'm more productive with just standard typing."
The easiest and most detailed financial capability system I have used. I would not hesitate to tell others about this product.
"These little Santa Claus tins are so cute, I don't even have to wrap them.  Great gifts for the nephews and brother-in-law!"
"I bought Webroot SecureAnywhere Antivirus 2013 because it was highly rated in a prominent computer website. Part of the high rating was for good system performance. That wasn't my experience. I had Avast Internet Security, but switched to Webroot SecureAnywhere Antivirus because of the high rating in the computer website review. My mouse arrow was slow to respond and I often saw the spinning circle telling me to wait for functions that used to happen quickly. After a couple of days watching my computer do its own thing, I decided that I wanted to take back my computer. I uninstalled Webroot SecureAnywhere Antivirus and reinstalled Avast Internet Security. My computer is now fast again. Avast Internet Security doesn't get as good a review as Webroot SecureAnywhere Antivirus, but I get to use my computer. By the way, my computer is Win 7, with a fast Intel processor, 8GB RAM, and a high-power graphics board, so it is fast, without Webroot SecureAnywhere Antivirus."
"Well, this was the easiest piece of software I have had to install in a long time.  Normally with the AV software something needs to be removed, something doesn't work or isn't compatible.  This...no problem. As for how it works, none of them are perfect but this seems to not be as much as a resource hog as others on the market.  Anyway, for simple, easy to use protection for the computer, this isn't bad."
"Let me discuss most of the other reviews first, then I will get to mine. It is kind of important for a software company to nail their demographic when making a product. Its just the way it is that most people doing genealogy are going to be older adults. This is because as we get older it is more important to make a link with our time here. There are some younger people doing this to be sure but most I have met are generally older adults. Regarding that I believe they may have made this a tad bit user-unfriendly. If you are well versed in computers then you cannot even see why they are having an issue. Just getting my mother to move one window over another on the desktop takes me 5 minutes and I have been building PC's since the '80s it gets pretty frustrating. My recommendation to this company is to make an interface that mimics something found in an Apple product. Simple intuitive and foolproof.

----------My review-----------
Overview:
Ok lets say I love this software! For the past year I have been putting all of my family history on Ancestry. It has been pretty good with regard to finding details out that I might not know. The main issue I have with Ancestry is the monthly cost. With this software you get 3 months deluxe US, which is almost 2x the cost of this product, for that alone its worth it.

Reports:(+)
So what makes this software so great? The reports mostly. I have one branch of my tree go back to 1060. Thats more than can be shown on any tree available from Ancestry. The farthest you can go on the web is around 3 generations not 25 generations. With the reporting tools on this software you can get a variety of reports that flesh out your family. Ones such as marriage report listing whom everyone was married to. A generation report listing who was born under whom. Honestly there are too many to list here, each one is a very unique way to view a part of the story.

Seamless integration with Ancestry:(+)
I lost not a single bit of data transferring it from the web down to my computer. All I did was log into ancestry from Family Tree Maker and it drew down all of the data in a GENCOM file. Once in the software it populated a local database with over a years worth of work. With my personal experience this was pretty great.

Trees:(+/-)
Along with reports the trees available are all great tools for showing your family. I mean the software is Family Tree Maker it should also print out the trees. It does with some great designs. Unfortunately the trees on the software are also limited. I believe you can go back max 6 generations but then it stops. The designs are pretty good to show different relationships. Overall I would have liked more generations, knowing the tree would be physically huge but that is what I want to show.

Manual: (-)
Holy cow! This is the most convoluted huge tome I have seen in a very long time for a manual. My advice; skip it. Nice effort on their part to add it but it makes even opening the box a daunting appearing task that might scare more users than help them.

Summary: (+/-)
If you are a versed internet user/ computer operator you can expect this software to perform as an essential at-home addition to the work you have done on Ancestry. If you are just starting out on this journey it might be better for you to use the website first and then start using the software. Their website has much of the same interface and use along with other family members you may not know providing key pieces to your tree. I don't think of this as a solo tool but instead as an augmentation of another (Ancestry). As that, it excels.

Thank you for reading my review."

Great Christmas gift
I bought this for Christmas and my brother reported that it worked as expected
"I had very high hopes for this software, as I wanted to take advantage of it for real estate purposes.  Since I am also new to the product, I was also curious about the interface, in that I didn't have any expectations based on previous versions, unlike others that have posted here.

Suffice it to say that any hopes I had were destroyed almost instantly.  This is one of the worst user interfaces I've seen in quite a while, certainly in a major product from a major publisher (and I'm a software development exec).  Virtually everything is non-standard and few things work as expected: clicks and double clicks, right/left button functionality, drag & drop, highlighting & selecting, map navigation, context menus, zooming, export & import, etc.  The iconography is just awful, awful - reminiscent of the software of a decade or more ago.  I also found the functionality outside of routing and route planning (both of which are excellent) to be more restrictive than hoped, with particular disappointment in the territory functionality, territory definitions being too limited for my uses.  Finally, the map graphics themselves just don't make the grade.  While readable, they don't display any real quality until quite closely zoomed, looking quite sketchy to that point.

The high point of the software is the routing functionality, as mentioned above.  It is powerful, flexible, and has many options I have not seen elsewhere, and which are far beyond anything available in Google Maps, Mapquest, or other web-based mapping software.  If this is your primary interest or need, this software is for you, even with the issues mentioned above.

Still, had I to break it down, I'd give MapPoint 2009 5 stars for routing, 4 for Microsoft software integration (Outlook, Excel, Access, etc.), and 1 for everything else.  Couple that with its rather steep price and I really can't give it more than 2 stars overall.  Very disappointing."
Love Applebee's!
"This software does not change much from year to year. The reason we keep buying it is that the ""online"" features expire after two years. Personally I am quite comfortable with this arrangement. Those online features cost money to provide, and Intuit chooses to require repeated purchases to use them. The only sane alternative would be an annual subscription fee. I like this software a lot so I buy it every year. It would be perfectly sensible to buy it every two years instead.

This is simply the best software of its kind available. In my use, it is stable and dependable. The feature set is impressive. I would like more report types and a better life planner, but I don't find anything that comes close to what Intuit offers here.

I believe that anyone with either a family or a decent income should use Quicken. Spending and saving your money involves decisions every day. It is better to drive those decisions with data than to rely solely on your instincts.

The modern alternative to Quicken is a fully web-based, free service such as Mint. You get what you pay for. You give away your privacy too.

Me, I will stick with Quicken as long as it is available. I back up my home computer frequently. My financial data is private and secure, living on my home disk drive and my encrypted backup drives."
"I continue to be amazed by today's video editors for home use and how good they do the job. This product in addition to all the core video editing features contains a new application called content-aware editing.

Content-aware editing attempts to do the rough initial editing for you automatically by identifying the most interesting scenes as well as scenes that need some editing. It scans and looks for pans, zooms, motion and faces. The scenes with problems are fixed using Cyberlink's TrueTheater technology for example shaky/unstable camera and low lighting correction. Then select your scenes and import them to the timeline for more editing and refinement. This new application has the potential to save users import time and processing time. How useful is this? It could certainly help with initial editing of a long video. Just don't forget the one scene or scenes that you want to include such as a beautiful sunset still shot.

Other highlights include:
64-bit TrueVelocity 3 with faster editing - multi GPGPU support optimizes itself to your computers processing and graphics capabilities. For example multiple graphics (integrated graphics and a graphics card) to speed up editing, rendering and effect processing.

Numerous Input/Output formats supported

Dark interface

Ripple editing

Improved color correction

Redesigned tools for PIP (Picture in picture designer for animating visual elements), particle effects, titles and menus with the ability to see full screen.

Resize the preview window or even move it to a second monitor.

3D capability

Surround sound capability

I find this to be a good to great video editor with power!"
"Bought this from RetailSoftware and it works as advertised.  No problems installing, activating, or using it.  Brand new.  Came with COA and key.  So far, so good."
"Great Gift to my Niece, she very happy with this for she is vegetarian and they have lots of veggies to pick from for her sandwich"
Bought as a gift! They loved it!!
"Microsoft seems to have stripped most of the functionality out from previous versions of word and the help function is pointless.

This program is far inferior to any previous version. Not an upgrade at all."
"Like pretty much every PC owner, you need to protect your system from the ever-increasing number of threats on the Internet.

I typically like to stick with the big names when it comes to security products and I've been using McAfee for years.

Installation was exceedingly easy and well thought out. I already had a different McAfee A/V package installed but it had expired a week or so previous, so I was a bit worried how complicated removing the old one and installing the new one was going to be. As it turns out, it was virtually painless.

I dropped in the new CD, launched the installer and the new software recognized my old software, uninstalled it, then installed itself in its place. After the obligatory restart, it downloaded the newest definitions and I was good to go.

Operation of this software is similar to many others. You can change the scanning schedule and how intrusive it is. It periodically downloads new updates and prompts you to restart the system to activate the changes. While I dislike having to restart, that's kind of the way things work on WIndows systems and go with the flow.

The built in firewall doesn't see much in the way of incoming attacks since I'm behind a hardware firewall, but the outgoing firewall keeps a pretty good eye on things.

Overall, I'm pretty impressed with this software and will continue to use McAfee to protect my PCs."
"I have used every Windows version since Windows v1. This is the best version, yet. I got the Professional version of XP because I wanted Remote Desktop, more access-rights configurability and NTFS (you can manually do it on Home). I have been very pleased with this. It is much more stable than 98SE, 98 or 95. It is more stable than my 2000 as well. It actually is considered a 2000 upgrate -- from 5.0 to 5.1 -- but the feature changes are more dramatic and should warrant a 5.5 or 6.0. It is finally multi-user (not multi-account like 2000), so all users can stay logged on with applications running. That being said, to use that functionality, you definitely want to heed the ""minimum requirements""."
"I've bee using Norton since the early to mid '90s and have not been infected with a virus yet, and Norton has caught so many."
"After upgrading to Windows 7, my Spyder2Express was no longer recognized as a USB device.  I contacted DataColor's support and they said that it ""should"" work but that it had been replaced ""some time ago"" by Spyder3.  I should download the latest drivers, which I had already done.  Since I felt as though I was blown off, I decided to try a different brand: Pantone!  I bought a Pantone Huey and it worked nicely and it was cheaper than what I paid for the Spyder2Express several years ago."
"It is gorgeous and useful set of apps that I use primarily in collaboration with iLife applications. It is not a complete office solution as MS  Office compatibility (that is de-facto standard) is limited. I have plenty of documents in both Word and Excel formats that aren't do well in iWork. Considering that ""home and student"" of 2011 edition is so inexpensive, I would be thinking twice before spending on this iWork. It feels nice, it works well, but interoperability, that is a crucial requirement for office application is not there. The documents completed in iwork aren't looking the same in Word and Excel. I can't say that it is their problem , because if you put together a resume, you wan t it to be nicely looking in Word, as most people will open it this way."
"Yes it does install on a Windows 7 64bit machine, because I installed it on mine.  There are of course issues, since it should have been made to install on 32 or 64 bits just as easily as one or the other.  And I'm assuming it's just 64bit that has the issue and not Windows 7 vs Vista or XP (yes xp! lol).

I believe, if memory serves me right, install normally with admin rights maybe, and then you have to adjust the program executable, ie., right click run in compatibility mode or admin rights, etc etc.

Great tool that works great by itself or even better with a gps device.  Doesn't just give directions, but you can also input various data options, such as gas, mileage of the vehicle, stops, etc.

Looking forward to the next version and hopefully will install without user interference for Windows 8 32 and 64 bits."
AAA+
So horribly full of superficial crap. I regret ordering it.
"I've always been a fan of McAfee's Total Protection, so I was a bit skeptical about Webroot.

But, after installing it on my laptop, my fears have been alleviated.  The total install size was much smaller than what I'm used to, but all the functionality is there.  Better still, the default security settings on Webroot didn't make my machine unusable:  no overly restrictive firewall rules, no quarantining half of my programs, no blocking web access to my favorite games.

Installation was clean and simple.  The initial scan took a long time, but completed with no issues and no false alarms.positives as of yet, and no blocked apps.  I don't download freeware/shareware off of the internet, so I guess the woes of my fellow reviewers don't apply to me at all.

Solid product. Easy to use."
"The McAfee Site Advisor utility is designed to keep you informed about potentially harmful websites that appear in search engines so you can avoid them. The software is set-up to report sites that contain spyware, browser exploits and other viruses that could mess with your machine. The sites are indentified by McAfee and the utility comes with a year's subscription to update the list of potentially harmful sites.

The utility is easy to install and takes up little in the way of resources. I run a very recent install of Windows Vista and had no issues setting up the software.

Most computer security software suits include some kind of functionality similar to this, so you really should check your existing security software before purchasing it.

The price is low enough and the software simple and useful enough that I can recommend it for those that don't currently have similar protection."
"This is a great help for fine hair, I've used it for three years and it really makes a difference !"
"I was very pleased with this product. It a very accurate representation of the color displayed on the site. Also, it is very difficult to find similar item in a retail store Finally, cam when it was estimated"
"For over 10 years I used TurboTax Deluxe for my personal and small business federal and state tax returns. This year Intuit makes you buy this much costlier version because they took the Schedule C and Depreciation functions out of TT Deluxe.  This was a PR disaster for them, so they are offering a $25 refund if you used to use TT Deluxe and had to upgrade to TT Home and Business or Premier this year. The only catch is that you must file your federal return by April 20 or no refund. More motivation to file on time.  I've always been comfortable using TurboTax to figure my taxes. For a small extra charge they offer audit insurance too. I took off 2 stars for TT forcing us to use this more costly version."
"This game begins with you, as Nancy Drew, invited by the Hardy Boys to solve a strange 100 year old mystery: What happened to Jake Hurley? Lori Girard, a wannabe actress who will do anything for attention, invited a world-known detective, a television star, a romance novelist, and the Hardy Boys to help discover anything that will lead to Jake Hurley's mine, which no one ever found. But when Lori mysteriously disappears, the real personalities of these people come out. Nancy Drew, with the help of the Hardy Boys, discovers the real reason why one passenger wanted to find Jake Hurley's abandoned mine.

Overall, it was fun to play, but hard to follow the story, which surprised me because usually HerInteractive does a very nice job with the story. The game was not overly easy, but not overly difficult either. I found my self going online only twice for help. And, as always, the graphics and the music is amazing! Another great job HerInteractive! 5 Stars!"
"Real good to Download music on your tablet and phone and computer,"
"Virus protection, safe-browsing, firewall, etc.
All the usual things you expect from a big-name anti-virus software.

I've used Norton, McAfee, Microsoft, AVG, Kaspersky, and some little brands I don't remember.
They've all been pretty comparable, but I've been fortunate enough to avoid major infections, so I can't speak to how they handle big attacks.

The only significant differences I've noticed in any of them had nothing to do with performance.
Primarily, it's things like the user-interface and usability that sets one apart from the other.

This was the first time I'd ever installed McAfee without a disk.
I received the usual-sized box, but was surprised that all it contained was a one-page instruction sheet and a card with the software key.
You must download the installer from McAfee.
This was great for my skinny laptop which has no optical drive, and for the HTPC which inside a locked media center.
This would be inconvenient if your internet is unsteady or slow.

In my case, install went well. It doesn't slow my system down. UI is intuitive.

Don't bother buying the PC/Mac option. They're just going to mail you a software code in a box. Just buy one of the Online Code options and have your code instantly, rather than waiting for delivery."
"I did my research on this product and found it to be exactly what I was looking for. I have run out of space for additional cards on my system and this card combines USB 2.0, Firewire, and RJ45 onto one card. Great card and Amazon had the best price that I could find online."
what's not to like about sephora
Great for widows 10
good travel ideas and recipes.
"There are many antivirus options out there, but avast! continues to lead the pack as the best FREE offering, followed by AVG and a few others. I picked up this download for a PC that had a paid antivirus software subscription that had run out.

 Installation was quick and easy, and the software runs quietly in the background - not really taking up any system resources. You do need to read carefully during the process however, to uncheck certain things to prevent them from being installed on your system. (Toolbar, etc... is offered, but you just make sure it's deselected and all's well.)

This product in combination with the free version of Malwarebytes, makes for a wonderful alternative to McAfee, Norton and others for basic PC protection against virus'.  While it's not as full featured as some security suites, it's very good at what it does and you can't beat the price."
"Update: 01 April 2012.

Writer first, page designer second, graphic artist third. Realistic human shapes and postures give me the most trouble, so when Poser 9 came down the Vine, I decided to see if it could help me set scenes for book covers and interiors. As it turns out, Poser is a powerful program with a great deal of plug-in and model support, albeit with a lot of features and nuances to learn. It also demands a current system to run smoothly.

--Enter the Program--

Installation was uneventful. Poser 9 comes in Mac and Windows flavor on a single disc, 32-bit only. Including the 3 gigabytes of model content, it clocks in over 4 gigs total on my hardrive. Smaller than many of my modern games, I can tell you.

Once it comes up, I get a touch overwhelmed by the layout. Controls are not quite as intuitive as they could be, and even with helpful dials and knobs and icons, they don't always go quite the directions I would expect. Models don't follow a standard for labeling their controls, so what makes a pair of nunchucks move one way, will make a pair of handcuffs move a different way when turning the same dial.

Camera controls are typical for a 3D editing program, which is to say that you cannot simply mouse around the models and their stage, but must use keyboard and GUI controls. The same goes for moving props around. You don't simply load things in and have it snap to your model. A lot of camera movement, dial spinning, and menu commands are required. Also, Poser 9 kicks off with minimal defaults. So if you want your models to have realistic bone constraints, instead of being tugged around like a Gumby doll, you'll have to go in and check off the option. Finally, there are a lot of meshes and magnets and constraints and scattering surfaces and other tools to master for the final look. I haven't tried the animation features yet, but the program allows you to render still images which can be exported to a variety of contone formats, including the popular PNG, TIF, BMP, and JPG. These renders look good even on the default setting; however, colors that aren't apparant in the posing window will appear in the render, so you might have to switch back and forth for adjustments.

Once you get the hang of the control nuances, things move quickly enough. The dials turn out to be a good way for posing of limbs and digits, while the mouse works the user interface and moving whole models around. The presets and bundled content are accessible enough to learn, and there is a lot of free stuff on the net to explore. Which leads me to...

--DAZed and Compatible--

One of the first things I did with Poser was to install models from Daz Studio. Victoria 4 and Michael 4 are two of the latter's most popular characters. To go with that popularity are hundreds of hair, clothing, and gadget accessories (many of them costing in excess of $29 a pop). Hair alone is a racket. So when 3D Daz had a promotional giveaway for the base package of both figures, I installed them. Additionally, I've downloaded dozens of props and stages designed for Poser, Daz, or both, from 3D Daz, Renderosity, and various other vendors. Poser 9 allows you to access the Smith Micro Store from within the program. I did not attempt to load Genesis, which are the newest figure series, and which I am told are not compatible with Poser 9 without work around.

Speaking of workarounds, Poser object installation is mostly straight forward. When you launch the executable for a given model, make sure you select it as a Daz Studio item when the dialogue box asks you to chose. Then in the next dialogue box, install it to your root Poser Content folder (installed by default in My Documents on Windows 7) instead of Daz--NOT to Poser's actual runtime directory. Finally, the very first time you install a model, you have to go into Poser itself, and tell it to recognize its own Content folder. Also, you have to restart Poser for them to be recognized. This is easier than it sounds, and instructions are also available on vendor sites.

--Poser Performance--

I tested this program on a five-year old HP media center PC, with a Core 2 Duo E6600 processor, four gigs of RAM, and a 250GB platter drive at 3 Gigabit/s transfer speed. Run on Windows 7 Home Premium.

It works in default settings, but definitely moves sluggishly. Even small props take several seconds to load, and textures may be delayed by an additional few seconds. Moving the models around can bring a touch of stutter if you have a room loaded and there are a number of lighting or particle effects in the scene. The program also crashed on me a couple times, which I suspect has more to do with system limitations than the software.

Since then, I've used the program for work on a custom Intel machine with a i5-2500, DZ68 mobo, 8 GBs of 1600 mhz RAM, and a Radeon HD6850. I boot the app off a Crucial M4 solid state drive, and store the content on a WD Caviar Black platter drive--both SATA III. Booting is initally slow, but after a few sessions the cache catches up and it loads just a little slower than my Adobe apps. Models can be moved smoothly, scenes render faster, and there is much less texture popping.

On that note, 64-bit processors have been commercially available for a few years now, and anybody who seriously uses Poser is going to have more than 4 gigs of RAM. So it would be helpful to have an x64 bit version of the software. While some Operating Systems can allocate more to their 32-bit programs, Windows usually caps them at about 3.2 - 3.4 GBs.

--Applause--

Overall, Poser 9 is more of a ""prosumer"" product than something for beginners or hobbyists. For the latter crowd I'd consider the Debut version of the program before sinking your cash into this one. Yet it's accessibility and utility is scalable, from simple still poses to animation. It can also support a great deal of Daz Studio content in addition to the library of Poser material already available on the web, some of it free and some of it spendy. The lack of 64 bit support and a GUI that could be a little more friendly for me keep it from five stars. Neither of those are reasons to pass this program up.

Pending Update: comparison to Daz Studio Pro."
"ESPN magazine is good for skim reading. If you are looking for in-depth articles that present new ideas then look towards Sports Illustrated. ESPN magazine features many short articles about current, and upcoming events in sports. Most of the content in each issues can be written by a couple of interns, but within each issue are one or two lengthy article that maybe worth reading. Otherwise, this magazine is great to read in the bathroom, or during breakfast. I subscribed ESPN magazine because I wanted a cheap magazine that provided an overview into sports. For those more serious about sports, upgrade and spend the extra money on Sports Illustrated.

Pros
- Cheap
- ESPN Insider

Cons
- Articles lack quality
- Many Ads"
"Yeah I know, this is an old version of the software from back in 2010. I purchased this to install on a Windows 7 computer from that same year. I figured that this older version of VideoStudio would work better and have less conflicts than if I bought the latest and greatest made for Windows 10. Anyway, all I plan on using this for is to make some video slideshows of pictures - so even this old package is a bit of overkill for doing that. Software works fine and I'm happy with it."
"Friends with Kindles love this. I did not realize how many people buy various things from Amazon!!!! Next year, I will probably up this one.  Wonderful for Kindle users as well."
"I have been using Pinnacle Studio for several years. I started with version 8 and have versions 9 ,11, 12, and now 17. the past versions of this software are much more user friendly that this current version. the designers have changed the interface and it is much harder to navigate. the product works OK, but having used the studio software for about 10 years and several versions I found it like starting all over again.

I can' help but wonder if the designers used to work for Microsoft and just feel they need to change things without making them better.  I am still a fan of Pinnacle Studio and think it is a fine product.  I just haven't found the improvements yet."
"I used Norton AntiVirus for over 10 years and finally got tired of the way it slowed down my PC. Switched to PC-cillin and it's like having a new computer.

There are better firewall, spam blocker, and spyware programs out there, but this is the best antivirus program, in my opinion.

Try it. You'll like it!"
"Love this magazine! Great articles about the chefs and about food network. I look forward to the recipes each month and the opportunity to try new foods and new food combinations. I also like learning about restaurants throughout US.
Great magazine for any cook or chef of any level."
"I happen to already have a subscription to Ancestry.com and periodically work on a tree that I created there, so I was already familiar with the main features of this program and found it easy to operate.  To a person new to the program, though, I think that there would be a bit of a learning curve, simply because of the volume and variety of data the program has to work with.

I was able to import my current Ancestry.com tree into Family Tree Maker without a problem.

This type of program can become highly addictive, especially since you get the three months of access to Ancestry.com and you soon realize that the amount of information out there is vast.  You'll find yourself meandering down a side shoot of your family, trying to track it as far as you can.  The difficulty I have, though, with the search program is due to the fact that most of my folks came over from Eastern Europe and the translations of the Cyrillic alphabet into the English one varies from document to document, so their names and addresses aren't always spelled the same.  But if your ancestors are from Western Europe, your search will be much easier.  I've managed to track an English ancestor back into the 1700's.

This review is about an older version of the program which is no longer available, but if you're at all interested in your family history, I would highly recommend getting a current version of the program."
"A very well designed software tool for the creative folks out there.  This product fits a niche that I imagine many of were looking for.  For many if not all of us, we start off our ideas with sketching.  It only seems natural for that to graduate towards being digital.  Sure we'll still doodle on napkins and receipts, but our real design efforts can be more readily imagined at our desktops.  It features a wealth of options with the brushes without overdoing or overloading our workspace, which we can better refine if we need it in other applications."
"I know, giving a product one star because it fails at one feature that not every user needs may seem unfair.  But everyone knows Amazon's rating system is utterly subjective -- and for me, this one failing on the part of Quicken Deluxe 2011 is extremely annoying and devastating.

I had been using Money 2006 for several years.  As everyone knows, that product line was discontinued due to lack of demand.  I decided to get Quicken Deluxe 2011, which promised Money file compatibility.  While waiting for Quicken to arrive from Amazon, I uninstalled Money 2006 to reclaim some disk space.

To my great distress, I discovered, upon launching Quicken, that Money must be present on the system for Quicken to import the Money file!  According to the dialog box, ""Microsoft Money 2007 or 2008 must be installed on your computer before we can import your Money file.""  Okay, so maybe Money 2006 wouldn't even have worked, so it probably wouldn't have made a difference in my case.  But this is just absolutely ridiculous.  My Money file has no password protection, and I just don't see why Money is required to be installed for Quicken to read the file.

So I decided to give Quicken a spin anyway to see if it was worth my time to start from scratch.  When I clicked on that big ""Get Started"" button, Quicken started downloading an updated financial institution list.  After 10 minutes, it was still doing the same (the status indicator was simply moronic and indicated little).  I stopped out of that, and clicked ""Get Started"" again, this time Quicken began downloading a program update, but then nothing happened.  At this point, I decided to write up this review.

One other thing I also noticed is, after I ran Quicken for the first time, my quad-core PC, which had always been zippy and extremely responsive in everything, has begun to show some random slowdowns, which reminded me of the days when I ran Symantec's awful Norton Anti-Virus software.  I really wonder if Intuit installed some background services that have a significantly negative impact on my otherwise optimized system (Win 7 64-bit).

As you can see, my getting-started experience with Quicken Deluxe 2011 has been entirely negative.  I regret having wasted almost 40 bucks on a competely useless program."
Works great and can't beat the price!!
:)
"If Quicken 2011 is anything like Quicken 2010 it runs like a 7th grade science project. It misses transactions, the interface is confusing, the screens are amazingly amateurish, account lists take several tries to assemble themselves. I could go on, but any of you who own the program, know what I'm talking about. With the loss of Microsoft Money, Quicken is the ""last man standing"". Too bad that man is walking wounded."
Bought this for my niece during holidays.  Her mother was very grateful for this as it helped keep her busy being out of school for 2 weeks.
"I love taking pictures with my digital camera and enjoy sharing them with family and friends. Paintshop ProX5 allows me to organize and edit my pictures as well as to share them with family and friends.

It is important for me to have an easy to use photo editing software.  This software is easy enough for someone like me to use but has features that an advanced user would enjoy.

There are three tabs at the top of the screen that help a person use the software.  The tabs are manage, adjust and edit.

The manage tab deals with organizing photos, identifying them and rating them.  The adjust tab allows you to use a lot of different features to adjust the sharpness, tone, brightness and contrast of a picture. The edit tab allows you to edit photos in more ways than I care to list.  There is an adjust option in the edit tab that allows a person to use many of the features in the adjust tab.

I have yet to use the adjust and edit features completely but I could see a professional being able to do very complicated tasks. The help menu is great and there are ways to do quick fixes which allow the software to fix up a picture for you.  I have had this software for a couple of months and am still learning all that I can do.

Paintshop ProX5 has helped me to better organize my photos. More importantly, I have been able to make okay pictures into really nice ones."
"Ok, does not come every month."
Perfect for me! right near me and love their products
"It works simply, effectively in the background.  I don't have any of the annoying problems that I have had with Norton and McAfee.  Since I have not had any viruses or other attacks, I can only assume that it is doing its job well.

Recommended."
"I haven't installed this yet but all the other times I've used it, it worked great."
Like them haven't use them yet
"Year in, year out, this product works well.  I am glad I switched to this brand and intend to stay with it for years to come."
It didn't do much that my PC cleaner was already doing. I removed it from my system.
"I've run several small businesses (sole proprietorships), doing my own accounting and tax preparation for well over 20 years. I've expanded into a new business that includes a number of not-quite-employees, people I pay commissions to and need to 1099 at the end of the year. I also now have inventory to track. Enter the need for better accounting software to handle these added tracking issues without taking up too much of my time.

QuickBooks in the name to look toward for just such accounting needs... But starting from zero, with no previous QuickBooks knowledge, I'm finding it a steep climb to learn and use, and a time-consuming one at that. It is not an easy or intuitive start-up program to use.

Odd thing that strikes me, that may not bother those more familiar with the program, is the lack of ability to simply enter expenses and in a simple ""expense"" area, and tag them with the IRS standard categories I'll be entering for taxes at year's end. Instead this sort of entry seems to fall under ""vendors."" It seems to me a cumbersome way to go about what should be a simple entry, for example, for office supplies, whether I happen to buy printer paper at the grocery store or make a special trip to the office supply store.

I found window tabs and window resizing to fit my notebook computer cumbersome and sometimes difficult. The registration and setup process - while I had no major problems - did at points cause me difficulty because some popup windows had no scroll bars and ran off the bottom of my notebook screen, so I couldn't get to the ""submit"" buttons.

I was disappointed to be confronted immediately by it wanting a credit card to use the payroll part. I want to try things out and evaluate before committing to paying for upgrades. Without the credit card entered, with automatic renewals, I couldn't look at the employee payroll thing to see if it fit my needs, or if the cost to do 4 to 6 employees (who aren't really even 'employees') made it worthwhile.

Point to QuickBooks for having a ""Help"" section with writing in words, not just videos (they have videos, too). I HATE having to watch several minutes of videos only to learn it didn't answer my question (I just tried and rejected another accounting software service primarily because their help was *only* videos). But the help windows are tiny and do not resize, and the font is tiny, hard to read, and does not resize unless I resize my entire computer display sizing (really? for one program that lacks suitable adaptive ability?).

I'll keep working on it all, hoping familiarity creates a better reaction."

Haven't got one for a while it is 12 issues missing quite a few but really love it she is only received four of them.
"This maximum security spyware assures security against hijacking and identity theft. It also protects against viruses and worms and blocks malware and phishing sites.
It doesn't slow down the computer.
The reasonable price for this protection should also be considered.
I found it easy to install and use.
Highly recommended."
I find this magazine really helpful.  I have corrected some of my eating habits and was encourage to do some exercise.  Every home should have this magazine.
I have filed with no problems.  It comes with deduction pro which helps if you choose to itemize.  Tax updates are free of charge.
"Love  the scent and it work better than any other mousse I have used. it makes my hair look natural, not stiff. My hair is shinier and fuller. Great stuff."
"This program has problems syncing with mobile devices. Calendar appointments disappear in the transfer. If you do serious business you don't want to depend on this program. Earlier versions worked better. Stay with them. Outlook 2007 works much better.

Update: Found a solution for syncing problem. When you make a recurring appointment limit it to set number of occurances. Do not use ""no end date."""
"Upgraded from Quicken 2007 because that version supposedly doesn't work with Windows 7.  This new 2010 version seems to work fine -- more stable than 2007 with the large data file I have.  And the user interface has been polished a bit here and there.  But there's really nothing new enough to warrant the price they charge for new versions.

I'd be more inclined to get new versions more often, if the upgrade price was cheaper, say $15.  Being a loyal user for years doesn't really get you any special deals, which is unfortunate."
Easiest way to get birthday gifts for family and friends.
"I ordered Norton 360, to be honest, because the price was right.
I expected the usual problems that used to be common with Norton products; you know, blue screens and jam-ups, intrusive scans, cumbersome programming and no relief.
Instead, I found that the new Norton 360 provides a safe and secure internet surfing and banking environment and it is very user-friendly and intuitive.
Norton 360 remains quietly in the background and never intrudes unless invited to do so; it also provides an excellent Norton Security website interface, online diagnostic tools and ""last resort"" fall back defense scans to find and destroy hidden viruses.
Buy it, you'll love it!"
"Tried upgrading from 2005 to 2006, but the activation screen would always freeze before the program could connect to verify. Problem appears to happen quite often when I searched around, but other than making sure all appropriate services and programs were running (and they were) there was no solution. Updating via LIveupdate did not help.

EVEN WORSE... when I went back to 2005 the same thing happened, so now both Norton AV 2005 and Norton AV 2006 are useless.

Support has been no help.

This is a product to stay away from!"
I have used this for many years.  It is great.
"I have used H&R Block Tax Cut Deluxe for at least 15 years and have been content with it. I would give it five stars if not for ONE major issue - which may affect many people in the mid-Atlantic States. It will affect you if you live in one state and work in another. That is because H&R Block Deluxe gives you ONE state return. You can PURCHASE additional states at the ridiculous price of $39.95 per state. This is more than the Deluxe (Fed and Stare sells for). So, be aware of that so you won't get any surprises.  Also be advised that the software provides for free efiling for FEDERAL but there is a charge to efile your State Return.

When they charged $19.95 for any state over one, I was giving them 5 stars. But now that they have gotten greedy, I've lowered it to four stars.

I hope you found this information helpful.

"Installed this on my home server system (Dell Dimensions AMD X2-6000 with XP Media Center with 2GB RAM / 1TB HD).  I followed all the directions carefully by having previous antiviral software removed and rebooted.  Then proceeded with the install of this product.  The install went smoothly and almost finished.  Then I assume the program started and my system rebooted (I've disabled blue screens for reboots).  I thought okay, should be fine on the reboot.  Well the system rebooted and windows started loading but then it would reach a point where the system errored again and reboot.  Pattern was infinite, I powered down and powered back on with the same pattern.

Omigod I thought, this is terrible.  Apparently this program is causing a catastrophic error to the point I can't even get windows to complete loading.  So I decide it's best to boot into safemode to remove the program.  Should be easy.  Got into safemode and loaded the uninstall control panel.  Clicked to uninstall.  Wouldn't let me.  It tells me this particular vendor's installer cannot be uninstalled under safe mode. Ridiculous!  What kind of idiot makes an installer do this?  I kept trying to no avail.  I was starting to panic thinking my system was hosed by this commercial virus (that's what a virus does).  Fortunately, I was able to roll back to the last known good configuration which prevented this program from loading.

Horrible installer for this program.  Haven't seen anything like this in ages and to think this is commercial software?  Crazy.  My home server is very stable by the way, with minimal software and runs without fault for weeks, even months at a time.  I refuse to go through this pattern of insanity, plus wasting hours of my time, just to install it on another PC to see how it works.  Beware."
I loved it
"Unlike some other reviewers, I had absolutely no problems installing this version of Norton 360. It uninstalled BitDefender and cleanly installed itself. Installation was clean and simple and in default mode it will adequately protect you from the scourges of the Internet.

I did notice some system lag, especially when checking outgoing emails with attachments (and not even very large ones). Otherwise it works quietly in the background. If you so desire you can tweak the settings to your liking.

Overall, you can't go wrong with this tried-and-true software. And with three licenses can protect your other devices as well."
Awesome magazine! Wished they did 12 mags a year :(
"Ive used Turbo Tax until last year. I thought for the price I would take a chance on Tax Cut. It was after all a substantial price difference.

Right away I though the learning curve for TaxCut was a little steeper & it seemed I had to actually do some thinking when it was asking me questions. (Oh Darn!) The phraseology was slightly confusing but not overwhelming.

However, I got through it, the return was correct & it wasn't so difficult that I will go back to TT next year. I think TT is a better product that seems to have been thought out more, but that could be that TT has been around for much longer, I believe. Turbo Tax is far more expensive but I don't think the benefits of TT ( at least in my case ) justify the extra cost.
As far as the e-file, I have never used it & don't really care about that.
I just need a sensible guide to doing my senseless tax forms & Tax Cut was a great help & worth the minimal cost."
"I needed a Wireless N PCMCIA adapter for my older laptop.  There are not many low price adapters on the market, so I went ahead and ordered this one.  It works great!  Easy to install.  Excellent reception.
This product was delivered on time and was brand new when I received it."
"I put this product on my brother's 5 year old Windows XP laptop after his system appeared to catch a virus using AVG free and so far this product has been running great without any complaints from my brother. After a couple of months, he decided to go ahead and proactively replace AVG free on his netbook.  Since this includes a 3 user license he was able to do so without buying a new license.

I did a bit of a speed comparison of bootup time for before and after installation and I didn't notice any significant difference, which is good.  In looking at professional reviews, it has received good results for virus and malware protection."
"I've been using TurboTax and Quicken for many years and with each new version I buy, I edge closer to looking at the competition. This year's TurboTax is probably pushing me over the line.

  First, I truly hate the endless in-your-face advertising for other Intuit products. I am buying a software product and paying a healthy price for the usability of the software - not to have an endless stream of ads for other Intuit products shoved in my face.

  Secondly, TurboTax's help system is just plain awful. This is the first year I received Social Security payments - and I had questions about their taxability. I had to go through three layers of help menus before winding up with an official IRS publication. Why have three layers of superfluous inapplicable information?

  Intuit pushes a lot of the burden online for help, which is not the most efficient - or helpful - facility to use.

  Picking up your last year's tax return as a starting point for the current year is not a wise move. Better to start from scratch.

  The ""guided interview"" is ridiculous. A one size fits all approach wastes a lot of your time.

  Overall, I think this is my last year of not considering alternatives to TurboTax. Intuit has done a lot of rotten things to its customers. A few years back, they implemented a copy protection scheme that could cripple your computer. This year they implemented an outlandish charge for printing alternate returns. On both occasions, Intuit backed down with an explanation that they ""blundered"" - but not before trying to rip off their customers.

  Hopefully there is an equivalent or better product out there because I am fed up with TurboTax and its arrogance toward its customers.

"With each passing Nancy Drew game, the games have gotten better. In the past three alone, they've gone from containing great plots with terrible gaming quality (Secrets Can Kill) to awesome plots with incredible gaming quality (Message in a Haunted Mansion). Treasure in the Royal Tower is no exception, and definitely the best Nancy Drew game to the date of its release.

Nancy is currently attempting to have some relaxing fun at a ski lodge called Wickford Castle in Butter Ridge, Wisconsin. Shortly after unpacking in her room, she goes downstairs to talk to the caretaker of the lodge. He informs her that Wickford's historic library has been vandalized, and is now off limits. Not only that, but another guest has reported a robbery in her room recently. Nancy decides to sneak around the castle to discover what's going on, only to discover that one of the towers at Wickford Castle was imported from France many years ago, and could hold a precious treasure that once belonged to Marie Antoinette herself. It's now up to Nancy to find this treasure before a would-be thief does...

This is probably the strongest plot to appear in a Nancy Drew game at the time of Treasure in the Royal Tower's release. I loved the setting, and the use of actual events and figures in history was an awesome idea. I learned quite a bit about Marie's character while playing the game, and reading some fictional documents that were written by her (""fictional"" meaning they were fictional, but real in this fictional game) really made me curious as to what kind of woman and queen she truly was. The game itself isn't all that scary, but since the past three were, it's good to have one in which the scare factor was a little ""toned down"" (if they were all scary, then it'd get boring after awhile).

Like the previous game, this game does have a few chores that need to be done, but they're very well-integrated into the game and don't get in the way of sleuthing. Nancy actually spends the vast majority of the game sneaking into hidden passageways, questioning suspects, and looking through confidential areas.

While the graphics do show their age on occasion, they're absolutely phenomenal regardless. I was in awe of the beauty and detail of the castle at times. The explorable areas outside were also very nicely detailed, especially the beautiful garden (covered in snow at the time of Nancy's exploration). I won't say too much for the sake of spoiling this for those who have not played, but my favorite spot of all was the place in which Nancy finds what she and the culprit have been searching for. It was so beautifully detailed, and I could really feel all the awe that a real-life Nancy probably would have felt upon entering this hidden area.

The cast in this game was definitely stronger than the casts in the previous three (though the last one does follow very closely). The first suspect mentioned is Dexter Egan, Wickford Castle's elderly caretaker who seems to know more about the history surrounding the castle than he's admitting. He's currently trying to take care of all the issues going on singlehandedly while the owner is away on business, and believes that the culprit must be somebody else in the castle. Lisa Ostrum is a photojournalist who enjoys gossiping and being buddy-buddy with Nancy, and tells Nancy that she'd like to explore Marie's tower to find out more about the history hidden beyond the castle walls. Jacques Brunais is the handsome French ski instructor at the castle who's currently engaged to an American woman and seems to hold a very special passion for French history.  Professor Beatrice Hotchkiss is an eccentric woman who spends almost all of her time typing in her room, doing research and writing out what she calls her ""theory"" (she is also the guest who claims to have been robbed).

Like the last game, this game also should be praised for the perfect choice of the culprit in the end. All four of the characters had great motives, and all of them had enough evidence pointing toward them to make me suspect them at times. However, as the loose ends are gradually tied together and the story comes to an exciting end, only one particular suspect could logically be behind all of this. The culprit's character was fantastic, and he/she is definitely one of the cruelest villains that Nancy Drew has ever faced.

The game's musical score is very nicely done. Music heard while exploring the hallways was super catchy, and definitely added to the overall ""castle"" feel in the game (in the sense that it sounded very stereotypically ""royal"", for lack of better terms). The music occasionally got a little scarier while Nancy was exploring dark passageways or in the face of danger which could cost her life if she isn't fast enough to find a way out. There wasn't a track out of place, if you ask me.

While the previous game is a close runner-up, ""Treasure in the Royal Tower"" was definitely the best Nancy Drew game at the time of its release. Some would even say that it's still the best to date, and it remains in the top three as of the release of the Collector's Edition Fan Favorites packaging (along with ""The Secret of Shadow Ranch"" and ""Curse of Blackmoor Manor"". Between the rich sense of history, awesome casting, wonderfully detailed settings, and great soundtrack, this surely remains one of Nan's most memorable cases to date. Love it or hate it, you won't forget it."
"Snow Leopard is the latest OS X version and is an excellent upgrade, given its bargain price.  This is a revamped Leopard and not a totally new operating system, but succeeds at improving on already great features. There are software compatibility problems, so it may pay to wait a month or so before upgrading to avoid the annoyance of non-working software.

The installation couldn't have been more smooth--you basically put in the DVD, hit install, and the OS installs itself.  Unlike every other version of Microsoft Windows, the machine doesn't have to reboot multiple times and Snow Leopard doesn't require any user input until after it reboots into itself.

The OS offers a nice tweak on OS X's usual features.  There are also a lot of 'under the hood' improvements that take full advantage of 64 bit processing and others that make life easier for software developers.  Apple's description above tells you about most of the improvements, so I won't reiterate that here.  The ones that really shine for me in everyday use are the improved 'stacks' features in the dock, incredible improvements in Expose, expanded 'Quick look' capabilities,faster start up, faster backups with time machine, and Microsoft exchange capabilities in Mail.  Overall, the computer seems to work faster.  In particular, video processing in iMovie and iDVD seem to have gained some more speed.  I have a lot of pictures on iPhoto and before Snow Leopard there was a lot of lag when starting iPhoto up.  Now starting iPhoto is much snappier.

As many reviewers have pointed out, there's no 'killer' application here and this is less of a new operating system and more of an upgrade on the existing system.  But the price is right and the features really do make the most pleasant to use OS out there even better.

Alas, all is not wine and roses.  There are now internet lists of compatibility problems with software.  If you want to run older software, you have to install Rosetta (now a separate installation).  My biggest annoyance was Microsoft Office 2008: once I upgraded, none of the components would load.  Uncharacteristically for an Apple, the program just hung in the air and would not respond, necessitating a force quit.  After a couple of days and no Microsoft patches in sight, I canvassed the net.  This was a 'font loading' problem.  What I had to do was verify all the fonts in fontbook and remove the offending ones.  I then had to restore them so that Microsoft Office would print in something other than symbol fonts.

This was not an insurmountable problem, but was the first time in three years of owning a Mac that I had any problems whatsoever. Obviously, Microsoft Office is a third party program and you can't fault Apple completely for compatibility issues.  Even so, lack of Office if you rely on it can make your life miserable. (Kudos to NeoOffice/OpenOffice, their program worked without a hitch.  So did iWork, for the record, but this is an Apple product.) My guess would be that this kind of problem will occur less and less as developers realize that such problems are occurring.  Most problems can be preemptively solved by upgrading all your software before installing Leopard.

The folks at Mac most likely released this OS as a preemptive strike against the onslaught of Microsoft's latest system, Windows 7.  Having played with the Windows 7 release candidate, I don't think that Apple has much to fear.  Windows 7 is a vast improvement over Vista, in my opinion, but it won't win over the OS X faithful.  And given the economy, the vast majority of users and companies will stick to the more ubiquitous Windows systems rather than buying new hardware.  (My guess is that Windows 7 will be competing more with other versions of itself rather than OS X or Linux for market share.)  Even so, Apple probably wanted to keep its cutting-edge image alive.

Snow Leopard is well worth the price of admission.  As above, I would recommend waiting a week or two before installing it so that the 3rd party vendors have time to eliminate the compatibility problems."
"This is the 3rd Edition of PowerDirector I've used and the basic tools and layouts are essentially the same as previous versions.  If you're comfortable with the old version, you should feel at home here.  There aren't a lot of new features but there is a marked improvement in performance.  I was able to work with high definition video without downsampling and it ran smoothly in the advanced editor.  Start up and applied effects are also faster as well as shorter render times with 64 bit performance.  If you use PowerDirector frequently the price of the upgrade is worth it in terms of performance enhancements.

That having been said I would like to see the program being able to detect frame rate in your videos automatically and suggest render settings that are best for specific websites."
"I am yet to put it tru its paces but so far no problems, no freezes"
"The product is good, but the customer service from Corel is terrible. Strongly recommend looking for a different product for your needs. Amazon sells many different products to take care of needs. Shop around, don't spend your hard earned money on this product. You will need customer service and Corel currently policy is focused on sales, not retaining customers."
"Convenient. Bought all my gift cards for the holiday in one swoop. I'm a Prime member, so I got in 2 days. Being I work long hours, Amazon makes shopping convenient for me."
"I purchased this software, after reading reviews that spoke highly of it. After installing it with no problems, I noticed the computer slowed down to a point, where the mouse pointer would not move.  After I noticed that the files were done downloading, the cursor would then resume moving. I also noticed that the bootup time was extended from any other software I had used, excluding the Junk software from Norton *which either blue screened or crashed the computer*.

The antivirus worked fine, but everything else was slow. The firewall would not work with my home network or my print server, so I had to eliminate that Pc-Cillin firewall from the installed software. I had tried repeated attempts with their tech services to no avail, actually a waste of my time.  They would advise me to do minor adjustments, even after I just got done telling them I had already did the adjustments. I spoke to 2 people, and they both spoke at a below layman type language, which amused me, since I actually seemed to know more than them.

I uninstalled this software and went back to Computer Associates EZ Antivirus 2005 and Sygate. Both work great and both hold up well against the many firewall and antivirus tests I have thrown at them.

Pc Cillin has found a new home, its the trash can!"
Really nice so far. Only saw one issue but lots of nice pics and inspiration.
I've used TurboTax from many years now and have had zero problems. Great product and easy to use interface.
I bought my Amazon gift cards online this time because of the boxes they come in. Good deal and lots of boxes to choose from. Thanks! Will buy again online.
"I've had issues with Corel products in the past: I've aways WANTED to like them, but they've always somehow missed the mark. VideoStudio Pro, though, I like quite a bit.

It walks a fine line quite well, packing in a ton of prosumer-level features like excellent stop-motion, motion tracking, variable speed controls and HTML5 support while staying fairly straightforward and easy to learn. So beginners can jump right in and make movies without fear of outgrowing the package too quickly.

I found the interface fairly clean and easy to navigate, though there were moments when it didn't seem entirely intuitive. However, given the flexibility that VideoStudio Pro offers, this is really not a complaint as much as an observation; there has to be give and take to find balance here. You work in one of three modes: capture, edit, or share - I like this approach, as it keeps everything quite clear for beginners and more advanced users alike.

VideoStudio easily handles pretty much any format I've thrown at it, and it can even work with Ultra HD-4K, something that competing products in this price range cannot (good news for GoPro Hero3 Black owners!).

Clip organization is mediocre: a lack of tagging can hobble users' ability to easily find what they're looking for, but the rest of the package is quite good. Editing can be done in a basic drag-and-drop style for those looking to get something together quickly and easily, but far more advanced editing is available when you need it. Overall, I prefer the VideoStudio editing experience to Sony Vegas Platinum's.

I personally dislike most transitions, but if you're NOT like me you'll be psyched: there are a ton of them. A really nice selection of effects is available as well (some work better than others, as one might expect), though an upgrade to VideoStudio Ultimate X6 nets a few more that approach real pro quality; the price difference is only a couple of bucks and I'd recommend looking at it.

As I said, I think Corel has struck a great balance here. Beginners can jump in and start editing quickly, while more advanced users can stretch their legs and do some very advanced things. If your budget is under a hundred bucks for a video editing package and you want something that you won't hit the limits of too quickly (particularly if you're able to shoot in 4K), it's tough to go wrong with VideoStudio Pro X6."
"Had no major issues with the software.  Was able to use it on several devices, a couple computers, laptop and cell phone.  I would recommend Norton.  I like to fact that besides Antivirus, it also comes with antispam and antimalware."
"This is probably the WORST version of QuickBooks I've ever used in my life and I've been using QuickBooks since the 90s.  The layout is atrocious, the stock reports are next to useless, and it crashes as if Intuit is a open-source startup!  I haven't experienced such poor quality from Intuit since they ""upgraded"" Quicken 6 (which was the last great version of that program by the way).  If you have an older copy, stick with it.  This is not a great upgrade.

ADDENDUM: It even gets worse! Not only does it behave like a version 1 program, it seems as if the developers have lived in a cave as UI design advanced through the 80s, 90s, and 2000s.  And I don't mean fancy widgets.  When I can't do something as simple as favorite a report THAT I AM LOOKING AT, there's something terribly wrong.  Even from the Memorized Report List, I can't favorite a report.  What I have to do is drill down to the section the report resides and THEN click the heart to favorite it.  Why did they even bother?

By the way this tedium is necessary because I can't simply create a generic Memorized Report that can be used GLOBALLY across companies!  Again, WHY?!?!  The concept of accounting is pretty simple: assets, liabilities, revenue, expense.  The memorized reports group according to those parameters but I can't create ONE memorized report that I can apply GLOBALLY.

The lack of foresight put into this software is ABSOLUTELY SHOCKING for a company that has existed for MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS!  How they outsurvived Meca Software is beyond me!"
"This is perfect in many ways, fragrant, light, and clean."
"A great alternative to Photoshop - does everything Photoshop does, even uses Photoshop plug-ins, only without the Photoshop price gouging.

This new version is 64 bit.  Great, but for some reason, this 64-bit software still takes forever to load and still shows sluggishness in various areas of the app, like pulldown menus, etc, even on a ultra hot system with SSD drives.  Still trying to figure that out.  Must be written in the clunkiest, most bloated software development product ever devised by mankind, Microsoft Visual Studio.  That would explain everything."
"VideoStudio Pro X2 is enigmatic program.  It is an easy to use video editor, with powerful editing tools often found in much more expensive programs. Tools such as:

- Editing Masks
- Graphic overlays
- Color correction & brightness
- White balance & tone adjustments (very useful for indoor photography)
- Video rotation
- Ability to add flash animations to your video
- Chroma key functions
- Surround sound mixing
- Stretching audio duration

From my tests and reading of the manual these functions seem to be relatively easy to use.  However, the quality of the program is always found in the production process and the final output.

To test VideoStudio Pro X2 I imported a 30 minute avi file and had VideoStudio segment this clip into segments.  Next, I placed these segments onto the storyboard and cut out a few unwanted clips at the start and end of video.  Next, I trimmed the opening and ending clips using the clip trim handles.  Finally, I applied an audio fade at the end of the video and burned the production to a dvd.  All of these functions worked perfectly and quickly on a Pentium 4, 3ghz machine with 3 gigabytes of ram.  Impressive!

However, VideoStudio does exhibit some unstable behavior upon exiting the program. VideoStudio has given me a couple error messages upon shutdown.  Strangely, neither of these error messages affected the editing and production process.  My guess is that VideoStudio is not fully releasing the memory it was occupying.

Corel is close to having a class defining video editor.  Hopefully, Corel will issue an update to fix some of the small but irritating bugs.

P.S. If you are looking for a slightly less powerful video editor that is even easier to use you might want to check out Serif's MoviePlus X3.  Both of these programs appear to be far more stable than my old Pinnacle Studio versions 8, 9 or 11."
"I can't say much more than I absolutely hate this software.  It crashes, it conflicts, it never behaves, and its off of my computer.  I have never had so many problems with a security software package as with this one, and after weeks of fighting with it, I gave up.  Its too complicated for a mid level user such as myself or something.  Security software should function in the background protecting my computer, with only occasional demands for adjustment, but this one is like a spoiled child demanding attention continually.

I don't recommend it."
Total TRASH!!!  Don't buy this unless you want headaches and virtually NO SUPPORT!!!
"There is a lot of functionality here, which makes it an acceptable program for photo editiing.  The menu is easy to access, and there are not very many mystery icons that force you to guess.  I can do all the basics like fix red eye, cut out portions of photos, airbrush, and easily sync and manage my pictures in one location.

It is far from perfect though.  The loading time is over 40 seconds, which is way too long for a mid-range photo editior program.  There are at some key functions missing.  I cannot resize images pieces that I've cut out, which my free Windows Paint program can do.  The image review carousel is also too small.  I have a 20 inch screen, and most of my images have to be viewed as a small thumbnails instead of midsized photos.

Fix these problems, and take out the spyware, and we will have a 5 star program."
So far have only received one copy of it. A lot of  nice pictures not much helpful reading material
Very happy i returned to Norton. I only hope the prices won't keep climbing and climbing.
Works great with no problems.
"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roxio-Toast-14-Titanium/dp/B0123C60F6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roxio Toast 14 Titanium</a>

I've used Roxio software on my PC for years so when I changed to Mac, Toast was a logical app for me to look at.  It's been the standard for years on the Mac.  While some Apple apps have the ability to write to CD/DVD, their capability is limited.  Toast is the most complete, do it all app for the Mac.

First, let's talk about what it can't do... copy commercial movie DVDs.  Toast will not copy DVDs that are copy protected (most commercial movie DVDs). While it may make a copy, it will be unplayable or unwatchable.

But, Toast does almost everything else you might want to do with making DVDs and CDs...  copying, making archive files (ISO, IMG, etc), authoring DVD (making menus,menu screens, adding backgrounds,etc).  It can also take videos and movies and optimize (compress) them for best performance on tablets and phones, upload them to social sites, and let you do light editing.  By light editing, I'm referring to taking clips and combining them.  For more comprehensive editing, you can use iMovie (free) or one of many commercial apps.  Toast also handles audio files.  It can read most file types and convert them if needed to other types.  It comes with a program that allows you to edit and clean up audio. While not as feature laden as some apps, it does most of the things you would need to do.

If you purchase this and are going to install it on a Mac running El Capitan (latest OS), my suggestion is not to use the DVD that came in the box.  The box I received had a slightly older version that has some issues with El Capitan.  Roxio allows you to download and install the app from their website. When you do that you get the latest version. It also makes installation on the newer MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs (no DVD drive) easy.

So far the software has performed well.  I only have 2 complaints... sometimes certain features are hard to find.  I wanted to save a DVD to an ISO file.  By default, Toasts save an image to it's own filetype.  It took me a while to find out how to save it to an ISO file.  It's not as intuitive as Roxio's PC software (Creator).  This was the case with a couple of things I tried to do.  I also had a problem once installing it.  I installed it when I first got it and everything went fine.  About a month later, I changed the drive in my Mac and reinstalled everything.  The only software that didn't work was Toast.  It activated and appeared to work, but would hang when I actually tried to write a file or DVD.  I uninstalled it and did a reinstall and it's been working fine... probably just an anomaly.  Toast does not have an uninstall option or program. However they have good instructions on their website.

Even with a few problems, I will continue to use Toast and see it as the best app of it's type for the Mac."
Superior magazine just wish that the magazine subscriptions manager would work.  Sent one to my husband and one to my son in Atlanta. We have received duplicate issues with my son's name but our address.  Keep trying to fix...  WHAT A HASSLE.
"Unfortunately, I'm going to have to give this product a negative review.  I have been unable, to date, to get it to install on my Dell laptop (Vista OS) via the disc provided.  I shut down all my security programs so that nothing would interfere with the installation, but it reaches a certain point and then just crashes.  I've been in touch with Acronis customer service and they provided me with a new, downloaded version of the program, but the same thing happened.  I am still in touch with customer service and am trying to figure out how to get the program to install, but right now it is useless to me.  If I ever do manage to get it working, I will come back and revise my review and rating."
Great shampoo.
"I have a very high end Mac Pro and bought Toast Titanium Pro in a bundle with an external Blu-Ray burner.  Every time I click the mouse in Toast, I get a spinning beach ball for 30 seconds.  I upgraded to the latest version of Toast.  This is a system with a very fast disk array and 24 GB of RAM.  Everything flies except for Toast.

Do not buy this or bundles with it; it's a total waste of money.

Update Nov 2010 -- Well, something changed or the newest version of Toast fixes the problem I was having.  In any event, I am finally able to use Toast to burn blu-ray discs."
Loved it
"JUST LOVE THIS VERSION AND USE IT EVERYDAY FOR MY PSP GROUPS!! I ALSO HAVE VERSIONS 9 10 AND X3!!

I've been using TurboTax for around 20 years. I like how it easily imports data from previous years and the walk-through interview as I'm compiling my return simplifies the process.  As long as the cost of TT remains reasonable I will continue using it.  I just wish the cost included Efile of the state return.  I'm too cheap to spend the additional $19.95 and so I spend 75-cents or so in postage and mail it in.
"Anime Studio Debut 8 was everything I expected and more! I'm new to animation and being a beginner I didn't know what to do or where to start but thanks to this program it was much easier than I thought! I'm a visual learner and the ""how to videos"" are a great help along with the beginner's packet.
Great product, perfect for beginners and easy to use."
"Great magazines for snobs, college students who wishes to become writers and/ or humorists. I maybe be a bit of a snob but I do enjoy this magazine for great reading and cartoons."
You just can't go wrong with a Starbucks gift card as a gift!!! I love to give them and I love to to receive them. We all love Starbucks. They have something for everyone.
Performed several upgrades from XP everything works as it should had zero issues.  If you know what your doing and follow simple on screen spoon fed instructions you too should have no issues.  Beware of apple fanboy reviews claiming it sucks unless they give very detailed reasons other than it sucks or nothing works etc.  Cheers!

"This soap smells absolutely wonderful. I could smell it as I was opening the box it was shipped in, not an overpowering fragrance, but an inviting one that made me want to unwrap it and go take a shower with it. It's funny how some soaps are overscented with an artificial smelling fragrance and others have a very natural fragrance that I just can't get enough of. This soap it's definitely the later. This is the perfect soap for someone like me, who isn't a morning person, to have in the shower. It makes me feel good and puts a smile on my face - even early in the morning. It makes me want to linger in the shower just to experience that fragrance. It's a good thing that it's shea butter enriched. It keeps my skin from feeling dry, even it a hot shower.

This soap lathers really well and seems to be fairly hard milled since it isn't shrinking too fast, even with repeated use."
Kids love them
"I like the idea of this software, a simplified photo ""express"" program that allows one to quickly and easily edit photos.

Unfortunately, the execution of Corel PaintShop Photo Express 2010 misses the mark.  The software is slow to install and seemed to bog down the computer system as soon as it was running.  The program also made itself ""king"" of all photo tasks on my computer, which I did not appreciate.

Like others have mentioned, the program overwrites your files without asking and without warning.  Not a big deal if you don't mind, but as is obvious from the other reviews, most people mind.

I have several different photo editing programs on my computer, based on how much editing I want to do and how long I want to spend.  These programs range from the free ones downloaded from the camera manufacturer's websites to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Photoshop-Elements-8/dp/B002ID8R3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Photoshop Elements 8</a>, but I do not plan to keep PaintShop Photo Express as one of them."
"When it does come down to PC sercurity software, there are very few software programs that really run smooth and straight forward with all PC's. That was what I found surprising with Bitdefender's PC Security Siftware It is simple and easy to comprehend if you own Windows 7 Software, as well as a Apple PC. However, if you own a older PC version of Windows like Windows XP, you unfortunately will find that the software will not run as smoothly. It actually handles well with Windows Vista though. The security and protection is very strong, and gives a detailed and strong screening of anti-virus and spyware, but also handles well with online protection with your computer, without many flaws while you surf the web. I really recommend Bitdefender's programs as a great buy for your PC protection.

"A product like this is crying to be compared to the free products out there.  What can it do that something like Paint. NET for example not do.  The truth is that if you don't intend on doing more than cropping pictures to put on your blog and maybe remove some red eye from your pictures from the birthday party then you probably don't need this.  But if you intend on doing more, cleaning up photos beyond the basics then Paint Shop Pro is the right product.  It isn't too expensive and although it has quite a learning curve once you get the hang of using it, it actually is very simple.  The selection tools are great and very accurate which makes adjusting or applying filters to parts of your picture a breeze.  And there are a bunch of filters that can make your pictures look much better.  Even if you aren't the best photographer in the world you can clean up your photos and make them look like they were taken by a professional, to some extent anyway.  I recommend this product.  It is well worth the price."

"THE QUICK TAKE:  Acronis True Image is very useful as part of a backup plan, as well as for tasks such as replacing a hard drive.  Stick to the core features and it will serve you well.

A PROVEN TOOL:  I've used Acronis True Image (ATI) for years, and is has saved me time and saved some important files.  For me, ATI is very useful to do two important jobs:

(1) Maintaining a current and complete backup of Windows, all installed programs and their settings, and user files, and
(2) Cloning a disk partition image to upgrade or replace a hard drive.

ATI CAN BACK UP A RUNNING WINDOWS SYSTEM:  Perhaps those who (like me) have been forced to learn far more about Windows than they ever wanted to, will be able to appreciate something I consider to be a minor miracle:  ATI can back up a running Windows system!  Windows is absurdly complex, and trying to back it up while it's running is a challenge.  But in the real world, that's an important capability to back up programs or user file directories on a regular schedule, to be prepared for a failure or other disaster.

USE ATI TO RUN SCHEDULED BACKUPS:  I always put my system and programs files on a separate hard disk partition from my user files.  I have ATI set to back up the user files often; and the system and program partition from time to time, as that doesn't change as quickly and I can always recover them the hard way if needed.

The value of backing up your user files should be clear.  What may be less clear is that if you ever need to recover a system installation, it's an incredible time saver to have the disk image of the systems and programs.  Installing Windows from scratch, then all the updates, then all your programs and settings is a huge time sink.  But if you have a recent disk image of your Windows and program files partition, you can very quickly be up and running and back doing your real work.

REPLACE YOUR HARD DRIVES AFTER 2-3 YEARS, BEFORE THEY FAIL:  Hard drives are cheap, and they keep getting cheaper, fast.  Given that, one of the best strategies for protecting your data and your time is to just replace your hard drives every 2-3 years of steady use, before they fail.  ATI makes that easy.  And as a bonus, you'll get a bigger, faster hard drive, given technology trends.  Trying to recover a failed hard drive, on the other hand, can be difficult or impossible.

STICK TO THE CORE FEATURES:  I agree with those who wonder about some of the features added to ATI.  Things like Try & Decide are just asking for trouble, to me.

NO RESTORE TO DISSIMILAR HARDWARE?  It seems odd to me that the feature to restore to dissimilar hardware isn't included in the basic version.  When hardware fails, I sometimes decide to replace a computer.  The ability to restore to dissimilar hardware should be included in all versions of ATI.

BACKGROUND PROGRAMS:  My other, more minor, complaint about ATI is that I wish it were customizable to allow you to control the background processes it installs and runs all the time.  It's not a big deal, especially given the amount of memory installed in today's computers, and the way virtual memory is managed.  And it is necessary to have some of those run from boot time - you can't start them later.  But if I'm never going to use a feature, I don't see why it has to run 24x7 on my computer.  I can reboot if I need to start it.

One other note - you can add the software to burn a bootable DVD or CD to your backups, to make it easier to restore the hard drive in an emergency or to guard against losing your ATI disc.  But you have to do that from within Windows.  You apparently can't do it by booting up the ATI disc instead of Windows."
"For the price, this is an awesome sketching tool. You definitely need a tablet to use this. If you have a tablet, buying this software is a no-brainer.

Start the thing up, and you are sketching immediately. The unique user interface tools take a short time to get used to, but they are well thought-out. There are tons of configurable drawing tools to keep things interesting.

If you do any kind of drawing or sketching and want to try out computer art - this is a great first buy. The tools may also be well suited for professionals. I am not a pro, but some of the sample artwork I've seen with this software is really good."
"I've used this for over a decade and haven't been audited. (fingers crossed). Includes Sched. C and depreciation schedules, although they keep nagging you to upgrade to the Home and Business product, for more money, of course.  Intuit also offers optional low cost audit insurance in case things go bad with the IRS."
"well, I bought it for this year taxes. I have been using Turbo Tax in previous yrs. when I tried to import previous years tax info, it started asking me about which files and such. How do I know which files? So, I stopped using it."
Shoe was somewhat large
"Look, I'm supposed to review this stuff, despite the fact that I'm a relative goof when it comes to more complex software, but when I selected this, it was described as being not very complicated for new users. I'm sure that many of you who are looking to order this are in the market for something that does a little bit of everything when it comes to photo editing software.

Right now, this is just taking up space on my hard drive because it's just too complex for me and I don't have the time or energy to learn how to use it. I've just been using the more basic photo editing freeware from around the internet which have much more of a ""point, drag, and click"" sensiblility about them.

Basically I know that I'm not the ideal person they could have chosen to give this to, and I'm sure that for the more experienced users, this might be something ideal, but for me and other n00bs, PaintShop Pro X4 Ultimate will pwn you."
Just read about how Win 10 tracks you.
"Family Tree Maker is the premiere geneology software available for consumers, and has tremendous capabilities for discovery, tracking, and creating documentation to share. It is also very time-demanding to use, both from a learning curve aspect and from a product usage aspect. It can also be expensive in the long-run if you maintain a subscription to Ancestry.com. I have casually used other geneology software years ago, and this package beats previous generations hands down in it's professional interface and plethora of features. Cooperative efforts over the internet through TreeSync with other family members can be a force multiplier. One newer feature, the photo editor, is a waste for me, since I have several other more capable software packages, but for some it may be helpful. If you have a great deal of time available to explore the software and web site, Family Tree Maker Platinum could be a powerful discovery and documentation tool. Frankly, I'm not as committed to tracking my geneology as this software requires."
"This product was a cinch to install.  So far I've had no problems.
I can't say how effective the product has proven in my system but I have had it for about a month now."
"Was having problems with another internet security software -- which ""missed"" protecting me a couple of ttimes.  Instlled, swept system and great protection.  Has some new features which I find appealing.  Will renew at end of year."
"I started using this software immediately after ordering it and got into the habit of using it so quickly, I forgot it was a Vine item.  I would have paid for this software.

It's a package deal for editing and organizing still photos and videos.  I confess I haven't played with the video editing much, but the photo editing is spectacular in regard to the appearance of the user interface, flexibility of viewing, ease of use, and so many editing features!

I'm also playing with layers for fractal art I've created.  There is so much one can do with this software.  I've had it over a year and still haven't tried everything.  I love it, and you will too."
"This  review also appears under the 3-license package listing.

I upgraded from the 2014 version to the 2015 release, trusting comments by Acronis representatives on this site that a longstanding problem, known as the ""Operations in Progress bug,"" had finally been resolved. As a retired IT manager, I realize that fixes require time, and I am more patient than most.

The ""Operations in Progress"" behavior prevents Windows users from properly shutting down their machines. While the Acronis site states that this is short-term, necessary behavior for its application to complete processing, in fact, it will lock the shutdown process indefinitely. For a full description of the problem, and the simple kinds of coding changes Acronis could have made to fix it, go to my review of the 2014 product at http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1TT0JA4FRFOLM/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EFRMBA6#R1TT0JA4FRFOLM.

The software behaved differently for a few months following the 2015 release's installation in November 2014, in that the ""Operations in Progress"" message usually timed out. But then, it abruptly changed back to the behavior so disliked in the 2014 release, always stopping the shutdown indefinitely. This tells me that not only has the problem not been fixed, but it certainly appears that Acronis altered the software without public notice a few months into this release. Any company that treats its customers with due respect will (a) listen to widespread concerns, and fix them; and (b) not apply updates without the customer's knowledge. However, Acronis projects an impression of corporate stubbornness and arrogance.

For a company that announced a billion-dollar (with a ""b"") revenue goal in March 2014, there is no excuse. Staffing should not be an issue. And the fixes should take only a few man-hours of coding time (if that), provided the software was written intelligently in the first place. I suspect the staff who reported to me could complete them in less than an hour.

The ""Operations in Progress"" problem continues to mess up Windows updates, many of which depend upon an orderly shutdown process that is not blocked by a third-party application like Acronis.

I am researching reviews for other backup options. I am impatient to move away from Acronis's products and its disrespect of customers."
"I have used this for sometime and find it to be very reliable, nothing speacial but it gets the job done well. It will protect from viruses and spyware -its simple and effective."
Love how it makes my hair feel thicker yet very manageable
"First of all, it is 3 ""installations"" only, not 3 PCs. Don't be fooled by the marketing tricks.

As like other virus tools, you need to uninstall old virus protection tool from your computer before installing the Norton 360 V5. Installation is exceptionally fast and within a minute or two, Norton 360 V5 is up and running.

The scans are done in the background. And it DOESN'T slow my PC while the scan is running. Computer feels the same way as it were stock. Also, it scans fast, much faster than my previous McAfee.

No major annoying popups. Only one I've encountered are ""High Resource Usage"", which I confirmed high system memory usage with window task manager.

Parental Controls are mediocre.

Norton's link scanner is a special feature. It not only tests links before you go there, but it also is capable of scanning your social media (like FaceBook) wall for links posted there, to ensure that the links lead to safe places. This is a big plus for people who are active on that social media sites. A useful feature !!

This version comes with a startup manager to help you to disable startup programs that you don't use or that you don't want to start up.

You cannot choose a disk you want to scan in a VirusScan GUI. If you want to scan just a particular volume, a folder or even a file, you can right-click on it in window explorer and choose the Scan option from the Norton sub-menu.

If there is any particular weakness in Norton360, it's the ""Backup"" feature which is very basic. And the 2GB free backup space is nearly useless. This is not a replacement for more capable backup utilities like Acronis TrueImage, or the Norton Ghost.

In summary, a faster and less resource-demanding virus protection tool with real useful add-on features. I highly recommend it."

"Most laptops/notebooks seem to ship with Windows 7 Home Premium rather than Windows 7 Professional.  That is probably fine for most users.  However, if you need your Windows 7 Notebook to be part of a business domain network, you need Windows 7 Professional.  This upgrade is how you accomplish the change.

It turns out that Windows 7 Home Premium already contains Windows 7 Professional; it is simply not enabled.  When you buy this upgrade you are getting an upgrade key.  No disk, just a key sticker and very brief instructions.  Key it in pursuant to the laughably simple instructions and within minutes you will be running Windows 7 Professional.  One caveat: apparently you cannot upgrade from Windows 7 32 to Windows 7 64 bit.  This will affect very few users as I do not believe that hardly any computers are shipping with 32 bit Windows 7.  Nor should they.  Windows 7 64 bit is very compatible with existing 32 bit software, and in the future we can expect lots of 64 bit software and we all want to be ready for it.

Some have criticized Microsoft for charging for the upgrade from Home Premium to Professional, but my opinion (which is only that) is that Microsoft makes its living by selling operating system software and this is one way for them to do it.  At least the upgrade is easy, painless, and quick.  RJB."
"I've used Quicken since the late 80s. I've tried MS Money, as well as other small accounting programs, but I always come back to Quicken. Though there are small things I do not like about Quicken (all the commercial stuff that gets offered) over all, I really think it is the best personal accounting system on the market.
It is extremely easy to use. It looks just like a check book register, so there's nothing to using it to keep track of basic spending.
It's also easy to set up categories and sub categories (like UTILITIES:SoCalGAS, UTILITIES:DWP) for your transactions so you can put everything into spending groups, for taxes or specialized reports, or just to be able to print out the payments to a particular payee or category like ""INSURANCE:Health"".
Once you put in your credit card accounts, Quicken will be able to download every transaction for you, and put it right where it belongs.
Those are just some of the very basic things Quicken can do. At years end, you can see exactly what you spent and where.
But the things I love the best... you can attach PDF notes or scanned documents to each transaction. I download most of my bills now a days, utilities and credit card statements, and I when I make a payment, I click the attachment like and attach my statement and the online receipt I got when I authorized a payment. On CDs or other bank accounts, I click the interest transaction and attach the statements that to with that account. I attach all my utility bills to the payment transactions and receipts for items with warranties, so I always have them with the click of a button. I can run reports and print them in PDF format, so I can email a payee with all the information about monies I've paid to clear up any disputes Or I can export all transaction to a payee to excel. The new interface is more customizable than previous version, making it easier to set up the way you like to work.
You can pay bills in Quicken, or do anything any of the others do, but I think Quicken is easier to learn and more reliable.
I know that other accounting programs offer many of the same features, but over the years I've NEVER lost a file in Quicken. I've never had a problem upgrading a file or running reports on files that go back as far as 1988."
"4 stars for what it is

If you are considering buying this, then you presumably already know that this is no Newsweek or Time magazine.

If you are considering buying this, then chances are you are looking for a light read filled with items from popular culture.  And that it is.  The glossy pages are filled with pictures of beautiful people: actors, singers, models, and reality stars.  Along with all of the sordid (but secretly entertaining) details of their lives.  If that's what you're looking for, you have found it.

I secretly enjoy the Who Wore It Best and Loose Talk (What the Stars Said this Week) features.  This is a fun magazine to read when you are looking to relax and pass a few hours, like at the beach or on an airplane.  Just don't expect to learn any real newsworthy news.

To be honest, I don't typically read this magazine because I personally find People magazine to contain better writing, a better assortment of stories, and better coverage of current events.  But we subscribe to both because my husband prefers this one for having more pictures and lighter reads.

So, if you are considering buying this, my best advice is to consider People instead."
"The price of the family pack makes this a no brainer.  You get license to install on 5 computers in the same household for a price less than two individual copies of Snow Leopard.  And the OS itself is fantastic, below is my review of the OS itself:

I installed the family edition tonight on two laptops, a MacBook and MacBook Pro. It is immediately obvious the new Finder is worth the price of admission alone. Finder windows open and close quickly, there's no annoying pauses and hangs. File copies are dramatically faster; no more need for power users to use a third party tool or drop into Terminal to copy files quickly. Time Machine backups are indeed faster, my old applications still work fine. When I opened a PowerPC app that needed Rosetta, Snow Leopard went to the Internet to download Rosetta--no need to dig out a DVD.

My primary applications--Photoshop CS3, Dreamweaver CS3, OmniGraffle Pro, PowerPoint 2008, Word 2008, Flex Builder, Eclipse, FireFox, VMware Fusion--all seem to work just fine.

So I see no reason not to upgrade: The speed improvements, the painless installation, and most significantly, the much-improved Finder make this a bargain of an upgrade.

And that's ignoring all the cool technologies under the hood (discussed in other reviews) and the small details that have been added (signal strength icons of wireless networks in the AirPort menu, for example)."
A really nice gift box. Recommend !
"I used this program last year. No need to pay an accountant $350 to complete a short 1041 Trust return. It did help that I had the previous year's return, which was done by the accountant. Be aware that this is actually TWO pieces of totally separate software. They don't even look the same. You'll have two new icons on your desktop. The Business piece doesn't seem as user-friendly as Premium."
I really liked this software and it was very simple and easy to use. IT synced well with the Ancestry.com website so I was very happy about that.
love gift cards
"While billed as working with Windows 8, it doesn't work on a Windows 8 tablet. You can't scroll the lists in the ""Your Library"" area, making most of your music inaccessible.

Customer service told me that it's not compatible with Windows tablets.

Perhaps this bug will be fixed in a future version."
"I have been using Yahoo map and Google map for long time. I also own a very good GPS (Garmin Nuvi 350). There is no much incentive for me to buy MS Stree & Trips. I bumped into a promotion deal to get the MS Street & Trips (the version without GPS) at a very low price. After playing with the MS Street & Trips for a month, I feel this tool is very useful. It's for sure better and faster than Yahoo map and Google map in all aspects. Once you use it, you will not going back to Yahoo map or Google map. It offer couple of print-out options that are handy and useful. I like its rich point-of-interest database. On the road, I rely on my Garmin Nuvi 350 GPS, but when I am in front of my computer, I sure can count on this Street & Trip software.

By the way, do not click ""cancel"" during installation. It's a lot of hassles to reinstall it if you ever hit ""cancel"" during the installation. I have to send email to Microsoft and talk to their life support to install this tool. But if you just let the installation process runs all the way through by itself, it's very easy to install. I will still gives this tool 5*."
"I don't know what all the disappointment is all about.  TurboTax pulled info from last year, I put the numbers in and it crunched them, everything all nice and pretty on the correct forms, done.

So the people with rental property, some kind of hobby or small business that makes you money, or you are a day trader or play with stocks, this is not for you as you need the next TurboTax up.

This one is for the blue collar guy that works for a living, the person that owns a home and has a 401k or IRA, donates time and/or money to charities among other things.

I did use Block's program one year and it wasn't quite user friendly, yes it cost less but it did not have a good user interface for me.

I do think that if TurboTax is going to make multiple programs then they should price it accordingly, make this one $30.00 and the premier could be $50.00 as to be somewhat competitive with other tax programs, if not, TurboTax may price themselves out of the tax business."
"Microsoft provides users with the fastest, sleekest consumer map software with Streets and Trips. As such, I have been a fan of Streets and Trips since the 2002 version. Unfortunately, Streets and Trips is merely a slight improvement over its predecessor, Streets and Trips 2006, and still has most of the key problems.

There is no question there are several benefits to Streets and Trips over online ""free"" applications with their invasive advertising, sluggishness and reliance on an Internet connection. Resident map data addresses all of these annoyances and gives the user more control. Putting that particular debate aside, Streets and Trips 2007 does suffer from a lack of connectivity in its inability to update core grid data and point-of-interest data over the Internet.

As I mentioned in my review of S&T 2006, Google Earth is setting the stage in the consumer map world. While Satellite photos do little for trip planning, Google does a nice job of locally caching large amounts of data from a remote server. The Streets and Trips development team must do the inverse of this. Most of the data should be resident on the local computer with dynamic integration from a variety of remote sources.

Dynamic updates can serve many purposes. The most straightforward is correcting inaccurate road information and updating core data as new roads are constructed. Secondly, there is a great deal of POI (point of interest) data that could be updated continuously. Lastly, if Microsoft promoted a comprehensive ecosystem, various government and private entities could provide plug-ins for Streets and Trips. At the current time, this ecosystem does not exist.

The lack of real-time connectivity leads to other shortcomings. In essence, Streets and Trips creates static maps. This precludes the implementation of real-time traffic or weather. Sadly, Microsoft has lost out on so many other value-added features that are provided by Google Earth, Yahoo Maps, and the Weather Channel online.

Oddly, key problems in its management of basic street data persist. For example, it can't properly interpret hyphenated street addresses in the boroughs of New York. Of course, it is impossible for a single user to error check the entire database, so I am curious what other errors exist.

Like most map programs, Streets and Trips is automobile-centric. This means that it interprets one-way streets literally. While great for drivers, it doesn't help for walking. Moreover, there is no interpretation of public transit systems where users would walk to a subway or train stop, board, and walk to a destination.

Shortcomings aside, Streets and Trips 2007 is still a very useful consumer mapping tool. After you become accustom to the application, you will find yourself using it for the most mundane trips. It is very fast and easy to use - perfect last-minute errand planning. In the larger context, however, Microsoft does need to update its Streets and Trips business model to provide users with the same features they have grown accustom to with web-based applications. Only then with Microsoft have a killer app.

Pros

Fast

Ease of use

Exceptional clarity in maps and interface

No advertisements

First connectivity steps with Windows Live

Cons

Can't properly interpret hyphenated addresses

No export of point-of-interest data

No integration with 3rd party data

No real-time traffic

Won't print to larger formats (can't print to legal or tabloid)

Not enough control during printing (fonts and streets)

Not fully integrated with Office applications"
"I am in the research sector, and we use Excel quite often for large volumes of data, so when this came out I was quite excited that I would finally be able to use my mac for doing some of my work...especially since there are extra cells in this version! Not the case. My files take forever to open (both large and small files). Typically the files take a good bit longer to open than the previous version (if they open at all that is)! It also gets hung-up when copying and pasting and I have had many occurrences of corruption of files. Sometimes I have no recourse but to do Ctrl-Alt-Del to restart the computer because it completely freezes. Do NOT buy this!"
happy with magazine
"product key was fine, but this was a relatively old cd, and I had to download Kaspersky from their web site to install  on a windows 8.1 computer.  But after doing that the code activated it fine"
This won't be a very technical review because there are many here that have gone into great details about the technical specifications. My purpose for choosing this software was to be able to watch my DVDs when traveling in a much better program then what's installed on my laptop. I love the user interface because it's very user friendly. I didn't have any issues with installation. I haven't gone through every single feature but the software works perfectly for what I'm using it for.
"After spending countless hours trying to get Turbo Tax, which I'd used for about 10 years, to fill in and calculate my taxes correctly, I gave up and bought H&R Block At Home Deluxe + State 3 years ago instead. I've been happy with the software every year since then. The first year I did the online download through Amazon and it went quickly. Installation was straightforward as it is with the actual disc. In fact, the whole process went quickly and it filled in and calculated our taxes. It was able to handle the HSA account info I had for two of the year's accurately and without a glitch. This was what had caused the problem with Turbo. It also took me through itemized deductions, interest and dividends easily.

The interface isn't as graphically appealing as Turbo Tax, but it's easy to use and did my taxes accurately. I was able to download the state version for free and it took less than 5 minutes for it to install, get my info from the federal taxes and fill it out. Both state and federal seemed to go faster with H&R and it was very straightforward. I'll be using H&R Block from now on. H&R has a feature that can get your info from last year's Turbo Tax if you decide to switch over."
"Let me start off by saying this is a wonderful software package. The accounting and inventory portion of this software is premium by far.

But that is where the high praise ends for me. This is a subscription based software. This isn't like owning a copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CorelDRAW-Graphics-Suite-X6/dp/B007IWCQ8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X6</a>, or a copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Office-Professional-2010/dp/B0036Z0NW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Office Professional 2010</a>&nbsp;and it's yours. You have to shell out money every year to use this software.

Plus, it's not like the previous versions of Peachtree where payroll and taxes were inclusive to the software. These are now seperate purchases and are quite costly and are annual subscription based softwares as well.

There are several different fees that are required to use the full potential of the software, which they market to you pretty consistenly.

So if you put alot of work and investment into your accounting and inventory, using this software, they kind of have you and your business hostage.

The big disappoint is that this information isn't disclosed here on Amazon. However, it is disclosed on the box.

Here is the information verbatim on the box:

""Important Note:
When upgrading to Sage 50 Accounting 2013 from Sage Peachtree 2012 and earlier versions, you will no longer be able to manually manipulate the tax tables within Sage 50. You will now be required to have a Sage 50 Payroll Solution or Sage Business Care Gold or Platinum subscription, in order for your Sage 50 solution to calculate taxes, benefits and liabilities on payroll checks. In addition, a subscription will be required to access payroll tax forms and to use the Exception, Payroll Tax, Tax Liability, Vacation and Sick reports or any custom reports based on these reports. Without a subscription, you will only be able to manually enter the tax, benefits, and liability figures on payroll checks and run payroll reports not previously listed.""

This information and the new working matrix of Sage 50 should be disclosed on here so that those who are wanting to purchase this software, they have full disclosure of the software and what is required to use the software.

If you are a small business or very small business, this is probably an investment that you more than likely should avoid, unless you can really work it into your budget. However, if you do not need the the above, then it is indeed a wonderful and premium accounting and inventory software."
"Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite 10 is packed full of features that you will come to love, but has one huge drawback -- the installation process is horrid to say the least.  I'd have no problems at all rating this a 4 or 5 star product if not for the installation woes.  However, once you get past that the program really excels in providing a full suite of digital media tools that are sure to please any Windows user.

One of the drawbacks to digital media, especially on the Windows platform, has always been how many programs you have to use to get something simple done -- such as create a movie and burn it to DVD.  With so many households using digital cameras and camcorders nowadays, the Windows platform has really lagged behind in having a tool set to help these digital households create, manage and share their media.  With Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite 10 you get a full arsenal of programs to help you make this task a little easier.

Home users want software that is simple and gets the job done.  I'm happy to say that Roxio fits this bill.  I've used a variety of programs over the years to manage and share my footage from my camcorder.  They all have worked reasonably well, but they never provided a complete package to work with.  In Roxio, I found a lot of tasks that were tedious to do with other programs -- such as adding overlay tracks with text or audio -- was a snap to do.  The first video I produced with Roxio, my review of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logitech-Cordless-Desktop-Wave-Set/dp/B000TKHGL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logitech Cordless Desktop Wave Set</a>, took less than 10 minutes to produce.

However, this program suite is more than just a digital movie maker.  You will also find a wide array of tools to help manage your digital audio, create data CD's and DVD's (including burning ISO images) and programs to help you even manage content from your mobile devices!  For the price you pay you really are getting quite a bit of software to help you manage your digital tasks.

Another plus to this suite of programs is that it can grow to meet your needs.  You can start out simple, such as getting your video off your camcorder and making a simple movie with the CineMagic program.  As you get more familiar with video editing the program lets you control almost every aspect of it by giving you the controls to edit track-by-track, clip-by-clip and scene-by-scene.  Advanced users will like the ability to have total control over their media, while newcomers will enjoy the wizards and walkthroughs provided by the product.

Overall, Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite 10 is a great family of products that will help you take control over digital life.  The only thing to watch out for, and why I gave it three stars, is the installation process can be extremely problematic -- especially under Windows Vista.  Be prepared for extremely long wait times without any feedback as to what is going on.  Hopefully, Roxio will address these concerns and fix this problem to make this product worthy of 4+ stars."
Works well for PC's that are not equipped with Bluetooth. Plug & Play on Windows products.
BEWARE.  This product is VERY buggy.  In addition the upgrades are impossible.  I purchased two months ago - and just this week did a software update.  The update to download is  185 MBs - the entire program - and required three Reboots for its normal install.  A full 90 minutes was required to upgrade with DSL (15 minutes to download - and 75 minutes for the incredibly slow installation and reboots).  Now - if I want to use it for HD video - I have to purchase an Add-on and reinstall again.  No way.  In my 10 years of using computers with dozens of programs - this is the worst upgrade process I have seen.
Love this product. Cleans hair quickly and leaves hair soft.
"First off, I had problems importing info.  Lost some dates and relatives.  Good news is that it integrates well with ancestory.com and includes 6 months sub.  The bad news is ancestory.com is expensive to use afterwards.  I've basically just use the ancestory.com app with the ipad now."
frsd
not good security
A gift that was appreciated by the receiver.
"Unlike other Turbo Tax years, the 2008 version was relatively big, and came with the added benefit of free electronic filing --- although that feature may have been added only after regular subscribers complained that the online subscribers were getting added perks not available to Turbo Tax ""veterans."" The main problem with this software is that even when one ""subscribes"" --- presumably to avoid shipping expenses --- the price keeps going up. Every year, it gets more and more expensive. Still, overall Turbo Tax beats having to hire an accountant. And it's fairly simple to use and fairly complete."
"This product is a no-brainer. I have used Norton consistently for the last 10 years and it's the only product (I've used MacAfee, Kapersky and others), that has kept my PCs--and now phone and tablets--free from viruses. The best!"
"The presenter here sounds much more natural than the semi-robotic delivery found in the DreamWeaver tutorial product.

The lessons are broken up into easily digested 3-5 minute chunks, covering aspects of Flash from project planning and defining customer needs to an introduction to ActionScript fundamentails. Although it does not deal with programming in detail, it does cover basic concepts of object-oriented programming, variables, conditional statements, and functions. The rest covers working with artwork and text; library and symbols; layers, timeline, animation, and tweens; working with files, sound and video. You'll learn the fundamentals; you won't learn how to create those fancy user interfaces on those fancy sites; that's for a more advanced class.

As with other products in this series, there are some usability issues. At the top of the interface, there's a ""Previous Video"" button and ""Next Video"" button. The ""Next Video"" button is disabled for the last video of each chapter, so to get to the next one you'll have to use other navigation. This is because the last item is the test. Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read ""Take Test"" instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists/links to the other videos in the chapter. The title bar (under the top-left tabs) is a dropdown to navigate the content.

There's a ""Watch and Work"" mode which shrinks the video display to let you work with your copy of DreamWeaver (not included). You can move the video window around BUT you CANNOT resize it - and it may be kind of tiny to watch in that mode. So if you have a dual monitor setup, you'll want to drag the Standard Mode video player to the other screen; Standard Mode cannot be resized to be smaller, either.

All in all it's a good way to get started in Flash programming, if you don't have the patience for going through a book. Know what to expect; you'll learn the basics, but you'll need to carry on the learning process yourself, by seeking out more advanced information or learning materials."
"If you can only subscribe to one news weekly, I would suggest The Economist.  I've been reading it for almost thirty years and am never disappointed.  Combining incisive reporting with humor and a bit of serendipity, The Economist is a must-read in today's global world."
Not like old RD- now has lots of lightweight original content. Sort of a disappointment- but it's my link to what got me started reading when I was little.
Waist of time!
"I been using Nortons software for more than 15years on all my laptops and desktops and never suffered debilitating computer virus. The program warns users when specific threats are detected needing a special scan. Also, regular updates are automatically transmitted to users."
"I've recently been tinkering in Adobe Premiere Pro CC, Cyberlink PowerDirector 12 Ultimate and Pinnacle Studio 17 Plus along with having used Nero and Roxio video editing products in the past.

Obviously the absolute best program of the bunch is Adobe Premiere Pro - at a premium price.  Within the reasonable and affordable price point for PURCHASED software (instead of a monthly license structure that Adobe CC has transitioned into) the PowerDirector 12 Ultimate is superior since I was not overly impressed with Pinnacle Studio 17 Plus.  Both PowerDirector and Pinnacle Studio 17 are far far superior to Nero and Roxio video editing products."
"I've taken some videos with my camera and my phone and sometimes they have size limitations on how long you can record before you have to start a new recording.  I have a not so smart smart phone :(

I have some videos that I wanted to try and put together to make it one video instead of several shorter clips so I decided to try out this Corel Video Studio.  I'm sure this is much more robust than I actually need, but it got good reviews so I thought why not?

It was relatively non-stressful to install.  I hate installing new programs because it never goes as smoothly or as quickly as I think it should.  After installation I started it up and quickly realized that there was going to be a learning curve involved.  I've learned the basics, and I have no doubt that there is much more that I haven't learned to do, but in the end it did what I wanted it to do without throwing my hands up in frustration :)

I'm sure there are other more technical reviews, but from the perspective of a novice I think you will be pleasantly surprised at how quickly and easily you can add ""director"" to your list of attributes."
I have used Turbo Tax for the last five years and I have had no problems. The Amazon gift card for up to 10% of your return is a great deal.
I was given a subscription to this magazine during my pregnancy and have gaining a lot of knowledge on the baby world from it.  I enjoy the read and have picked up a lot of great ideas from it.
"I was very excited to sink my teeth into CorelDraw and I got to experience it, but not on my primary computer.  First, let me just warn the beginners:  It is a very extensive software package and the learning curve is difficult.  It does include a book as you might expect.  If you can get past all of that, this can be one of the most rewarding software packages that you've ever installed.

I would like to use this review to share a possible problem that seem to trouble some users:  As I tried to install it on my laptop, it kept on telling me that ""Another installation is already in progress,"" but there was not another installation anywhere!  I take pride in my laptop as it is fast and clean.  Every other program that I tried installing not named ""Corel"" installed flawlessly.  However, Corel gave me problems.  I visited their message boards and found out I wasn't the only one.  I contacted their email support and within a day, I received a response that I must transfer the disc contents onto my drive first.  That sounds nice, but the fact that this day and age you have to work-around a problem like that is unacceptable, especially if you are a mogul like Corel.  I hope this work-around does help anyone who experiences this very annoying problem."
what can you say --- it's Subway and gets to fast when you order it.
Google the uses and you will be a buyer.
This McAfee antivirus software works exactly as advertised. It was easy for me to download and get set up (took around 20 minutes). I like that I can use it on multiple devices if I need to and the price is right. No complaints!
Good for cloning only. Image backup need improvement. Macrium Reflect faster and better
"There is little to like and a lot to dislike about this program.  It insists on making you operate its way, and tries to force you to schedule everything, schedule, schedule, schedule. ""Do it our way, and do it when we damned well tell you to do it.""

For example, when you just want to do a quick backup, it has all sorts of calender nonsense, even though it's just a backup.  It won't use your name for the backup, so you end up with backup1, backup2, backup3, etc., with no easy clue as to when it was made and what is in the backup.  It does not have conventional menus to get you where you need to go, you have to fumble around and try to find something that looks like it might be what you want.  But few of the usual options are available.  In other words, the programmers are so convinced that you are stupid and have no idea what you want, that they have made it essentially useless.

There there is the fact that it takes up a whopping 123 mb on your disk, and forces you to load a ""service"" that runs all the time, slowing down and clogging up your machine (and perhaps conflicting with a program you really need). Yet another program by programmers who apparently believe that your only purpose in having a computer is running their ""wonderful"" software.

My son has a previous version of this software that I've used on his machine, and although I didn't like it much, at least it was functional.  I can't say the same about 2009.

I've uninstalled it, I haven't decided whether to throw it away or donate  it.  It's certainly not something I'm willing to use."
"I installed the software on a Win 7 machine with 12 gig of RAM.  The software installed and run without problems.  The software was very easy to use without much of a learning curve.  I was somewhat worried because of my past experience with some of the companies other products but this one ran great.

Highly recommended."
I love the feel of my skin after using the Avon Skin So Soft Fusions Dual Softening Body Wash.  My skin was amazingly smooth!!
Worked.
"I've been using TaxCut (now H&R Block at Home) for well over 5 years, and all and all, it's OK.  One year I ran by taxes with BOTH H&R Block and Turbo Tax, and both came up with the same answer.  The issue is not with the program's math, but the way that it asks us to answer the questions, the amount of examples to help us decide what all to include in a number, or if a certain situation applies to us or not.  Again this year, 2009, I waited until the prices came down at least 10 bucks under their usual advertised price.  Generally, you should not file until after Feb 1st as the financial companies have through January to get their forms to you.  And, it's not unusual for the tax preparation companies to have online updates well into February, and if those tweaks applied to you, you'd want them before filing.

Each year, the Federal forms go pretty well, but the State of Wisconsin's forms are lacking in the H&R versions. On several occasions, H&R's program did not handle situations that applied to me, and they tell me, this form is not supported, and here's the link to get the paper form and then I have to file paper, not electronically.  This year, the WI AMT form was not supported.  Sad.  It's not that I really want to pay the AMT tax, but if I have to, at least make it easy for me to do that!  The WI AMT form is a hard one to understand, so this would have really been a good one for H&R Block to have automated.  Maybe next year.

So why do I keep using H&R Block?  They are always 5-10 bucks less, and from what I have seen or heard, the Turbo Tax version is not that much better when it comes to the State forms.  I do like the Deduction Pro add-on that H&R Block provides, so that's a plus."
Timely delivery of this magazine but weekly is really too much.  I was having trouble keeping up with reading them.  I did not renew just because it was too many to read.  Just not enough time.  My fault.
"Honestly, this doesn't do what I would want it to do.  The part that's good is the Children's filter, but I have a router which does the same thing, so the software was a bit duplicative.  Much of what's provided is also provided by the mail/IM software.

What I would like to see something like this do is search for spyware as well as manage/delete cookies!  Then it would be much more useful."
Enjoyable magazine.
"Amazon had the best price for this excellent software, without having to submit the coupon for the rebate.  I have used turbotax for years."
"It works great. I loaded all my transactions from Edward Jones, which saves me a lot of time. It's repetitively easy to use.  It also costs a whole lot less than paying a tax professional.  I also feel good about being able to do my taxes myself.  I've used TurboTax for maybe 15 years or so, and I have always been pleased."
"I have used Quicken for a decade and TurboTax for most of the past few years, but I am seriously considering switching to MS Money and TaxCut.  When trying to import my validated Quicken Premier H&B 2005 data into TurboTax Premier 2005 I invariably receive an error message and Quicken crashes.  Spending hours on the phone with TurboTax's pleasant but unknowledgable ""tech support"" has been an exercise in futility. There is clearly a problem with the TT software, but the nice young people on the other end of the phone keep trying unsuccessfully to search their ""knowledge base"" for solutions and refuse to let me speak to anyone more senior and experienced or even give me info on where I can forward the error message to a programmer to look into it. Useless software and lousy tech support is a bad combination."
"This was available at a significant discount so I bought it from Amazon.  I think that the free competitors are as useful and capable as this, but there were some freebies from other companies included in this package that made this worth the price.

I also discovered I was looking more for a program that was designed for art work more than this provides.

I did purchase a tablet and it makes this much more useful and user friendly."
"*** Update 9/30/2013 ***

I am reducing my rating from four stars to one. This is because this program not only does not work as well as the  2005 version but it also failed to migrate reports from the older version to the new version.

I have installed this version on a Windows XP and Windows 7 partition. In both systems for the program works the same: Even though I have set it up to memorized transactions, this version absolutely refuses to do so. After going through a lengthy troubleshooting with Quicken tech support we determined it was not a corrupted data file. They recommended I uninstall Quicken and download and run a program that will clean out all traces of the installation (supposedly).

After doing the above and reinstalling Quicken 2013 the same problem exists. It took me a while to notice this as many of my routine transactions were previously memorized and those memorized transactions still automatically popped up. As of this date there seems to be no solution. To put it bluntly this version is a dog.

*** Original Review ***
I've been a Quicken user since version 2 for DOS way back in 1988. While I don't use many of the advanced features, I do rely on it to keep my finances in order. Over the years Intuit has had a nasty habit of messing with an interface that worked pretty well. They also tweak the file format just enough so that the data from the new version is not backward compatible, so you can't go back, even if you don't like the new product. My latest version was Quicken 2005 and I was happy with it, but since it was offered this on Vine, I decided to give the latest version a try.

Before beginning the installation I did a backup of my Quicken 2005 data. After the backup was completed I begin the installation.

After accepting the license agreement informs me that it will uninstall my previous version and migrate my data the new one. After the installation is complete it wants me to reboot. This I do.

After rebooting I start Quicken 2013 and register the product. After completing the registration it converts my Quicken 2005 data to Quicken 2013 format, but only after backing up my Quicken 2005 data to a separate folder. Nice touch.

Quicken 2013 puts two icons on your desktop, one for the program and one inviting you to check your credit score. I think the second is really lame. Still, there's a lot less advertising than in previous versions of Quicken.

As with any Quicken installation it automatically installs sound files for many operations. I immediately went to the control panel and eliminated most of them. Besides these minor gripes the installation went smoothly.

Most, but not all, of your settings from the previous version are maintained, so you still have to go into the preferences to check.

Once the program opens the first thing you notice is the drab interface. Still gives you a choice of four color schemes but all are equally drab. The shading in the register is so light it's virtually indistinguishable from the white.

Tab Bar
Across the top of the register are several tabs. You can choose which tabs to show or hide, but the process is clunky, as you must go into the ""View"" menu for each item you want to change rather than just presenting you a list that you can choose from and letting you click all the ones you want. At least you can choose ""Classic Menus"" and uncheck ""Show Tabs."" There is also a tab bar at the bottom of the screen that you cannot make go away.

The new interface is generally nice and the program is stable for me both on XP and Windows 7.

Bottom Line
I find Quicken essential to managing my finances, but for my modest needs Quicken 2005 worked well. Had I not gotten the program through Vine I would not spent the money on this version. Now having evaluated the program I do not feel there is sufficient added value to justify upgrading. IMO, if you have a previous version of Quicken that works well for you I see no reason to upgrade to Quicken 2013, especially since there does not seem to be an upgrade price for users of previous versions. If you are just starting out with Quicken, I would suggest Quicken Basic or even Quicken Checkbook."
"I use TurboTax every year.  It has some small quirks and an annoying habit of trying to sell you upgrade through the process.  However, If you want to know your taxes are done correctly and you want to avoid paying an accountant to do the work, this gets the job done quickly.  Despite what Tim Geithner says, it is easy to use."
easy to use for older ages
So far I'm enjoying reading through this magazine and seeing the wonderful art that's out there.  Very inspiring.
great fathers day gift
"I've been using TurboTax for the past 10 years, and find that it's an excellent product. The software is extremely easy to use, and all that's required is for you to answer a series of simple questions for each category.

With that said, the customer support needs improvement. After e-filing my return, the IRS sent me a letter stating that they needed additional information on one of the forms that I had filled out. Being unable to get through to the IRS, I opted to speak with someone at TurboTax. While I was connected within 30 minutes, the person at the other end of the call was clueless about my situation. I was told that my call was being transferred to a tax expert, and that I'd only be on hold for a few minutes.

My few minutes of hold time ended up being well over 2 hours, at which time I gave up. Subsequently, I've still been unable to get through to anyone in the know at TurboTax, and when I call the number provided to me by the IRS, I'm met with a recording that states that they're unable to accept calls due to extremely high call volume. This is despite the tax filing season having ended.

The bottom line is that while this software is great, if you can't get through to a knowledgeable person in customer support, you're in trouble. Since your only other alternative is to call the IRS, and they're never able to accept calls, you're left in a no win situation."
"Are you the family historian, in charge of corralling ticket stubs, faded photographs, and the stories of previous generations? Or perhaps you've already dipped a toe into researching various branches of your family tree, but become overwhelmed with reining in all the bits of information you've been finding?

If so, you've probably been looking for a multimedia method of stitching together various components in a way that's easier to navigate and control than spreadsheets and folders and narratives, whether electronic, physical or some combination of both. Especially if you are dealing with a combination of file types, once you hit a certain point, the gathering process can feel more like working on your tax return rather than seeking and preserving meaningful connections and interesting stories. Although I enjoy research and don't mind wrestling data and images, I found building a family history less than pleasant before I began using this program.

Although Family Tree Maker is not especially intuitive, it does have a certain identifiable logic. It may help you to make notes of common steps and processes when you're getting started so you can boost your comfort level and spend more time on research and less on mechanical underpinnings.

If you're geographically removed from source materials and areas in which your ancestors lived, you may find that a lot of your research almost must take place online, and thus the tie-in with the Ancestry website is a plus for this program. Keep in mind that if you want to gather specific primary- and secondary-source material, you may still need to provide signed requests for such materials, but the provided 6-month subscription to the Ancestry site does give you a chance to gather as much data as possible, which you can add to in later stages of your work. This has been my method so far, since I'm not fond of subscription-driven software.

While my impression thus far is largely positive, I do think the process of backing up data should be more robust, as should the variety of choices of output. I also am disappointed that the newest version is only available for Windows platforms. Frankly, I wonder how much more peer-to-peer connectivity there might be internationally if this program continued to be as diverse as its users. These two factors, plus some intermittent software hiccups, have caused me to assign a midrange rating. Because of the multimodal nature of this product, I merely mention the complexity and required learning curve, but neither of these factors has impacted my rating."
"Cyberlink PhotDirector 6 Ultra was easy to install on my Windows 7 Premium 64 bit system. When I started the program, at first glance I thought I had accidentally opened my Adobe Lightroom. The similarities are undeniable. Although I have not had a great deal of time to play with the software, it seems to be fairly easy to use and is possibly more user friendly than Lightroom. Quite a few presets are included and more can be downloaded plus the user can create and save his own presets. The editing panel also includes numerous options. Overall, I believe Cyberlink PhotoDirector 6 is an excellent choice for those who do not want to pay for the premium Adobe software."
Best antivirus out there.  Luv that it does most of the scans and stuff for u.  Most people never remember to manually run them.
"I ordered WinZip 17 to compress files for storage, mainly video files. We also need it to unzip files that people send us via email. We also plan to use it to encrypt files.

WinZip 17 was simple to install. We immediately began using it without reading any instructions.

The file compression speed is fast although even with our year old computer it hogs the system while compressing, meaning, you can't do much else with the computer when it is compressing. However the compression speed is fast so we just don't multitask during that procedure.

I rate this software 5 stars = I Love It for its ease of use and fast compression speed."
"I got these for personal use.  Perfect price for a beginner set of brushes.  Plus, it came with red glitter!! I mostly use the smallest size of the swirled handle for clean up and one of the line brushes and the angled one.
I highly recommend these if you're using them for yourself.  I can't speak to how well they'd hold up for professional use."
"Try different security software since all manufacturers offer free trials (most 30 days, though Norton's is 15), and no security software works great on all computers.  You can then purchase the software you like elsewhere at a lower cost compared to the manufacturer and type in the security key.

I am giving stars based on how well it protects and what are the odds of the product working well.  On the plus side Norton is bullet proof, and I can attest to that since we use it at work (it also has advantages in a network environment).  Five star protection.

On the down side, I do not like Norton since while not bad anymore, it is not fast and efficient.  But my biggest problem is that I think it is locked down so tight that it too easily causes side affects.

I tried it at home and I could not get it to work at all, which is OK since like I said, no security software works perfectly on all computers.  However I could not remove it.  I tried standard uninstall, a utility program on the Norton site, and standard windows methods including registry deletions.  I finally booted up in command mode and deleted the program that way.  However I then lost network connections and tried for three hours before I gave up and did a total new install of Windows.  It must have thought I was a virus.  We have problems at work which we solve with new installs also.  Based on my expereince and all that I hear, I feel odds are good it will not work for you hence two stars.

Like I said, nothing works well on all computers I also evaluated Trend Micro and BitDefender on two of my home computers, a super fast computer and my kids old 1.4ghz clunker, both XP computers built by me.  BitDefender was outstanding on my kids virus/malware magnet, but somehow either it or I turned off protection on my computer (granted it warned me with two big red X's and I was too dense to look that up).  The 2007 version of Trend Micro does not work on my kid's computer.  I hated the McAfee 2007 interface so I never tried the 2008 version.

Bottom line - TrendMicro, BitDefender, Norton, Panda, and others offer great protection.  Pick one and see if it works great.  If you do not have Norton, try one of the others first since I think others have a better chance of working.  I decided on TrendMicro, bought the software from Amazon much cheaper then straight from TrendMicro, and will be inserting the security key into the evaluation copy."
"I have used AVG for years. The free version was good, but the full version is superb! I never have to worry about my computer with this product. The constant updates give it an edge other products of this type don't have, and it very user friendly. You can change things according to your needs.
Highly Recommended!

Diane Davis White"
"Installed. Program interface wouldn't come up. Got blank screen that said ""UI not found. Well this is embrassing."" Eventually figured out it needed 'Terminal Services' turned on in System Configuration Utility. Found out no thanks to Avast. It could have told me what it needed  but it didn't. And 'Terminal Services' is not something you really want to have running in the first place.

I only installed minimum configuration. AntiVirus core, Web browser protection & Email protection. It brought Firefox to its knees, slow and eventually locking up repeatedly. Uninstalled Web browser protection. Firefox still locking up.

Uninstalled entire Avast product using their tool. Which required running in Safe Mode. God only knows what it did while it had free reign there.

Then I discovered that Avast had destroyed all my restore points. It had gone mucking around in the restore point files to remove a trivial PUP. As if they wouldn't know that hacking up restore point files wouldn't destroy their usefulness. I wanted to go back to a restore point I made just before I installed Avast to make sure it was all gone. Forget that. And if I had had any other crisis, I'd been totally hosed.

Avast is a screw-up product. It LOOKS like it's slick and running well  but it ain't. Stay away from this product."
"This doesn't work well with Windows 10, But other then that it was ok."
"I am an IT consultant with over 25 years experience.  I recommend this to all my home and small-business clients.  Some ""computer experts"" will claim that it takes up a lot of resources, or that it is not as good as other anti-virus/security products.  Neither is true.  I benchmarked my own computer both before and after installing Norton Security Deluxe, and saw NO appreciable difference in performance.
As for the ""not as good as other products,"" I can't tell you how many times I have seen problems with other anti-virus applications, especially the free ones.  I have only seen one situation where Norton had a problem - for some reason, it locked down access to shared files from the local computers.  And that was an easy fix."
"A really good gentle cleanser. Always leaves my hair feeling clean, and soft. Also virtually eliminated dandruff issues where other bigger named products consistently failed."
"This product is quite easy to install and simple to use, but doesn't have much explanation about the laws of particular states and the different options available.  The forms are pretty basic.  They are good if you are leaving the bulk of your estate to one or two people and making a few specific bequests.  I wanted to use this to update a new will, since my old one is about ten years old, but ended up just typing the new one in because my old form is much better for where I live.  If, however, you don't want to hire a lawyer and you don't know how to pull together every form you might need for end of life legal dispositions (will, health care directive, etc.) and you don't have a big or complicated life, this will do the trick nicely and save you a lot of money.  If there is anything complicated in your dispositions or instructions, I would recommend paying for an attorney.  A few hundred dollars now can save your heirs thousands of dollars in expenses and hours of heartache."
"I have to hand it to Microsoft, they know how to market their software.  That's the only reason I can think of as to why anyone would be dumb enough to upgrade from Vista to Win 7...or from XP for that matter.  It's the same operating system!  I have both Vista and Win 7.  Win7 is on a newer system and Vista is on an older system.  Both run at the same speed...slow.  Both crash just as often.  Both are resource hogs.  This would have to mean that Win 7 actually runs slower if I'm getting the same performance from a newer computer.  Now, keep in mind, I'm not running cutting edge hardware, but I'm not using highly sophisticated software either.

I'm always amazed how Microsoft can maintain such a level of dominance in the OS market with this kind of sub par quality.  Mac has taken almost 10% market share from Microsoft.  Linux is slowly on the rise.  It runs at 5 times the speed using 1/3 of your resources.  I'd love to see a company with enough marketing power and sheer guts to take on Goliath."
"I was really looking forward to Vista.  I ran out and got my copy as soon as it hit shelves.  Two weeks later, I uninstalled it.  I don't know when, or even if, I will reinstall it.  Here's why:

1) Game support - BEFORE you buy Vista, make sure your favorite game has a Vista patch, because it most likely won't work otherwise.  Check online to ensure that they are compatible, because many just aren't.

2) Immature drivers - in point 3 below, you'll see that Vista flat out does not support many hardware devices.  Even for those that it does, the drivers are so new, that the device (like my GeForce 7900GT) actually run SLOWER in Vista than XP.

3) Hardware support - most vendors are NOT releasing Vista drivers, to force people to buy new hardware.  For instance, my scanner (Epson) has no vista compatible driver (I tried the XP driver), and neither does my camera.  BEFORE you buy Vista, check to see that your hardware is supported!

4) Copy protection.  Like to copy a DVD so you can watch it whenever you want?  Forget it!  It WILL NOT happen in Vista, M$ made sure of that.  Same thing with programs like TuneBite that let you convert WMA songs into MP3s.

5) Antivirus.  Vista's security it, well, more secure than XP.  But the antivirus applications compatible with it are VERY lacking at this point.  And there are already viruses (virii?) out for Vista, so you DO need it.

6) Firefox - many sites do not work under Firefox with Vista.  And some extensions do not work.  I can't help but think this might be intentional."
"Rated it low because it is a waste of money. Felt like reading a ""rag"" to relieve some boredom and ended up bored with the magazine. Writting skills are limited and articles are jammed into each pages. Found it hard to read on the Kindle"
Another great gift.
"I have been a serious amateur photographer for some time with more knowledge than talent.  I have used Photoshop a lot but never used a work flow package other than iPhoto, so despite understanding the concepts of workflow I have not had any practical experience using any tool like Lightroom.  So out of the box this was a little intimidating to use.

Setup/installation - This worked great other than having to update my Mac OS to 10.9 to get it to install.  Once the OS was up to date, the actual installation was very quick, just a few minutes.

Starting Use - Here things got a little hairier.  Much like Photoshop, there are lots of options, likely many that an individual will never use.  The tool icons are familiar, but took a while to get the gyst and some old digital images imported.  Immediately the things I like are the ability to change the white balance of batched photos.  I batched a series of images of Marmots and Ground Squirrels in Alaska and took them from worthless to perfect in no time (if you subtract the time it took me to figure out how to get them all batch selected and then converted.

HDR - I was also excited to see that HDR is built in.  I have long played with Photomatix's trial version but have been afraid to pull the trigger.  Also, I have used the Photoshop plug in and this built in option is more like the plug in and less dynamic than Photomatix.  Or at least with my current abilities.  I can get it to make decent HDR images again testing with Alaskan images of glaciers, but I cannot get that unworldly look.  Not sure if that is me, or not in the abilities of this software. But I was able to get highlights on the ice as well as details in underbrush so that is success.

Other things - It does look like there is a learning curve and I am still early in the process.  I have many photos from over the years and hope to shoot some to start populating catalogs and seeing how this affects my work flow.  I'm looking forward to trying more batch corrections and occasional clean up with the editing tools.  From my brief playing, stuff like red eyes and little flaws in image or exposure are fairly quick to fix.  I like the base tools on the right and it works as well if not faster than photoshop for me.  Looking forward to additional exploration including Meta data etc."
"I've used Turbo Tax Deluxe Federal and State for the past 2 years with no issues. However, this year the cost of e-filing went up and coupled with the price of the software is just too much in my opinion to spend. Based on some recommendations here, I purchased Turbo Tax Deluxe Federal Version (only) with Free e-file and since my state has a website to do the state taxes for free, I opted to do that. I am so glad that I read the reviews here because I never even knew that my state offered the ability to do my state taxes online .. and for Free! I couldn't be happier about the savings! As always Turbo Tax was fairly easy to use (took about an hour) and as it turns out my State taxes were easy too (took about 20 minutes).

1. Make sure your state offers the ability to do your taxes online and for free before purchasing this program.
2. Make sure you file your federal taxes first.
3. Then you can move on to your state taxes.

Side Note: In the state of Indiana, in order to do your state taxes on their website, it was required that I had filed Indiana state taxes in the previous year (this does not mean using their online ability last year, it just means I either mailed them in or efiled some other way for the state of Indiana). If your state offers the ability to do your taxes online, read their FAQ section to make sure you qualify to use their service before you purchase this product."
"Right now this is all the antivirus I have on my laptop. I get better protection from this than I did from iobit. Amazon has outdone itself with this free offer. I buy a lot from Amazon and find the whole company great, especially the freebies."

great GIFT. KEPT A FEW FOR MYSELF
Who wouldn't love a gift card to Texas Roadhouse.
Just what I needed.
"I love  the way the new interface looks!  It works perfectly and is pleasant to look at.  My only issue with it is that I am an everyday user of voice dictation software because I have a physical disability and I'm not able to type anyway for some reason when I am dictating an e-mail it does not dictate text in the proper location, I have just copied and pasted e-mails into the documents but it's still kind of annoying!"
"Did the job with no apparent errors. The tax software was easy to use. My only complaint is with the documentation of tax law.  The documentation is skimpy and does not really answer questions you might have abut the software. The tax law questions are easily answered with simple online searches, but software questions are just left hanging."
"This product is great for me as many of my devices do not have an optical drive. I just had to log on to my Norton account and add to my phone and tablets,  easy squeezy. Symantec is a trustworthy company that one of my best all time friends used to work for, and therefore I know that it is a great choice for internet security."
"I have owned the NV+ and this NVX is much better, read much faster.  It validated all the new disks I bought and said two of them were bad even though they worked in a PC.  It is very quiet and does not take much power.  Software is very versatile - lot of options and the web interface is very straight forward.  5 year warranty is also appreciated."
"I've actually worked my way up the Kaspersky product ladder and am currently using Kaspersky Pure (KP).  But before that I used Kaspersky Internet Security (KIS).  And before that, Kaspersky Anti-Virus (KAV).  With KAV I only used the anti-virus capabilities.  It has some other features for various types of other security enhancements, but I use some additional products for those other functions.  So all I needed was something to watch out for viruses.  There's not a single product I know that will catch 100% of everything, but Kaspersky consistently seems to do the best job of catching as much as possible while not bogging down my computer performance or generating false positives which can prevent other legitimate software from running.  The only reason I gave KAV 4 stars instead of 5 is because you can actually buy KIS for the same price or less, and it has all the features of KAV and then some.  I'd actually recommend upgrading to KP as it provides the best value."
"If you own your own business, QuickBooks is a necessary evil.  Luckily through the years, as the need for electronic bookkeeping has grown, so has the software.  After two years of unstable releases, QuickBooks 2010 put the software back on track by giving you all of the stability you loved in the last few versions along with a plethora of new features to keep you up-to-date in this electronic age.  The only issue I had was when I went to install the software on a virtual machine on a Mac.  In both Parallels 4.0 and vmfusion 3.0, QuickBooks had an issue reading the company file off of the virtual network drive.  The only current solution is to create a local copy in your virtual copy of windows.  Hopefully, QuickBooks can work out this kink sooner rather than later.  However, aside from this shortcoming, this is the best release of QuickBooks in years!"
"As someone who teaches graphic arts at the college level, I am very familiar with Adobe's various products, from Photoshop to Illustrator, etc.  I have been wanting to try out Corel Painter for a long time, as I had heard a lot of wonderful things about the program from a fellow graphic artist.  However, over the past 30 days of testing it out, I've found that there is a lot to both love and hate about this program...

Here's what is good:
- Comes with a TON of brushes that really help to bring out the creative side in one's artistry.
- Many of the tools are similar to Photoshop, so if you know Adobe's product, you'll be somewhat familiar with the workings of Corel's, as well.
- Comes with some handy features that allow you to easily transform photos into paintings.
- Artwork comes with a background texture that is similar to canvas or paper (you can choose the texture you wish to work with).
- Audio Expression provides brushes that react to your music.
- No monthly fee for usage of the product.

What's not so wonderful:
- This is a very powerful program and it can be quite overwhelming to someone who's absolutely brand new to it!

- There is a serious lack of training materials made available for this program.  If you check Amazon, you'll see that there are virtually zero training books available.  The software box provides only a DVD with the application alone on it.  No user guide is provided or obvious links to places where you can ""learn"" to use the application.  There are some YouTube videos available on the web, but I found them to be limited and confusing at times.

- Even with a modern MacBook Pro (with plenty of RAM and hard drive space on an SSD), some brushes tend to crawl slowly.  Nothing quite like watching a brush stoke take between 3 to 5 seconds before it would display on the screen.

- The audio expression is a neat idea, but I'm not too sure how practical it will actually be, as it's hard enough for a lot of artists to effectively communicate their creativity through a machine interface -- without the machine itself introducing unexpected chaos to it.  ;-)

Overall, if Adobe was to provide some quality training programs, this might be a good recommendation.  However, if you do not have someone to train you on this program, you might want to look elsewhere."
"I was very disappointed in Turbo Tax for the 2013 tax year.  When entering deductions, where you used to be able to just enter a figure from my Quicken Summary; you now have to break it down into multiple lines for the program to accept it.  Is this Intuit's idea of a positive Turbo Tax Update or is this the IRS cracking down and telling software companies to make it more difficult to take earned deductions???"
"I guess I'm a lone voice crying in the wilderness because I like this product.  I can't say that I've used every one of the dozens of features this software includes, but I haven't run into any problems so far - and it's nice to know that I now have the capability to do so many other things I would never have even thought about doing before.  The main draw for me was the video editing and DVD creation features - everything else in Roxio Easy Media Creator 10 Suite is just icing on the cake for me.  That being said, you are going to need a pretty good computer to make all of this magic happen. When I first got this product, I had a five-years-old XP machine with limited memory.  I had no trouble installing the software, but I was very limited in what I could do, especially in terms of video editing.  Now I have a Vista PC with 4 GB of RAM, which means I am pretty much ready to Roxio and roll.  I did have some trouble installing this on my new PC, but that was because my PC came with Roxio Creator DE and I didn't want to uninstall that until I knew this new software was working problem-free.  All I had to do to get past this was to kill my preexisting Roxio processes in the Task Manager before installing this new software.  It was easy to do - my only complaint was that I had to figure this out on my own, as it wasn't mentioned in the documentation.

So what all can this puppy do?  Let's start with the video options.  You can capture video directly or import it from your digital camcorder, rip it from your non-encrypted DVDs, edit it, save it, export it, watch it, convert it, etc.  You can even upload videos to YouTube in one quick step.  Now I can finally transfer some of my old analog video to digital - up until now, I could transfer video to DVD, but I couldn't transfer it to my computer or edit it at all.  That means I'll finally be able to post some video of my late, beloved canine buddy on YouTube.  You don't have to be a total AV geek to do this stuff, either.  If the thought of turning your old home video into a ""movie"" scares you, you can just make a few basic choices and let the software do it for you.  All of the advanced video editing features will still be there when you're ready for them.  This isn't the most powerful video editing software in the world, but it's more than most of us will ever need.  I just want to be able to share my home videos with family and friends, not try to follow in the footsteps of George Lucas.

You also have a lot of nice options for working with photos.  If you already have a good photo editing program like Photoshop or Fireworks, Roxio's Photo Suite has nothing to offer you, but it's a good, basic editor for newbies.  You can also create slideshows, panoramas, and other types of photo projects with this software.  Again, many users will already have bigger and better ways of doing the same thing, but I certainly don't begrudge the fact that these options are included here - and some will definitely find these things of use.  The same goes for the Roxio Media Manager, which includes the ability to synchronize photos and videos with any mobile device you might have.

Turning to audio, you get a myriad of features for ripping, burning, and organizing your files.  There's a Sound Editor that lets you add sound effects and/or edit and mix different audio tracks, a Batch Audio Converter that lets you convert your audio files to different formats, and a program that allows you to record analog audio from LPs and tapes (a Recording Setup Guide shows you how to hook the different components together).  If you're as old as I am, you have a lot of great music on LP and tape that you would love to have easier access to.  Roxio's Data and Backup utilities help you back up your important data files, a Disc Gallery lets you index all of the files on your discs, and Express Labeler and Label Creator make it easier to keep your discs organized.

I've just tried to give you a quick overview of the many different features included in this software package.  Suffice it to say that this thing will give you plenty of bang for your buck.  Chances are that you're going to have different software programs you prefer to use for different things, but Easy Media Creator Suite 10 is such a complete package of products that you're sure to find a use for it in a number of different ways.  I might still use ITunes for my music, Fireworks for my photo editing, and Windows Movie Maker for some of my video editing, but I'm still quite happy with this software package."
Very pleased with the gift card in a greeting card.  Nice way to give a gift.
"this product is very hard to find - and rare in department stores anymore.  I love the scent and always get compliments on it.  Can't stand Paris Hilton as a person, but dang, she makes a wonder perfume!"
"I actually did not have this on my computer very long.  I upgraded to it from KAV, and shortly after installing it I was able to upgrade to Kaspersky Pure.  I highly recommend Kasperksy Pure.  But that's another review.

I tend to use a cocktail of software products for security.  I like having one dedicated to anti-virus, and that's where Kaspersky Internet Security (KIS) comes in.  Although it has numerous security features such as identity protection functionality, parental controls, spam protection, etc. I am primarily concerned with its ability to detect and trap viruses, spyware, and similar problems.  I've yet to try any software that catches everything (and I've tried them all), but KIS does as good a job as any of them.  The other features are just gravy to me but I didn't extensively test them so I can't honestly say how well they stack up compared to the competition.

KIS didn't bog down my computer, and it played well with the OS and other programs.  It didn't produced any false positives that block legit software from running.  It did occasionally throw up some warning flags on some software that I had to manually mark as safe to prevent it from getting flagged every time I ran it.  But other than that I have no complaints."
I purchased this to upgrade my software.  I liked the multiple programs all in one.  I would definitely recommend this.
"Norton Security has been working fine for the last 6 years. But now it starts use popup advertisement for its new product. Norton, this is not a freemium, so stop the popup ads!!"
"I have been using Turbotax Deluxe to do my taxes every year since 1997 and really don't know how I could do it without them. It is fast, easy and very complete and it seems that they almost guarantee a refund every year. Hope they never let up!!!"
"Nancy Drew's 13th game finds her full steam ahead in pursuit of the ghostly legend of Jake Hurley. Jake had built a custom train that he and his wife Camille traveled on, but after Camille's mysterious, sudden death aboard the train, Jake, too, disappeared, the train found abandoned with the engineer dead at the wheel. The ""ghost train"" has been restored by socialite Lori Girard, who has invited several celebrities on the maiden voyage: television ghost hunter John Grey, famous historical romance novelist Charleena Purcell, hotshot detective Tino Balducci, Frank and Joe Hardy, and Nancy, of course. Soon after the train heads towards Copper Gorge, Lori disappears and it's up to Nancy to find out what happened to her. Along the way, clues to Camille's untimely death and Jake's legendary mine surface.

The modeling of the train cars is a pleasant departure from previous ND games. Scenery whips by outside the train windows, and you have to hop from train car to train car as the ground speeds by underneath. Chandeliers sway from the motion of the train. There is loving attention to detail in each room: period photographs, stitched samplers, and aged sheet music all create a believable atmosphere. In addition to the train, Nancy has the chance to disembark and explore Copper Gorge, Colorado.

There are several gameplay additions from previous ND games, including Nancy's camera cell phone and Frank and Joe Hardy (who have a relatively small role, although you do get to play as the Hardy Boys at one point in the game). Puzzles are creative, with some HerInteractive standards such as the ""make your own sandwich"" standby, but others (such as a music-related puzzle) were a welcome breath of fresh air that built on HerInteractive's solid reputation as a producer of non-violent, girl-friendly games that emphasize creative problem solving. Clues are just obvious enough without giving away answers, strategically placed and cleverly hidden.

Overall, I thought the ending a bit weak (too many loose ends for my taste), and the much-hyped Hardy Boys underutilized, but the solid gameplay and gorgeous graphics more than make up for it. A wonderful addition to a groundbreaking line of girls' software, ""Blue Moon Canyon"" is sure to delight."
"There are serious compatability and speed issues with Vista.  Count on much of your current bussiness software not to run.  Count on having difficulty downgrading back to Windows XP as Microsoft has rigged Vista to make it difficult to downgrade without buying a new XP from them

Vista is processor and memory heavy.  It will dramatically slow older computers.  Even with a newer computer it may appear no faster than windows xp and possibly slower.  I however, have the home edition on my brand new home computer and it is plenty fast.  However, the premium and business editions are much slower and require more memory.

I recommend never to put Vista on a computer with less than a duo core processor and 2 MB of memory.  All businsess owners should stay away for at least a year until all compatability issues have been resolved - assuming that is possible."

"Well phooey. I ordered this 2009 version, expecting it to surely work with my pre-release version of Microsoft Windows 7, but that turned out not to be possible. The installation disk did not recognize Windows 7 as a supported version. I then attempted to load the pre-release version available within Windows 7 itself, only to discover that version didn't fully work either, with the vendor's discussion board stating Windows 7 isn't officially supported yet.

I then tried installing the program on a Windows XP machine, only to discover after installation that it is incompatible with the free version of Zone Labs' firewall I've carefully tuned over a period of years.

It's nice such packages are now covering more security bases for users, but I'm a fan of using best-of-breed products, and only wanted this to be an anti-virus, not also a firewall or anti-spam product. At the very least, I'd like to be able to choose at install time which aspects of the program I wish to use.

Next time I need to build an XP PC from scratch, I'll try this again, but for now, much as I looked forward to trying this product, it's shelfware."
"Microsoft Word 2010 builds on an idea that Microsoft is famous for, which is to refine the dashboard of the car, not the engine or performance of the car, building on an already successful overload of bloated and reckless programming. I can't 100% vouch for this, because I don't work for Microsoft, but this program is yet another example of where Microsoft completely depends on the fact that many businesses and end users are ONLY familiar with Word, and little else. Had this not been the case, Microsoft Word would be an incredibly awful piece of over-priced, bloated, buggy software.

Still chock full of inconsistencies and performance/reliability issues, it's possible that much of the talent behind this program is fresh meat or Microsoft didn't seem to put much effort into Design Verification testing. Other similar Word Processors seems to be less crash-prone in Windows than Microsoft's very own Word Processor. I will defend Word here, that the Auto-Save/recovery technology is pretty good....and necessary.

Now, the more frustrating thing I find that this program does NOT do well, is to give the end user a way to move objects, pictures, boxes, and charts around the page without utterly and completely destroying certain aspects of page formatting. There are some facets that Word can handle well, such as the realization that the end user wants each new line to continue with a number, bullet, Bold, etc. but outside of that, Word is pretty, well....dumb. It also seems Microsoft, as usual just makes it more complex and frustrating by changing where things are like a department store. This simply DOESN'T work for end users. Ever complain that your local grocer re-arranged the store, and now you have to spend twice as long re-orienting yourself with the layout, and having to ask for help twice as often?  Even the help isn't very intelligent or useful? Sound familiar? It is here.

I will still use Word, because like I said, it's what I'm very familiar with, but I still curse at it often. I actually found it more enjoyable to take a week to learn Adobe's InDesign to accomplish much of what Word never could dream of doing on a page. Like some very prominent authors state they use Word for writing, they certainly don't use it for any type of finished product. Not that Word is expected to be a full-on publishing application, but with the price Microsoft puts on Word it should at least try and compete beyond the limits of freeware.

Conclusion: If you're only familiar with Word, and you are required to use it, or have many people you send/receive documents from that use Word, stick with it and you'll survive life. If not, give some other programs like OpenOffice a good whirl until Microsoft can at least work out their own internal incompatibilities and inconsistencies, while hopefully taking better control of their own pricing."
"Thanks to all the other raters, I won't use TurboTax any more.  So I can't rate the product but I wanted another ""1 star"" to be added.  Like someone else said, we should be able to give it zero stars.  The Turbotax people must be nuts!  The $10 extra charge for each return is bad enough but what really makes me angry is how they're trying to hide it so the average user will just buy it, then pay the extra money because that would be easier than returning the software.  How sneaky.  I don't know about you but I don't forget things like this!"
"I have an 8 year old computer that I put this on and this software installed like a dream.  In case you don't have a dvd, they give you a link to download from, and then you could use the product key that comes with it.
Activation was not an issue for me - it went quickly and there was nothing to fill out as I already have a LiveID.  (I have had to call with some MS products before and it drives me crazy!)
I planned a yard sale route this morning and it gave me the quickest way to get to all the sales!  I'll be using it every weekend I go for this!  Just get your paper or your addresses. Everything goes right to your GPS too!
Now, the feature I want to rave on the most is the coupons feature.  This one feature is my favorite - you can put in your trip route or just search by city or location, and the software will find all the places that have coupons available, and you can print them out.  There's a LOT of bogo restaurant coupons and I saw a lot of 50% hotel coupons for the Southeastern area.  There's even some retail coupons offered.  Just find your area and then click control +J and it will give you a list of what is available.
I never even realized what a great bargain hunter's dream this software was!  I thought it was just for sticking maps in documents or route planning for businesses.  I've already been telling my bargain hunting friends to check out the free 60 day trial."

"Used TM for several years.  Since installing this version I experienced long boot times and disk churning.  Went so far as to replace the hard drive and reinstall windows 7.  Finally dug deeper and found ""coreservices.dll"" was using almost 100% of my CPU time.  Searched it and found it was Titanium's main/core background service.  Searched TM site and found two patches and neither fixed it.  Nuked Titanium and all is now well.  TM later got back to me for a round of ""blame the customer"" support. Been there, done that. Too late.  Plus they wanted to remotely logon to my PC from the Philippines to diagnose it.  NO WAY!

Now using BitDefender Family Pack.  Supports all my family and all our devices for $69.99/year.  That's two PC's, two notebooks, one tablet and two phones.  Best feature is that it is totally out of my face.  A truly silent sentry.  Can't believe I put up with TM's malware for so long.  I let a wolf into the hen house.  Stupid me."
no trip to the mall! Yay!
"Stopped Virus Melt virus when McAfee didn't! We have three computers and are running three different virus software packages, so I've based my review on comparing the three products. On the one with PC Tools Internet Security 2009, we're using Vista and haven't had any problems with intrusions or slowing since installing PC Tools.  We installed Spyware Doctor on our systems and ran the scan over McAfee and Zone Alarm.  It caught more intrusions than McAfee.  PC Tools Spyware Doctor is a great product and seems to work better than spyware by McAfee and as well as Zone Alarm. Another plus, PC Tools is easy to load and use for novice users."
"This is one of my favorites in the series, but when playing this game I often found that they tried force too much history on you.  Other than that it's a great game, and I have the following comments on it:

Story-You have a summer internship working at a Mayan museum in Washington D.C.  For those of you who don't know, the Mayan civilization was an Indian civilization that vanished without a trace.  Anyway, you are doing basic chores when a certain artifact is stolen, and a scarlet hand print is left at the scene of the crime.  Hence the title.  Eventually, you solve this mystery only to have another one thrown at you in the middle of the game, so you are actually getting 2 stories in 1.

Graphics-These are pretty good graphics, with the backgrounds looking pretty real.  The characters still look definitely fake, but this has pretty good graphics still.

Sound-The music is okay with kind of a Mayan twist on it, but the voice acting really isn't that great.  And the lips are REALLY off.  I ignore it, and it doesn't bother me, but others it might bother a little bit.

Gameplay-The gameplay is exactly the same as the others in the series.  It is first person point-and-click.  You ride a metro system to get places, and the alarm clock is back, allowing you to go to sleep and wake up anytime you want.  The puzzles in this game are a little more difficult and numerous than in other games, and some of them are quite boring, but most are fun, and I can forgive the ones that aren't.

Fun-This game is pretty fun, but unlike the other games where there is just a tad bit of learning mixed in among the mystery, in this game, prepare to learn a LOT about Mayan history.  I hated it, because I hate history, but my friend loved it because he likes history.  I think the producers were just trying to appeal to history lovers as well as mystery lovers in this game, and I understand that.  No bad enough to give 3 stars, but not good enough for 5.

Length-Oh.  My.  Goodness.  This is a rather long game.  It took me several months to finish, and whenever I replay it (which is a lot) it will take me about 12-15 hours because I still have trouble with some of the puzzles!

The puzzles are hard, but the answers are in the game, you just have to look for them.  The history is boring, but the story is great!  A great addition for history buffs, but if you don't like history, this game is still worth playing through at least once!"
I bought this for my wife but I find tons of useful articles and actually have really enjoyed receiving the publication.
Poorest operating system Microsoft ever made. Longest boot time. Massive ram and disc space required. Use Windows 7 instead.
Great recipes! I love this magazine!
"GUEST REVIEWER  ! MRS KNOW IT ALL ;b

This software package gives you a lot more for your money.  AVG internet security 2011 software will protect your PC from malware, malicious sites, spam filtering and not tax your computers speed.  The best part is that this software includes free identity theft recovery service and a PC tune-up utility (free one-time usage, then you have to pay).  I like the ability to at least be able to see what the tune-up utility will find----then I can run it once and then look FREE software to do the same trick.  The things I don't like about this software is that this software is not that good at removing detected malware, antiphishing is not that accurate, and the sets can be complicated to set up.  I don't think I could trust this product to give the full protection I need, so I am going to pass."
"I tried this version of Trend Micro after using the 2010 version.  I installed it on a PC I built in 2008 which is using an Intel Core 2 Duo E8500 Wolfdale running at 3.16 Ghz on an Asus Rampage Formula motherboard, and 4GB of DDR2-1066.  The PC is currently running Windows 7 x64.

Installation of the software was easy.  The user interface seems to have been refined over the years, and it is very straightforward and intuitive.  Instead of replacing the Windows firewall, the 2012 version enhances the Windows firewall configuration.  They call it the ""Windows Firewall Booster.""

The AV component of this SW suite seems fairly robust.  They added a ""Fake AV Cleaner"" protection which targets malware that poses as antivirus software (shamefully, I have fallen victim to that in the past).  Scan times are about typical for a modern AV product, and a full scan always takes longer that you might expect.  My only complaint with this is the power saving scheme kicked in and put my PC top sleep during a full scan, so upon resuming the scan was sort of ""frozen"" and I had to restart it.

I don't use parental controls, so I can't comment on that aspect of the software.  I am happy with the fact that TM doesn't constantly pop annoying alerts and warnings - for the most part it runs silently until there is a danger requiring user intervention to solve.  I also don't use the backup feature - I have my own backup scheme.

I did try the System Tuner feature, and it basically does the same thing that something like CCleaner would do.  Actually, I prefer CCleaner.  I also run Spybot (another product) periodically and it finds things that TM does not.

Overall, I like TM over something like Norton - TM seemed to install cleaner and seems to have greater performance, though I have seen some reviews that question both of these aspects.  For my installation, I did not have these issues.  I think this version improves many of the things in the 2010 version, and seems to be stable and unobtrusive.  The real bottom line is ""would I buy the next version""...and I think I would."
"Just re-subbed. Love the magazine. It's straight-forward, doesn't try to sell me $500 kitchen candle holders, or talk about vacations in Tuscany and how we should all pop over there. (I'm eyeballing you, Rachael Ray.)  The magazine works very well with their website although you can use one without the other. I really enjoy, and am happy for, the ""From Our Kitchen"" comments on the recipes. Unlike some of the major cooking magazines I find myself trying out recipes from AllRecipes more often. These are recipes tried out by People, not just one celebrity chef of the moment. There are a variety of skill levels involved so there is something for almost everyone. If you are a cook who utilizes ingredients only found under the full blue moon while riding a unicorn and costs $20 per tsp., perhaps this is not the magazine for you."
"I have a PowerMac G5 and Dell notebook. The notebook went bad so purchase MacBook with Windows XP and Parallels. After working all day getting Parallels and Windows installed and up and running, I thought my life was great. Then after a week things quite working. Parallels would not boot Windows no matter what I tried. The manual is not written for the average business user and has several mistakes in it. They provide an additional manual to try to correct the mistakes in the first manual with such things as, "" on Page 3 replace step 4 with the following . . . next place the content of . . .  in the second bullet, the name should be corrented . . ."" Then you have to go to their website to find corrections to these corrections. The manual is written in true computer geek language and not for the person that doesn't make his living working on and with computers. Parallels offers support at $30/call or by email that doesn't work. They only work during business hours on West coast time. Suggestion - if you need Windows, buy a PC of Boot Camp."
Bought for our parents - they love these because you can use these at the theater for tickets and concession.  You don't have to book online!  Our parents prefer to go to the theater and make their decisions.
"I've been using the service on and off for years so I've got a long, though not expert background in their software.  The thing I used to hate about them was the interface of their software.  Their databases were awesome, but the software left much to be desired.  About five years or so ago they redesigned their software suite.  At first the improved interface was beset with a lot of teething problems.  I stayed away for a few years and finally came back last year and picked up the 2011 version.  That was a HUDGE leap forward over what I was used too.  Better interface, better web integration, better features.

I got the chance to try out the 2012 version so I decided to give it a try.  So far I don't see a lot of changes from 2011.  I just recently tried the iPhone app.  That was clever, and I've used it a few times to look up something during a lunch conversation, but I don't see it being of real use to me.  If you find yourself in the library a lot this would probably be a great way to update information.

So if you've got an old version of FTM then I say go for the upgrade.  If you've got the 2011 version then I don't see a big reason to make the leap."
Good Gift
"This shoe is JUST OK. Its not as comfortable as I was expecting, compared to my last pair of NIKE shoes. I hope they hold up."
"I have printshop 20.  It spoiled me.  It had no bugs that I ever found.  Printshop 3.0 on the hand has more bugs than I can count.  It seems that they cut a lot of corners in testing this software.  When typing, the marker where you are, it disapears. I am thinking of going back to 20.

Since I 1st wrote this review I have been trying to print envelopes.  I have never had more problems. The print instructions call out landscape mode but the program prints in partially in the potrait mode and most of it not at alll. When trying to contact Broderbund I go in circles.  They won't answer their phone.  They support center says I can send an email, but that part does not work.  One star rating is too much.
Continued efforts have gotten answers.  But not to my questions.  They answer the question, but not to the question I asked.  I have upgraded to 3.0.5 and still no solutions to the problems.  I think they are having great financial problems

How would you like to make a card with lots of stuff and it won't let you print.  Instead it crashes and you lose everything.  I keep looking for and update that makes it more useable but so far no luck."
"Hi!

I loaded this product and when attempting to load state the software asked for an ADDITIONAL $34.95.  When I contacted TurboTax on-line they first told me it was not yet available, then said ""All 2006 and 2007 TurboTax Federal Packages include state.""  We will see.  I have a sneaking suspicion I've been had."
"Great when u don""t have money to go out. Cracker barrel is the best food."
"For those that need a basic accounting system, this is probably a good system.  It is easy to install on the computer system and it is fairly simple to install.  What you need to do is evaluate what you need and make sure that this is what you need.

What you need to do in choosing an accounting system is to determine what you business needs are and if this needs them.  No review is going to tell you this. Choice of an accounting system is very personal and the wrong decision can hurt your business.  Therefore, I will not list the pluses and minuses of this as an accounting system.  What I will say is that it is user friendly."
"I honestly hadn't used a WordPerfect product in over a decade before trying this. I rememberd much preferring it to the early versions of Word and MS Works, but that's not saying a whole lot after so many years. Since that time I had become accustomed to Microsoft Office XP and then Office 2003, while more recently using Oracle's open-source [...] project (which is a great option for many home users). I have grown tired with Microsofts GUI updates in their last two versions of Office, so it's nice to see Corel go with an interface that's instantly recognizable to anyone who's used a word processor without any ""Huh? What's that button there for?"" moments. Word/Office may have been a more intuitive and user-friendly program at one time, but that ended with Office 2003.

Document compatibility is another area where WordPerfect Office X5 excels. Of course it has its own file format, but it also supports Microsoft's new OOXML formats, as well as [...]'s ODF formats. While that's not an absolute guarantee that it can open every file properly (especially when it comes to Word document formatting), that does make it one of the most compatible Office suits right out of the box, without having to download any kind of viewers or file converters (which Microsoft can't even do between its own lines of products). In fact, out of the box Office X5 supports over 60 different file types.

WordPerfect X5 is what this suite is named after, but the other applications are also noteworthy, particularly Lightning, which acts as a document organizer and information manager. Quattro Pro X5 and Presentations X5 do pretty good impressions of Excel and PowerPoint, respectively, while Nuance Paperport 12 SE is there for document scanning, imaging and management (please note that this version of Nuance Paperport is not really the full version, some features are limited). If there's one weakpoint, it's the inclusion of Mozilla Thunderbird. While it's a great e-mail client (I use it at home), it's simply not good when compared to Outlook when in a Microsoft Exchange environment. Thanks to Microsoft's proprietary files, Thunderbird just doesn't seem to be a good match for Exchange, when it's even an option. Sure, there are ways to configure it to make it work, but it's hard to recommend it over Outlook in that case. If you run a small business and just need a simple e-mail client for POP3 and IMAP accounts, then it gets a hearty recommendation.

All-in-all, WordPerfect Office X5 is a recommended and much more user-friendly affair than recent offerings from Microsoft. Throw in the fact that it's a good bit less expensive and has a wide breadth when it comes to office suite compatibility (it can handle anything the MS Office and OpenOffice can throw at it), and it may be the best bet for your office."
"I've been using Video Studio off and on for years and while it has nice features, I've always been disappointed over the speed and overall function of the suite. This suite they finally got things right. Not only is the program snappier and smoother than ever but we finally have some really good features as well. As a long time Adobe Premiere Elements fan, I have to say this may become my video suite of choice."
"A way to track your stolen laptop or computer, sounds great.  What you're buying is not software, but rather an activation number for this software through the Norton website.  It installs easily, but I didn't have the need to track my device.  However, assuming it got stolen, tracking my iPhone or laptop would have limited utility.  My inner city Police Department isn't going to be interested that I can track my missing iPhone to a region of the city, nor would I confront a thief over an iPhone.  The security this service provides is suspect at best and since there are plenty of free apps overing a similar sense of false security, there are more economical choices if you're interested.  Not recommended."
Have used TT for years. Easy to use. With step by step instructions
"Avoid this product at all costs, unless you want headache after headache using your computer.  I can't even begin to describe the frustration with  this product.  I'm so mad that I've had to waste hour after hour trying to complete the most basic tasks with Windows 8.  What worked yesterday, doesn't work today. What works tomorrow, won't work the next day. Nothing is compatible, files get lost, the program seems to think on its own, incorrectly almost continuously.  I HATE IT!  Who ever had this hair-brained idea?"
"First, let me say I love Corel products - menus are intuitive, easy to load, easy to use. Corel Ulead VideoStudio was no exception.

For under $100 (list price of $129, Amazon price is currently $59), please do not expect professional editing software. I found no problems whatsoever in my experiments, but I'm a complete novice in video editing, was not working with large files or Hi-Def.

Most importantly, please note that a newer version of this software (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-VideoStudio-Pro-X4/dp/B004PIPG2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel VideoStudio Pro X4</a>) is available for the same price or less (list price of $99, Amazon price is currently $59).

Nonetheless, I believe this version (11.5+) is still valid (works with Win XP/Vista/7). HOWEVER, Pro X4 has a LOT of new features I wish I could play with: stop motion tools, time-lapse effects, create/burn in Blue-Ray, add 3D (even includes glasses) ... so unless you find a deep discount on the old version, check out the new version first. (And, I hear rumors that a Pro X5 will be released soon)."
"We're only a few days into this an we have picked up a few catch phrases already. It's also neat because it has a level 1 companion app that you can take with you. It has 3 levels, from beginner to intermediate. It comes with 1 software DVD program and 1 interactive DVD. My favorite is the CD that contains 10 hours of audio listening, so I can drive while learning. It has a computer called Who is Oscar Lake & a pocket  phrase guide. Level 1 starts off with vocabulary, level 2 expands to the complex phrase and conjugations of the verbs & pronunciations, level 3 gives you some advanced dialogue and conversation. I like everything that comes with this package. our family will definitely benefit from it. Worth the money if you'd like to expand your knowledge of the Spanish language."
"In the Nebraska state tax, they referred to a Nebraska form, but the form was not supplied by TurboTax, and I had to search for it and determine if it was relevant to the return I was preparing.  Also, it would be helpful to have an ""EXPRESS"" finish preparing where after all the income items are covered one can then just finish by only taking the standard deduction instead of having to go through everything in the deductions section just to end up being told that the standard deduction is the way to go."
"After several years of using other security programs, I tried Norton 360 for 3 PCs.  It was far better than any others I have used before. Now my wife and I have tablets as well, so the 360 for 5 devices was perfect.  It works on PCs, Macs, or Android devices (iOS devices get partial protection).

Installation was almost automatic. The license lets you install the software from their website with just one key. You can then manage all protected devices from your online account and move protections around as your collection of devices changes.

Norton 360 offers a password management feature, which is really handy. This feature stores usernames, passwords and credit card numbers and then fills in the information when opening your password-secured websites. That is very convenient if you have several online accounts.

Additional PC features include tune-up, backup and restore utilities. Norton includes a proprietary two-way PC firewall. Windows already comes with a firewall, but some people like the idea of having their firewall and anti-malware software come from a single source. The PC Tuneup cleans up Windows temporary files, Internet Explorer temporary files, Internet Explorer history cleanup, startup manager, registry cleanup and disk optimization.

The PC portion includes parental controls management. You can block access to sites that you don't want kids to visit and you can track where they go on the internet.

 The Safe Search Toolbar installs automatically so you can search safely right from your browser. There are plenty of search toolbars available.  I like having one that matches my PC security package.

Bottom line: Easy to install and covers just about everything I need.  What more could I ask for?"
"I just finished installing this software on several devices - Android phone, Windows 7 desktop, and two Windows 8 laptops.  So far, I like what I'm seeing.

First, the installation is very easy.  None of my devices has a DVD drive anymore and instead I use a portable one.  This software is convenient because it simply includes a code so that you can create a McAfee account.  After you create an account, you can download the software onto any device of your choosing.  McAfee makes it easy to install the software on phones/tablets by sending you a link to download the software to your device.

I also like that when installing to Windows devices, you can choose which features you want installed.  For instance, I have no use for parental notifications, so I turned those off.  All of the different features can be installed or not installed depending on your preference.

The first thing I did on my PCs was run a scan for potential viruses/security issues.  I was previously running Norton and it must have done a good job because the scan found nothing suspicious.

I also installed the software on my Android phone.  The installation went smoothly and I chose my settings.  Then I went online to make sure the device locator was working and was happy to see that it had an accurate location for my phone.  Then, came the frustrating part.  Apparently, one of the settings added a little tab on the right hand side of my phone that shows alerts for various issues.  I tried going through every setting I could find to remove it.  I don't like the way it looks since it overlaps with apps.  I don't understand why these notices aren't put in the notice bar, like every other program.  To get rid of it temporarily, I was able to drag and drop it into a garbage bin.  Again, why not put this in a notification tray and allow me to swipe it away?  Dragging it up to a garbage can is awkward.  Of the two notifications I have receive so far, one was a warning about one of my apps not meeting their security standards and the other was asking if I wanted to close all of my open programs.  The first one made sense to me and I uninstalled that app.  The second one was just irritating.

I tried contacting McAfee through chat three times.  The first time, the screen just loaded forever.  The second time, the chat window wouldn't open.  The third time, the chat window opened, but after waiting for 6 minutes for a representative, I received a notice saying that a technician had ended my session.  I give up.  This is just too frustrating.  The software works well on my computers, but it's obvious the mobile device version needs work.  I would try to connect to McAfee again, but it doesn't appear there's an option to email them - just chat or phone.  Every time I try to reconnect, it makes me enter all of my information again.  After three strikes, they are out."
"I've been using Family Tree Maker for a number of years, mostly on Windows.  So this is my first Mac version, but I've been around the software before and use it extensively with ancestry.com sync features.  At first glance, FTM for the Mac 3 Deluxe seems to be fairly feature complete, on par with the Windows version.  Of course, it's also a bit sluggish, which I've come to expect from the FTM products.

Now, while I have used FTM for a number of years, by no means am I a genealogical expert.  It's all personal use and it often comes in spurts.  I use the software to update a family tree on occasion and likely don't come back to it for several months to a year.  Like other FTM products, it comes with a three month subscription to ancestry.com.  Syncing with the online tree is great and has been much improved over the years.

It does an excellent job of tracking changes and keeping your tree(s) in sync.  The interface is nice with a UI that is easy to navigate.  There are plenty of printing and viewing options.  There are times that grabbing online content and waiting for things to process is sluggish.  Again, I've grown accustomed to this over the years with FTM.  Each version seems to get a little better, but there's often a few quarks to get used to.  Overall, a nice family tree product with syncing and plenty of features to keep you busy on your various genealogical projects."
"I have been using system mechanic at least 5 years. A few months ago I renewed on line and was offered version 11 free upgrade. After the download is when problems started to happen. IOLO top notch tech in India told me that Install Shield was a virus that was stopping the downloads and he could fix that for $200.00. I also us Norton Internet Security. When update definitions don't download, system mechanic really slows your computor down, I have XP,Vista and Windows 7 computors. Windows 7 is the only one that is working correctly and I have removed system mechanic from my XP and Vista systems . I suspect that version 11 is not compatibly with XP or Vista. And so far IOLO has not admitted it. Bottom line is I am looking for another software for my XP and Vista."
"Great applications if you have a Mac.  Very compatible with mac but if you are familiar with Microsoft Office, the transition is a little difficult."
Lots of learning opportunities for any age reader.  I do not approve of some of the ads for young readers in our school library.
"I wasn't surprised that I'm the only one having problems installing this. The manual is on the disk, so no help THERE. Try to install it and wait. And wait. And wait. And then when it's done, nothing. Doesn't boot. And no help, cause the help you need is on the program that won't run!

I had to uninstall another program to put this monster on. Total frustration!

N.B. Another user who went through the Facebook route (and got nowhere from the company) said another user told him to click ""no"" to updates, and that made it work. If I have the patience, I may try that. Otherwise, this is going to be lining my trashcan."
absolulty easy to handle . the new's  features  compare to old video studio pro  made a video pro x4  more  freanly and easy to do a nice video show and some effects. recomended software.
"I just bought another copy of the ""older"" N360 2013 for the new registation Key, but I've been running this newer ""2014"" version for a few months already. Norton has the nice feature of alway being able to upgrade to the latest version as long as your subcription is still current. I have a little over 2 months left on my current N360 subscription and saw the 2013 version available a  nice price here on Amazon, so I bought another 3PC one user box. I have to wait untill my current subscription expires or a day or so untill it does to enter the new KEY, because if I did it now, I would lose the remainder of my current subscription.

OK, I've said enough that is not really review material, but should be useful to anybody using Norton.
Review-wise, I think Norton 360 is a great product and works well for me. The only issue I have with it is the stupid cloud based  (these days) password ""vault"". I preferred the older, local  password manager, which on one of my PC's, is the way I still have it set up. I made the mistake of logging onto Symantec one day with my user ID and password, and it kind of ""Grabbed"" my password manager and made it the cloud based vault thing, which sounded OK, but when I logged into it with my Laptop, which had fewer log-ins and passwords, it for some crazy reason synched the cloud data FROM my laptop. When I used my desktop next time, the Cloud password data got synched TO my desktop and I lost 3/4 of my log ins and passwords. Fortunately, I back up my passwords to a local hardrive file with a built in, but awkward to find utility in Norton to import or export, and I was able to get it all back.
Other than that quirk. I like the software a while lot. It runs smotthly, and does not cause my PC's to crash. That IS pretty bad, but I was able to recover."
"I JUST READ IT TODAY, THEY STILL MAKE YOU GO TO THE SITE AND JOIN.  THEY KEEP TALKING ABOUT QUICK WEIGHT LOSS BUT I HAVE BEEN ON WEIGHT WATCHERS BEFORE AND IT TAKES TIME."
"I've long looked to Ulead VideoStudio as the best amateur video editing software out there, so I'm happy to finally get the chance to compare this package to those I've used in the past, namely the ubiquitous Windows Movie Maker and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roxio-Easy-Media-Creator-Suite-10/dp/B000UJUJ7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite 10</a>.  I have to make clear here that I'm wholly an amateur when it comes to video editing (as anyone who has seen one of my YouTube videos could tell you), so all of the technical specs of software such as this are quite over my head.  The beauty of this product, though, is that it meets the needs of the newbie just wanting to edit his home movies as and offers up a huge buffet of options for advanced amateurs who know all of the acronyms, like to argue with other gurus about formats and resolutions, and produce darn-near professional quality videos for any and all occasions.  The software may initially look difficult to learn and use, but it doesn't take long to learn the basics - and then you can learn more advanced features at your own pace.

It goes without saying that you're going to need a pretty powerful computer if you want to use this software without tearing your hair out.  The system requirements are, in my opinion, something of a joke.  There's no way I would try running this with a mere 512 MB of RAM (or, in the case of Vista, even 1 GB); I would recommend at least 1 GB of RAM on Windows XP and 2 GB on Vista - anything less, and you're just asking for problems.  Memory becomes even more of an issue if you're going to be taking advantage of the wealth of HD capabilities this package boasts.  Those HD capabilities really are a big selling point, by the way (as you can tell just by a quick perusal of the box cover or product summary).  You certainly aren't going to be saving any HD videos to Blu-Ray using Windows Movie Maker.

The package comes with an impressive number of templates, filters, effects, etc., and the complete novice can rely on wizards to help him/her put together an impressive project.  Once you've mastered the basics, you have all kinds of enhancement options to choose from.  If you've thought about paying someone to put together a slideshow using old family pictures, forget about it.  It's easy to create a slideshow of images in VideoStudio, and you can basically control every aspect of the production, from inserting music to specifying the transformation settings from any one image to another.  It's almost as easy to create a video and truly customize it to your desires.  One particularly nice feature is the ability to add a voice track as well as a music track rather than limiting the user to one ""audio"" track.  You can also insert multiple overlays, which is another powerful feature.  And you can export your finished projects all sorts of ways: to your PC, to DVD, to online sites such as YouTube, and to iPods and a number of other portable devices.

VideoStudio isn't perfectly intuitive.  For example, you have a plethora of formats in which you can render a given file, but the rendering option is by no means prominent on the display.  I would also like to have seen some kind of cheat sheet for basic operations included alongside the manual, but I have to say this product manual itself isn't all that bad (although, as with most such software, your best source for information and guidance can probably be found in online forums and the like).  The manual is especially instructive in terms of setting things up and connecting to different digital and even analog video sources.

As far as the installation goes, I had no problems whatsoever (for the record, I'm running Vista with 4 GB of RAM).  Right off the bat, it came up saying I needed Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable SP1 Package and Microsoft DirectX Feb2006 Runtime, but the setup program installed those for me.  From then on, it was smooth sailing, including the extras that come on the bonus CD: WinDVD 8, MediaOne Plus Photo & Video Manager, and ULead Disc Image Recorder.

The bottom line in this: Ulead VideoStudio 11.5 Plus is, in my opinion, the best and most economical video editing program for amateurs on the market.  Even if you're only interested in making the most basic of videos for any purpose, I would definitely recommend that you take a look at this package."

"Ok, I got my 2nd issue just after I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. So all her lovely desserts and high-carb treats are off limits now. So I MAY be bitter. Just a bit.
That being said, nothing really sets this mag apart from the other ""foodies"", other than maybe some cachet for her name. It's dessert-heavy (as are most) and too too many recipes call for something I don't keep on hand and wouldn't buy anyway. Artichoke hearts? Lemon grass? Fresh chard? REALLY?
Healthy and fun eating doesn't require fresh mango Vidalia chutney or seared Alaskan You've-Never-Heard-Of. If you love using unusual ingredients, making aoli, trying the newest thing, and have access to these ingredients, snap this up. There are tons of recipes and ideas in each issue, and the tone is very loose and friendly. Me, I'd rather have a down-to-earth well-seasoned grilled chicken breast with veggies."

"MS manage to change the Interface again.  For existing users of Windows, this beast takes some time to get used to.  I find myself constantly looking at help, looking for some stupid menu item.  It makes experienced user feels like ignorant as the Windows beginners.
Comes with many small programs, but many times, I rather pay for professional software than deal with more of MS [stuff].  All this unwanted features gets in the way of accomplishing my goals.
Comming from Windows 2000, I did not see much of speed advantage.
Beginners of Windows may like all the extra featurs, but as an experienced user, I cannot get any work done with this POS."
this is a very good product. Works good and does what it is supposed to do. My computer works smoothly. recommended.
Look great
Color was not at all what i expected.  It was more orange then red.  Not sure that I am going to keep them.
"Over the years I've run the gamut of anti-virus software from venerable companies like Norton and McAfee to lesser known brands like Trend Micro and Kaspersky. With my latest subscription to McAfee coming due I was looking for a change. Don't get me wrong, overall I think the McAfee product did exactly what I'd hoped it would do - keep my PCs relatively safe and free from malware. However, the well documented trade-offs had finally worn me down to the point that I was constantly annoyed with McAfee's impacts to system performance and constant interruptions.

I've been using Webroot AV 2016 for two full months and I really like this software. Compared to similar products from McAfee, Norton, and Trend the Webroot AV product is incredibly lightweight. There is a systemic ""minimalist"" approach to this software that extends from the installation of the product to running scans and to system performance. Webroot has seemingly listened to the legions of AV users who complain repeatedly about the same things - intrusive, bloated AV software stinks. So the emphasis with Webroot is speed.

Overall I'm pleased with the product. It's extremely fast and probably the least intrusive AV program I've ever uses. Based on my limited testing and research Webroot seems to perform quite well at detecting and stopping intrusive known malware. The key here is known. In several reviews I've read the Achilles heel of this software seems to be it's performance in detecting zero-day malware or otherwise unknown/new malware that hasn't had time to make it into known malware definitions. Most AV programs scan the host for indicators that zero-day threats are present. In this regard it seems Webroot doesn't perform quite as well and significantly lags other major AV companies.

So there remains a trade-off even with Webroot. Ultimately decide what's best for your machines and household based on your use. Certainly I wouldn't recommend this software to everyone. However, paired with individual good security practices and awareness of threats I think Webroot can be a great software."
"This is a good product, but it's not completely intuitive, there's a big learning curve to get over to get the most out of this, and at this point I'm still climbing that curve.  Don't get me wrong, I like this product and feel that I'll get even better results with it once I'm more comfortable using it.  I've used other video editing software, so this product compares nicely with the rest.

The installation didn't go smoothly.  I actually had to try installing this three times before it worked.  I don't think this is normally the case, but I did want to mention it.  I also think that the disc with the extras could be a bit easier to install.  As it is, you've got to go through the process for each bonus features you want added to the program.  It would be much easier to have some check boxes and pick the ones you want and go through this process once.  Just a suggestion.

This is a feature rich suite, with plenty of nice feature to get you started producing some great video.  Take the time to get up to speed on using it for best results."
"I'm not hugely experienced using Roxio Creator.  I've almost always had one version or another of Roxio Creator, and find that I mostly use it for converting my cd's to different audio formats for use on different devices, or for making fun cd's for the car of favorites.

I also tend to use it when making data cds as I can't find the software my laptop came with for doing that.  I can find this one every time and it is pretty easy to use.

As for use, it is fairly easy to use - you select what you want to do, then follow the steps.  I like that Roxio has made it so easy this way.

I didn't realize I could convert video specifically for my Kindle Fire, but Roxio makes that possible too - that is on my to-do list, but I haven't tested that section yet.

This is my go-to software for converting music and burning discs."
"Okay, this order did not come yet. But I have some windows 8 experience via College classes. This product is not that bad, I don't really need a touchscreen for this (even though I'd wished touchscreen desktops would be available) but its tempting because basically this software was designed for a touchscreen. I have a copy (trail for VMWare, a software for Data communications class aka DCOM) of Windows 8 Enterprise. Was confusing at first, but fun once I got the hang of it. I have windows 7 professional on my laptop but I will use windows 8 for my new built desktop (Almost finished). This is not a bad product, you just have to adjust to it, after all, this will be the future of OS's capable with touchscreen technology and Microsoft will make more touchscreen OS's (Just a guess) in the future to come. Overall, I cant wait till this order comes and will install as soon as it comes. (Future IT Graduate)"
"If you are going to record your phone calls and get caller id I recommend this modem.
I would also recommend Phonetray free and and a commercial software TRx Phone Recorder which

Great product
Nice light mousse.  Gives some control to old gray wild hair.
"This looks like it would be a good product, with a useful suite of features. But the version Amazon sent me didn't include a registration code, so I couldn't install it on my computer. I tore the box apart looking for it, scrutinizing each scrap, but it just wasn't there. Very frustrating."
"Great to purchase the card without having to ""shop""."
"i've only been using it for 2 or 3 days, but it's been good so far !"
"pretty good tool. Need it every year for my two small businesses,

Even I plan to use a CPA next year, I discuss with the CPA and plan to prepare tax by myself and let the CPA review. That still save a lot."
Anther great buy.
"This magazine has excellent fashion photography.  Mostly this is in the form of advertisements, which take up the first 175 pages and many more throughout.  The pages are almost twice the size of a standard magazine, which leaves room for more artistic ads.  The articles, I find hard to relate to or take seriously.  To me, they seem more like tabloid tales of sordid love affairs and over-hyped parties than any kind of actual informative articles.  For a magazine that is touted as a fashion industry standard, I expected to see many more articles about fashion, styles, and designers rather than Hollywood gossip.  The photographs and fashion advertisements really are great, and I believe they would be the most useful aspect of this magazine for people interested in fashion."
"I only had 1 joint return to do, so Turbo Tax did what I needed it to do. I'm glad that early purchasers of this product spoke up (loudly) about the issue of paying to print out copies and to do more than 1 return. Luckily, the company listened to the outraged customers and fixed it. A rare occurrence in this day and age. As I mentioned, I only needed to do 1 Federal return so all was well for me. The product seems to get better and easier to use each year. I am able to e-file and do my state return (Indiana) for free through the state of Indiana's Government website so all I needed was this program with the free Federal e-file. Check with you own state to see if your state offers something like that before purchasing this program"
"I'm never really sure if I actually need anti-virus protection on a Mac since many people say you don't. However my belief is not that the Mac is bullet proof when it comes to viruses but that virus creators just don't bother to try because there are more PCs and that PC viruses are easier to create. That being said when I was offered the chance to obtain a copy of Norton Anti-virus for free via the Amazon vine program I jumped at the chance to do so.

My one concern is that Norton would slow down my Mac. Norton does not seem to do this on the PCs I use but MacAfee does. Anyway my concern was unfounded as there is no perceivable difference in performance now that NAV is running.

Installation (I got the CD) was painless and I feel that if a Mac virus does come along I'm protected as well as I can be since I've taken all the steps that I know how to. Additionally I try to be smart about email attachments, fake websites, phishing schemes, etc.

So I'm not totally convince a person needs this but if the price is right it may make you feel more secure and give you some peace of mind."
"I love this language tool - the best self-study on the market! Easy to use, easy to stay motivated. Great for the home and the car (and the gym!) I have not used it for too long, but I am committed to stay with it. Tres bien :)"
"Firstly, I am a complete Poser newbie.  I have always wanted to use the program but have just not had the time/opportunity to undertake learning the software...or so I thought.

For the newbies out there, I was up and running with a character in about 10 minutes, with the caveat that I completed the two things in the paragraph below first!

The package contains PC and Mac DVD-ROMs. I have a blazing fast PC with 18GB of RAM, striped drives, and an Intel 990x processor.  So, installation was fairly quick and painless. I took the opportunity to read the included quick reference card while the software was loading so that I could have a basic familiarity with the software interface.  Also, I did a little picking/choosing of some tutorial videos at Lynda.com that covered an older version to have a basic understanding of what exactly Poser is and does before the software arrived.

The background work was quite beneficial and as stated I was up and running with a basic character in about 10 minutes. Poser is a program in which you create, pose, and animate 3D characters with pre-built libraries of characters, props, clothing, hair, ad-infinitum. You also have control of lighting and cameras as one would expect with anything 3D. Then you pose them as you wish or animate them to use in various other software programs to create art of all sorts.  I found the interface to be fairly intuitive and is like so many other tabbed interfaces in software I currently use. You start with a fairly featureless character in the main window then start adding features, lighting, body type, etc. One can then start to pose the character. Of course this is the 10,000 foot view as there are many controls to fine tune everything and are out of the scope of a review.

There are many sites that sell characters, props, clothing, hair, and the like to help you create just about anything having to do with a character! This is quite helpful, especially for those under time constraints or that may not be savvy enough to create their own in other content creation programs such as a 3D program or Photoshop.  I see this as no different than using stock photos/illustrations/characters in the art one creates, so it didn't bother me.

I have not animated a character yet, but that is on the agenda for the near future.  Having never used the program before I cannot speak to whether it is a worthwhile upgrade from an earlier version, but many professional reviewers think so. I think the price is reasonable. SmihMicro has three levels of this program: Poser Debut, that while being less powerful and feature packed is quite a bit less money and may serve as an entry level into the Poser family; Poser 9 which I am using/reviewing here; and Poser Pro 2012 which has all of the features of Poser 9 and many more pro-level features.

I think because I was able to be up and running so quickly, though at a basic level, that Poser 9 is a great asset to any artist or hobbyist wanting to add 3D characters to the art they create but have nothing to create said characters with. If you are a 3D neophyte that has wanted to try Poser but have been holding back on getting it because you thought it would be overwhelming or you felt you just plain didn't have time to learn it...I say go for it!"
"I'm currently running Windows 7 Ultimate on my laptop (and loving it -- see my other reviews for Windows 7 Home Premium or Professional editions), but I want to point out that unless you want to use BitLocker hard drive encryption, or you want to work in multiple languages, there really isn't any reason to buy Windows 7 Ultimate -- instead, Windows 7 Professional is all you need.

With Windows Vista, Microsoft separated functions between Home Premium and Business so that you had to buy the Ultimate version to get all the media-centric capability of Home Premium, and key business-centric functions like Remote Desktop server and Offline Files & Folders of the Business edition of Vista.

With Windows 7, all that has changed now.  Windows 7 Professional has *all* the media-centric capability of Windows 7 Home Premium, PLUS the business functions.  The ONLY two things you get with Windows 7 Ultimate is the ability to encrypt your hard drive and work in multiple languages.  If you're not doing either of those things presently, and if you have no intention of doing either of those things in the future, then save a little money and buy Windows 7 Professional to get everything the Home Premium has plus all the business functions you're probably used to.

That said, you may still choose Windows 7 Ultimate if you want to do an in-place upgrade (where you keep all your installed programs and settings, rather than reinstall everything).  You can't upgrade from Vista Ultimate to Windows 7 Professional with an in-place upgrade (I tried; it didn't let me).  So if you've already got Vista Ultimate, and you want to do an in-place upgrade to Windows 7, then you'll still want to buy the Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade for a smooth transition.

Looking to do a clean install using this upgrade disk? You can, but here's how. Insert the DVD and choose ""Custom"" to do the clean install. During the install, DO NOT enter your product id or activate Windows -- yet. Instead, you'll finish the clean install, reboot, then use your DVD to do an upgrade of the clean install of Windows 7. Yes, you're upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 7. After you upgrade, then enter your product id and activate Windows. I haven't tried this out personally, but others have and have done so successfully. Add a comment to my review to share your experience if you go this route. Final note: This tip isn't intended to circumvent the stipulations in the licensing agreement for upgrading your computer. If you're not entitled to upgrade (because, say, you're using Windows 95, 98, 2000, or ME), then you must buy the full version. As I tell my kids, ""Just because you can do a thing doesn't mean you should do a thing."" :-)"
A perfect gift in a beautiful box. It's ready to give!
I love guideposts. It is so uplifting to me
"I had to come back and drop a quick review on my Turbo Tax experience. I read the reviews of all of those who were saying that they were having major headaches trying to get it to download properly, and install. Then I read the reviews from those who were saying it downloaded and installed without so much as a whimper; it all went smoothly, and only took a few minutes. I noticed that those who reported a no problem install were saying they were installing it into a Vista 64 machine.

I thought the detractors must have been missing a keystroke somewhere, and after all, by downloading I was getting the latest version. The CD that you buy had to be older, and you would need a download anyhow, so why not just download it in the first place? The price was close to the same, by the time you factored in the shipping from the third party vendor. So I bought it and downloaded it into my XP machine. That is when the trouble began. It had problems every step of the way. So I decided to uninstall it and try shutting off my McAfee antivirus, as well as my Scotty the Watchdog Win Patrol that alerts me, with options every time someone tries to install a program on my machine at boot up, eating up valuable resources. Sure enough on the first install, up came the warning, and I said ""Yes"" but it stopped installing anyhow, so I shut it off, rebooted the machine, and on the third attempt, even renames the prior download, so I could download a fresh copy. (I did get a file error message somewhere along the way, so I decided to get a fresh download from the Amazon library) Well after all of that, it still didn't work. Oh it finally worked, and the program came up, after waiting about 3 minutes for it to load, and then when it did load, and I clicked on start a new return, after about 5 minutes, I decided it was frozen, and I did get a few ""Not responding"" messages when I tried to egg it on.

So I went to my other XP machine with a 2.4Mghz CPU instead of the 2.0 machine I initially installed it in, (both had 2 Gigs of ram) and this time I couldn't get it to load. Amazon is very helpful in getting the download part to work, even on a busy Sunday, 2 weeks before the deadline, but getting the Turbo Tax program to work, well that was something else altogether.

So finally I decided to give it a try in my Vista 64 Media Center PC. I downloaded it and in the middle of the download I realized it was being downloaded and installed right in the middle of recording the TV show 60 Minutes. I also had my McAfee Antivirus software running. I decided not to interrupt it. I just let it run. It fully downloaded, and all the usual prompts came up, just like before, just a lot, lot faster this time, and when it was all done, it went online, did the updates, and when I finally clicked on the ""Start a New Return"" button, it instantly flicked over to the next screen. How about that, it worked perfectly. Then I copied last year's return over the Vista PC and it drank that up, and gave me the next screen etc. No matter what I clicked on it worked perfectly. The program was running like a banshee.

So, can we conclude that it works effortlessly on a Vista machine, but it has problems with XP (Wouldn't that be a switch to all those Vista haters out there:)? Or is something in the way I ran it causes me to have 2 failures trying to load it in an XP machine, but not with the Vista?
I had to come back and edit this because with some thought I realized that I had Win Patrol with Scotty the watchdog running on both XP machines, but not on the Vista machine. What Scotty does is stop programs from loading on startup without your approval. So it pauses the load, asks is it ok, then after clicking on Ok it did not resume. So the pause turned into a halt. So if you are running Win Patrol, right click on it on the task bar and choose ""Exit"" before loading Amazon's installer installation. I did manage to work around that, and was able to access the program, but it was running like it had a corrupt file in it. Fortunately Amazon allows you to download and reinstall.

I think people who have XP can chime in here with their comments, and maybe we can get ahead of this thing. You know, fellow Amazonians, helping each other out. So if anyone has gotten good results with XP, let it be known here."
"There are other programs out there with superior capability to this product.  My recommendation: it's not worth the money, go with Adobe."
Great product
"I upgraded 2/desktop and a laptop at only $40 a piece and free Japanese language. I had to pay $190 for to use Japanese on Windows 7., Media Player does not include in W8 but there is free download during upgrade period of $40.
Uninstall third party security software before W8 installation, also should have 4GB USB Flash drive if you are downloading OS(easier to use Flash Drive) .
I have all W7 program start icons on Windows 8 Start screen and able to open just one click, even I have ""My Computer"" ,""Control Panel"" "" My Document"" icons.
Also I have icons for website which I use all the time like Google News, bank website, credit card payment site etc., I can display all most any Icon I want on Windos8 Start screen
I have installed Chrome and Firefox browser too., I have not installed third party security software.
Booting is very fast and very easy to turn off desktop by just pressing start button on PC case and using keyboard sleep button to make it sleep mode.
Very easy and fast to start after power failure.
I have to do couple step to turn off my laptop, just go sleep mode if press start button.
IE11 browser is include in W8 but I do not care much because unable to go back previous site by clicking back arrow in some case, for instance-Open Google news site then open other news site like LA times, unable to go buck Google News site by clicking arrow on the left side of screen, I have to go to W8 start screen and click Google news icon again or right-click and look for previous site on top side of screen(there are 8 previous sites information).
My desktop is very stable after installed windows 8 which I built myself 3 years ago and was unstable recently on windows 7.
Getting much better OS after Microsoft updated about 3 times after I installed first day of sale.
There is keyboard short cut information free apps from apps store and this is very useful.
There many enjoyable and usefulness free apps from apps store.
File search is much easier than  W7."
"I have been a PowerDVD user for more than a decade. In the past I liked the interface, it was easy to navigate and was my first choice for an on-board DVD player for all of my PC's.  Cyberlink's PowerDVD 16 has a lot of nice features. I was able to access nearly all of the content I have on my PC - including some B roll footage shot on a Canon HFX Digtal video camera.  I was pleasantly surprised with ithis.

You can directly watch DVD's on your hard drive, access YouTube and even download.  What I did not like about this player is that it was not able to access all of my media files in the way that my other media player of choice, Media Monkey Gold is able to do.  I have to toggle between the two and that's fine.  I have yet to find a program that ""can do it all"" - but I keep hoping."
I like this shampoo. It makes my hair feel nice and soft. I'm in my 50's and on medication. So my hair always feels dry. But when i use this shampoo it makes my hair so much softer.
"Loved the print edition and love it on my Fire even more! Color is vibrant, easy to read, just overall a great purchase Thank you Amazon for offering this magazine."
"What is the difference between VideoStudio Ultimate X8 versus Pro X8 (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-VideoStudio-Pro-X8/dp/B00T0I6J9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel VideoStudio Pro X8</a>)?  Other than that Ultimate X8 is currently only $5 more than Pro X8?  According to Corel's feature comparison, the only difference is that Ultimate X8 includes the Premium Special Effects Pack. There are 10 features in this Ultimate pack, only 2 of which are new and 8 were included in VideoStudio X7 Ultimate. The two new special effects pack are: 1) proDAD Adorage Starter Pack - Create high-quality trailers, credits and more with 150+ effects and transitions; and 2) NewBlue FX Essentials IV - Solve everyday production problems with dozens of image-enhancing presets. Turn day into night, create reflections, touch up skin and more. The other 8 are Boris Graffiti 6 (titles and effects), NewBlue FX Motion Effects, NewBlue Background Generator, NewBlue ColorFast, proDAD Mercalli SE (for image correction and stabilization), proDAD VitaScene LE, proDAD Handscript animation, and proDAD RotoPen (animated pen effects).

What's new in VideoStudio X8 (both Ultimate and Pro)? Corel lists 13 new features such as XAVC S support for resolutions up to 4K, easy freeze frames, conversion of titles to alpha channel files, more overlay capabilities, a library of ScoreFitter royalty-free music, and more. There are also five enhanced features such as enhanced motion tracking, enhanced screen capture with audio, and enhanced 4k hardware acceleration for 5th generation Intel processors, plus support for MKV files and export support for MOV (H.264 format) videos.

The X8 interface looks like the VideoStudio versions back to X4 (maybe earlier) and is also similar to other video editors. VideoStudio has three main tabs at the top: Capture, Edit, and Share.  Capture is for importing or capturing video files to work with.  Share lets you save your video files to your computer, the web, DVDs, or devices such as phones and tablets. (There is also an option to create a 3D video.) The program starts up on the Edit tab. The top left section of the Edit tab is the preview panel that displays your video; the top right section is the library of files, filters, transitions, etc; and the bottom is the timeline and tracks where perform your edits (there are 2 views: storyboard and timeline).

In my opinion the open/import features are not user-friendly. There is a File menu but no File | Open command to open a single video file. But if you keep looking you'll find the Insert Media File command. Using the Capture tab, when you double click on a folder it opens a folder tree for you to select the folder(s) of interest.  Then you click Start and then VideoStudio should show you icons of the video files in those folders.  You can then select the ones you wish to import into your VideoStudio library. The first time I saw this I couldn't figure out how to select a file to import. I finally found out there is a tiny gray box in the top left corner of each file icon that you have to click to select. I again had trouble with VideoStudio refusing to show me the files in the My Videos folder. When I selected that folder VideoStudio gives me an error message, ""There is no valid content"" even there are more than 600 videos in that folder. So I selected my Roxio folder and again got the ""no valid content"" error even though there are only about 20 avi, mpg, mp4, and wmv videos there. Then I selected 2 subfolders under My Videos and clicked Start, I got an error message that ""VideoStudio has stopped working.""  Oh well. I contacted Support about a fix and they said to just use the Insert Media command. You can also drag a video file from your file manager and drop it onto the first track (the video track) on the Edit tab. However I was not able to drag and drop my avi files there. Bummer.

The learning curve can be steep. The best place to start is probably the Quick Start guide. You can access it from the Help menu at the top left corner of the window. There are also some video tutorials on the Corel website that you can get to by clicking Video Tutorials on the Help menu.  Unfortunately the organization of the tutorials is bad and most of the tutorials won't help a beginner get started.  I think Corel wants you to purchase some of their training products.  If you get frustrated you can go to Youtube and search for Videostudio x8 tutorial, but there are about 1,500 results.  Another option is to read the 300 page user guide.

As a test I imported a 2 hour High Definition video that is 1920x1080 resolution and 2.3 GB in size.  I did a few edits and then exported it. VideoStudio was able to do that without a problem. I found it easy to do effects like freeze frame, slow motion, and time lapse.

VideoStudio X8 is a very powerful program.  The trick is learning how to use that power and getting past the few bugs."
I love the Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional. I think it manages all the things I have to do and it does it perfectally well. If you have a Pentium 4 and have this OS it is really a good combination. If you have a Pentium through Pentium III you really might want to think about XP because it does make it run a little bit faster. I love the applications this version has. I can just scroll through all the screens and everything is right there! If you buy 2000 Professional Edition you should get the Microsoft Office 2000 Professional Edition also. Microsoft is a very nice company and I think Bill Gates is the man. Microsoft just went wrong with the XP but that is the only Microsoft OS I dislike. I might be trying to convert to Apple but I am still going to keep Microsoft computers. If you were born and raised on Microsoft it isn't too hard to run it! People keep on saying Mac OS (earlier than X) was easier to operate than 95-2000 versions but for real life most people in the U.S. and other countries have Microsoft. I like both companies and if Microsoft makes another good OS after XP I will stick with them from then on.
It was a good gift with a fun card to send it in. I enjoyed sending it to a special child in our family.

"When it has came up to us, we do have a lot of music and media that we do need to start uploading for digital storage. Especially today, with nearly all of our music coming to our tablets, smartphones from places like ITunes and Google. But for those of us whom have CD's and records that do want to transition them to digital MP3 files, they need a strong burner software, that will help you rip, burn & preserve your favorite music into one place. But finding that kind of software is much easier said than done. Most of us pick the wrong software at the end. When I had heard about this free software called FreeRip, I wanted to see if was as good as other brands, and honestly it isn't as strong. FreeRip MP3 Converter is alright, but doesn't do as strong enough of a job as is the case with media software from companies like Roxio and Adobe. Not only that, but as I was ripping some CD's, it wouldn't recognize the discs as strongly as I thought it would. Overall, I would not recommend this software as strongly as others. You really can find better for the money. It is too bad it isn't here.

"Made in the USA, Vipre AntiVirus takes protecting your computer to a whole new level!  With VIPRE requiring minimal system resources (unlike: Trend Micro, Norton, Webroot, McAfee, and Kaspersky) which allows your valuable system resources to run your computer's programs faster!

  With unlimited home licensing, choosing VIPRE was a no brainer for me since I have over 5 computers in my house which need virus protection.

  In addition to unlimited home licensing, VIPRE carried their product one more step in allowing you to install their product on a netbook without the need of buying an external DVD reader (most net books do not have an internal CD/DVD drive, such as my MSI Wind).

Installing VIPRE on a NETBOOK:

  All you have to do is put your VIPRE installation disc into your computer's drive and copy the disc's content onto an empty thumb/flash drive. Once the files are successfully copied insert the flash drive into your net books usb drive and follow the onscreen installation instructions! It's that easy!

Secure File Eraser:

  The secure file eraser allows you to delete sensitive documents and files, without having to worry about someone scanning your computers deleted files and recovering your once thought deleted files! Yikes!

  I'm going to be selling a computer on EBAY in a few days and I'm anxious to try this new feature out! (P.S. Before selling any computer, it's always a good idea to reformat then run a secure file eraser like VIPRE.)

RECAP: If you're looking for new ANTI virus software, give VIPRE a look, it won't dissapoint...."

"Tree Hut has so far not sold me a product I do not love. The Kiwi body wash is mild and fragrant and cleanses well. You don't need much to clean your entire surface, so it's worth the extra price of buying from this company. Very high-quality and I will continue to buy from Tree Hut."
"Other than the start button, It runs better than Windows 7, and Windows 7 ran real good.
I got the start button added back in thru a computer utility ""Advanced system care 6"" free edition. I use the start button only because of habit and I do find it a bit faster than the tiles in 8's start screen.  I am sure at some point I will outgrow it.

I did the upgrade option this time (from 7) and not a clean install as I usually have done.  I was surprised that it went very smooth and lost no data.  I did back up everything prior to the install. Only one program had to be reinstalled because of functioning. Saved a ton of time on reinstalling everything. The upgrade will even leave your desktop as you have it in 7.
Microsoft just keeps getting better at Windows upgrade process. This one is down to a science..

Windows 8 also cleaned up a problem I was having with IE 10 on 7 which MS upgraded and then updated. Flash player was not working after the update and print was scrambled on some parts of printed matter. I found the same problem on fire fox.

Boot time seems faster with Windows 8.

If you are hooked on the start button and refuse to upgrade because of this, Upgrade to 8 and install  the utility I mentioned (free edition) and have your ""start button"" and Windows 8 your way!

Windows 8 is a great upgrade and on the surface it is much the same as Windows 7 once you get the ""start"" button back in."
"Ours arrived oddly shaped with a long line dividing the top surface, like a crater.  It must have been stored somewhere with enough heat to let it be disfigured like that without breaking, cracking, or flaking bits off.

Scent is just OK, and while we don't like ""loud"" fragrances, and appreciate subtle scents for things like soaps and body washes, this was just TOO subtle.  But then again, that could've been a side effect from however it was stored for a while that left it disfigured...

So for us, there was nothing special here.  It soaped fine, lathered fine, didn't dry out skin, but so to many, many other products out there that cost considerably less than this per bar."
It is a gift card - the tag it self is ok
"You cannot beat Norton products for security and ease of use. I've been using them for over 10 years and they have just gotten better. It includes a Password Manager (Identity Safe) which stores your passwords for each website you desire it to. Also, it has a password generator for those who have a difficult time dreaming up a new password. Word to the wise: Whether the key can be used for 1-device or 10-devices, the clock starts for all the licenses once you use the first one."
"I've been a subscriber for about five years now.  A couple of times, I've considered not renewing.  Then I'll get an issue that seems to make the entire year's subscription worth it.  Stuff like washing machines, new cars, computer monitors, even sunscreen.  At a minimum, these truly independent reviews (the organization is non-profit and the magazine is ad-free) focus you on the pivotal issues regarding each product and provide questions to ask in making your purchase.  At its best, it pretty much does your screening for you and all that's left for you to do is choose between 2 or 3 brands.  I also have to admit I get a good chuckle out of the last page, where consumers have submitted ads or product descriptions that are either misleading or just erroneous.  Every issue is not necessarily useful.  I think it's ridiculous for them to review things like cereal or restaurants, which I feel are personal preferences, or detergents, which are pretty similar nowadays.  But think about this magazine subscription as insurance against a bad purchase or as an investment that can pay you back several times over by saving you hundreds of dollars.  Bottom line:  it's worth the money."
Bought Quicken 2007 and with the exception of a new widget I don't see any improvements made in this version.  When I compare the Quicken 2007 PC version with this I am shocked at just how bad Mac users have been treated.  The PC version of 2007 has MANY more features and is far more powerful for the same amount of money.
"CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X6 has everything that most people will need to work with photos and graphics.  Unless you are a professional graphic designer who is required to work with Adobe file formats, this may be your better choice because overall, it is easier to use than the corresponding Adobe software.  For intermediate users, such as someone who creates presentations or brochures as part of their job in an organization, this software is ideal.  It also interacts well with Microsoft programs.

For people not already familiar with this package from older versions, Corel provides extensive guides plus very helpful video tutorials.  I have the X5 version and was able to try some of the new features in X6 immediately.  Even without experience, it is possible to navigate the menus and perform basic and intermediate tasks with a photo or to create a small poster but there are plenty of functions available that you probably wouldn't consider without learning about them in the documentation first.

Still, I think the best way to learn how to use this software is just to dig in and create something.  Everything may not go right the first time but there can be some interesting surprises!  The animation and web page capabilities are especially interesting and it is easy to spend hours experimenting with them.

If you have only used basic photo-editing software before, you will really be amazed at what you can do with a simple snapshot.  The analysis and control it gives you over color may even change the way you see color and think about it.

The package contains over 2,000 fonts.  There are also well over 10,000 pieces of decent clip art, objects, and templates.  Some of the specialty templates have a limited audience but they are invaluable for those who need them.  The Corel Connect really does make it easier to find elements you want to use in your projects and it now has multiple project trays and improved internet search and grab capabilities.

Some of the other features new to X6 allow you to experiment with and adjust entire project color schemes, work more efficiently with fonts and web page designs, plus new object, vector shaping, and layout tools and effects.

CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X6 is very powerful and useful software that is fun to explore and use.  The features new to X6 are welcome improvements but X5 may be a better value for some users."
Love this magazine!  Last month Redbook had a wonderful workout and great practical recipes that I am acturally going to attempt. I learn something new in every issue which is totally what I am looking for in a publication.
Hard to use and is way too simple in content for even the average user.
Terrible food
"I have been using this for about a year now, and as a novice video maker, I found this to be indispensable. I was able to quickly learn how to use it without any trouble and I have had no trouble using it since. It is robust enough that it grows with you as you improve your video skills but easy enough to use for a first time user. Highly recommended."
"Been using McAfee for more than a decade.  I don't remember when I started.  Short side trip to Norton (memory/cpu hog) forced me back to McAfee in short order.  It has never failed to block trojans, embedded malware in programs, email delivered viral attempts, risky connections, etc.  However, I had to call CS for installation on my cells.  Didn't trust myself installing on my cells.  Good verbal guidance and written instructions were sent to me and resultant protection now resides on all my devices for one low price.  There is no better protection on the market in my opinion.  You can't go wrong with McAfee,"
I had a different antivirus sent to me a while back. Honestly their all the same. You can download AVG for free and it is just as good as the ones you pay for and I know a lot of computer places that build computers install AVG instead of making customers pay.
Good MS office alternative.
"This Norton security works fabulously. We have used Norton products for several years now and have never had any problems. It's easy to download, setup, and run. If you are looking for an affordable computer security software look no further!"
"I really did not know what I was going to get with Hassle Free packaging, but it was actually okay to not have a box to put in recycling.  The product and its activation key come in a straightforward and easy to open oversized CD poster board thickness CD jacket.  The face of the CD says Homeowner and Investor now.

I have used H&R tax software since before the company used it and it was called Tax Cut.  I have always been happy with it but I have so many years of experience I prefer not to use the interview method of form completion for everything.  Having error and consistency checks is useful..  It is also good to have some forewarning if deductions might prompt an audit, although in the end you still need to put down the correct information even if it means dealing with the IRS later to defend what is claimed.

I would go back to doing my tax returns entirely by hand and calculator before spending the much higher price that Turbo Tax demands, but the convenience of avoiding careless mistakes, especially in math, make this software worth using.  If you also need to file a non-trivial state income tax form just be sure to buy a version that includes the state tax form.  I have no need for that though.  My state has no state income tax and my previous state had just simple modifications of what is on the 1040 to make that would not have justified paying even $1 more to get the state form."
"Had Paperport 12 Pro on Win XP/sp3
Forced to move to Paperport 14 Pro when installing into Windows 8/64. Earlier versions of Paperport will not work in Win 8/64. Most off the shelf laptops and desktops will have 64 bit Windows 8 installed.

Users of PP12 will see a familiar interface in PP14 but will definitely have problems in Win 8/64 getting your scanner/printers to work. Win 8 requires printer/scanner manufacturers to rewrite their USB and LAN drivers.  Your Brother printer/scanner must have the latest firmware BEFORE installing Brother USB drivers for Windows 8. My Brother MFC-7860DW scanner/printer will handshake and scan to PP14 only over the LAN connection, but PP14 will print a hard copy over the USB or LAN connection to the Brother printer. Go figure. Brother really has problems posting the correct sequence to update their drivers to work in Win 8.

PP14 is great for organizing your scanned images whether they be done in tiff or pdf. That is why I have been using Paperport since they became the default big dog when they bought out Pagis Pro some years ago. Yes, there are other document scanning/sorting/filing programs but Paperport allowed you cut/delete and paste from one document to another. Whether it was pdf/pdf, tiff/pdf, or pdf/tiff. This is a tool I use extensively.

UNFORTUNATELY, Paperport 14 Pro has broken the RESIZE tool.  In PP12 you could resize a document or image larger or smaller.  Important if you scan a business card and want to enlarge it a bit for easier reading or shrinking something down to fit better on a size of paper.  The Resize tool is there, but no longer works, no matter if you want to increase or decrease the size in inch/cm/mm or DPI you now get a what the heck ""The requested size is too large. Please use smaller values or reduce the image DPI values.""  You have to cancel and ""be happy"" with the what you get is what you get. So that business card you have with 100 lines of mouse type is still going to be 100 lines of mouse type printed business card size on a 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper.  This ""BUG"" has been noted at Nuance help forums since early 2012, it is now September 2013.  Nuance has been consistent on their product updates and support, zippo, zero, nada. Their update notices are merely upsell notices to upgrade.

If you have Windows 7 or earlier keep your Paperport 12 or look for Paperport 12 if you do not have it. If you have Windows 8/64 you should look to alternatives.  Try FileCenter trial version first.  If you really want to try Paperport 14 Pro then download the 15 day trial/demo version of Paperport 14 Pro.

If you find something that worked in PP12 but is broken in PP14 do not expect it to be fixed at all by Nuance.

I am currently stuck with a reduced feature Paperport 14 Pro because I have Windows 8. I think I will increase my loses and quit Windows 8 which I have had for 2 weeks and buy Windows 7 for a Windows ""upgrade"".

Tech/Phone support is MON-FRI. HUH!
Online chat support with off shore reps work more days. They are OK but the language syntax may throw you once in a while.
Free Tech Phone/Web support for 90 days, after that you pay $9.95 for help. No support for trial versions.

UPDATE 008/11/2016 downrated to one star
Paperport 14 Pro has been working in Windows 7 Pro/64.
Tried PP14 in Windows 10 64bit and program does not close in Windows 10.  Must close using task manager and force close.  Will continue to use in Windows 7 but not on Windows 10 machines.  Noticed price drop so maybe a new version of Paperport is coming out that actually works in Windows 8 and Windows 10.  The cut and paste feature in PP14Pro is the only thing keeping me using this ancient software."
Great price.
clients love it
Great product.
JUST RIGHT...
One of my favorites
"I have an older version of Pinnacle Studio and it was fun to play around with. It had issues with crashing, but it was for hobby stuff, so I put up with it. We even tried our own green screen, but it was amateur at best. I was thrilled to get the latest version, and I hoped that many of the issues I had with the older version were solved. Wrong. Like the previous version, this one crashes at random. It took me a long time to make a 2-minute book promo trailer with still photos and background sound simply because it kept crashing. The good thing though was that at least when I started it up again, it had saved my work each time. It seemed to crash when I closed out of a dialogue box and it was auto saving.

I'm running Windows 8 on my computer, and I meet all the specs from the box on my system.

Anyway, here are some of the pros and cons.

PROS
-Comes with a green screen panel. Fun!
-Includes 50 G of storage space on the cloud.
-The interface is easy to figure out and use.
-Installed easily, although it takes a long time!
-Lots of effects that you can add to your photos and objects (if using still photos like a slide show)
- Has the capability of creating 3D movies. Includes disposable pair of 3D glasses. I don't have a 3D movie to test it out.
-The library layout is great, and it's easy to drag and drop a file into the movie and drag it around. Easy to add audio too.

CONS
-The crashes.
-Adding still photos that are medium quality leads to disappointing results, even if they look great in other programs.
-Transitions were a little difficult to time out the way I wanted them to.
-The crashes.
-The full installation takes a whopping 5.8 Gigs of space. I had a recent upgrade, or else I'd have had to pass on installing it.
- I'm very disappointed that this version still doesn't support taking .MOV files from my digital camera and importing them for editing. I can see the video, but the audio doesn't import without going through external software for converting it to AVI.  Since it's common for people to shoot video on a digital camera, this is a huge oversight in programming. My Quick Time says my file is a MPEG-4 file which should be compatible, and I don't think I ought to have to purchase $30 converting software to convert.
- The crashes.
- Adding text was tedious as it didn't have a ""recently used"" box on the font color formatting or the style such as shadow, etc. So I had to either copy and paste a previous slide to edit, or I had to write down the RGB color numbers I used for the font so I could recreate it on the next slide.

I really wanted to like this software. But I didn't. I did successfully create the book trailer I was trying to make, but it was a tedious process.  I would not buy this or upgrade in the future. It was slow because of the crashes, and I've given two versions of Pinnacle a go with the same issues. I'll be trying Adobe Premier Elements next to see if that's better."
"I was only disappointed with the subscription department.  I'm sure it wasn't Amazon's fault, but we just can't seem to get this straightened out.  I tried to get this magazine as a renewal for someone as a gift, but they keep sending it to me and I've written to Amazon at least twice to correct it.  Otherwise, I love the magazine."
"There are many competitors in the very crowded market for video editing software.  This one has a good feature set and is pretty easy to do the basics with, but learning the more advanced features is time consuming.

If you have used previous versions of competing products, I wouldn't switch at upgrade time because of the extra learning curve.  If, however, this is you first purchase of this class of software, this product will do the job for you if you have patience to learn it."
"This software has a nice interface and plenty of features for the home/consumer video enthusiast. There's also a great user support forum linked to the publisher's website.

Unfortunately, I found the program to be somewhat buggy and cannot recommend it. The most significant issue was that my PC's DVD drive wasn't recognized by the program when it was time to burn a disk. There were numerous, time consuming workarounds and fixes mentioned on the Video Studio forum. One user even solved his issue with the software by reinstalling his PC's operating system. But who wants to go through all that?

I downloaded the trial versions of Sony's Vegas Pro and DVD Architect Pro, as a previous reviewer suggested, and they worked just fine on the same PC. Those programs are definitely worth the extra money if you value your time."
Amazon cards are always awesome to give or receive.  The tin is nice and makes it a nice touch when you give it to someone.  The free tin saves you a few bucks to make a better presentation.
"This is a fairly inexpensive way to get the use of Photoshop and Lightroom, but you need to understand that you will not own the program. This is essentially a one-year subscription to these programs, and you will need to resubscribe if you want to continue using the programs after the year ends.

There are pros and cons to using the software this way versus purchasing the incredibly expensive software. People have different opinions on this, but if you're like me you can't afford the full versions of the software, and with the subscription system you won't cringe when the newer versions come out.

That being said, Photoshop and Lightroom are outstanding programs. Photoshop is the industry standard and will allow you to manipulate images in just about any way you can imagine. Lightroom is more of an organizer type of software that enables you to do editing and sharing.

One of the nicer features about this version is that you can use your mobile device, and it will sync with your desktop. You also will be sure that you have the most recent versions of Photoshop and Lightroom.

This is an ideal option if you need Photoshop and Lightroom and don't have lots of money."
"I love this mag.  I just hope it gets delivered,I think some one is taking it..."
"I have a good friend I may give this to, or maybe send it to my little sister for Christmas, she has everything and is hard to shop for, maybe this and a pre paid visa card would be a great gift?"
"First, I really love Oprah.  I find her inspirational, fun, and thought provoking.  This magazine is a reflection of all of that.  I love getting it in the mail.  The articles are intelligent and interest me as a woman, entrepreneur, and mother."
"GUEST REVIEWER  ! MRS KNOW IT ALL ;b

This is a nice software bundle for a person just starting out working with photos, videos, and music files.  It is so easy to put together slide shows with music, photo albums with music, create a movie with music/sound and to just create cards, invitations, etc.  Once you have mastered this software, I then jump over to other well know products, such as Corel.  With Corel, you will have some many options for all types of products and great movie editing.  Therefore, for the price, I would start with this product and then move onto the others when I am more proficient."
excellent products and excellent seller
"So far I have had good success with Kaspersky Pure. Unlike other AV products, if there is a major mid-term release or upgrade Kaspersky upgrades for free until the time of license expiry. I only wish if they could sell the 'Key' alone minus all the CD / Package etc and pass on the savings to customers."
"I've used Acronis backup for a number of years.  Although they keep adding functions, I only use the ""image"" backup mode.  That is, image my ""C"" drive and store it somewhere.  For many years, I would store the image on a second hard drive within the computer.  Now that I have gone totally ""laptop"", I store the image on an external hard drive connected to the laptop via USB.  Your ""C"" drive WILL fail, you just don't know when.  I would guess they last about 3 years.  Even if you have all of the disks for your operating system and other programs, restoring from these is painful.  With Acronis, you just pop in a CD to boot the system and then restore from somewhere.  I have had to use Acronis to restore my computer(s) at least a half dozen times over the years. It's a ""white knuckle"" experience waiting to see it your ""C"" drive is restored, but it does work.  Acronis likes to update their s/w about every year (obviously, to generate revenue).  I'm okay with that, basically, because I have to pay yearly ""subscription"" updates to things like virus checkers.  But, too many times Acronis has introduced bugs that take some time to resolve.  They DO offer updates to current users at a discounted price and I have been taking advantage of these updates so that I don't get too far behind.  Sometimes they ""re-format"" the data files so that you HAVE to keep up.  My latest experience is as follows:  I had been ""updating"" Acronis for several years and was using the 2011 version being rated.  Works fine.  Then, I was offered a 2012 update so I bought it.  But, the update would not install.  Rather than screw around with something I really didn't need, I thought I'd just wait until they fixed it.  But, several weeks later, one Friday when I tried to do my weekly ""C"" image, Acronis 2011 wouldn't run.  It said that the ""demo"" trial period had expired and I needed to ""buy"" the full version.  I don't know why this happened but something like this has happened in previous years.  So, I thought I'd simply try to get the 2012 version I had to load.  But, it wouldn't install because it thought that the 2011 version wasn't qualified since it was now labled ""demo"".  So, I was faced with trying to install several previous versions and their upgrades to get back to where I was.  This just seemed like too much work and risk so I bought this ""old"" 2011 version and installed.  It installed okay and I'm I back in business.  I will try the 2012 update someday when I have nothing else to do and AFTER I do a Windows Backup and probably when I've been drinking.  Having been violently angry at Acronis for such foolishness several times, I have searched for a replacement but have not found one that completely images or is cheap enough.  There ARE other backup programs that image, but I haven't found one, except for Acronis, that lets you ""mount"" the backup image, view it, and actually run stuff from it.  After every backup, I mount the image and look for something on my desktop that is recent, like a Word document, or a PDF.  Then, I open it.  This procedure gives me confidence that the image is intact and recent.  I don't image or save files to a cloud or server, like Carbonite, which I did use for several years, because they are just too slow, don't image, and, importantly to me, could be compromised - by server failure, by a hacker, by bankrupcy, or by the government (megadownload?).  Image saving is only part of my backup strategy which includes backing up selected files to a networked RAID drive, a second networked computer, a thumb drive, and a CD.  I have all of this pretty well automated through use of other programs.  Years ago, it was more likely that Windows would hammer your ""C"" drive rather than drive failure itself.  To give Microsoft some credit, this now happens rarely (at least for me) with their latest operating systems.  But still, the most important backup thing I have ever done is to image my ""C"" drive, and I do that once a week.  It takes about 3 hours, but you can start it when you go to bed and check the box that says to turn off the computer when it's done.  As far as Acronis's other features, I can't say. I've never used them, don't need them, and wouldn't trust them.  But, it does work for drive imaging."
as described would purchase again
Always easy to use and accurate.
nice christmas theme on the box.
Wonderful magazine!!  I have had a subscription to Family Circle for over 30 years and I continue on receiving it because I enjoy it and I love all the information I get out of each magazine!!  Thank you to Family Circle!!
"I am a big fan of Turbotax, and have been for many years.  I find their products very ""intuitive"" to use, and the question-and-response method of entering tax data is very useful to me.  What's more, I like the fact that they offer different versions of the software for different tax situations.  I have used many versions, but this year again, the Premier edition is perfect for my situation, with some stock action to report, as well as rental income.  (P.S.  Their small business and self-employed version is great, too, and helped my self-employed wife for many years accurately report income, in order to get social security credit, and properly file.)

Lots of people complain about TurboTax each year, but I think you will see, the overwhelming amount of reviews are positive.

For over 10 years now, TurboTax has helped us quickly, accurately, and easily file our taxes.  Simply go through each section (income, deductions, credits, etc.), answering each question as it pertains to you.  Voila!  Any credits you are due are credited, any deductions, too.  It will tell you if you're better off taking the standard deduction, or itemizing.

Filing is a piece of cake.  It lets you electronically transmit your data to the IRS, and saves a .pdf file of your return for you, every single form needed.  Refunds are processed quickly, within a week to 10 days has been my experience.

I highly recommend this product if you have investment income/losses to report, as well as rental property.  If not, simply go to their website, or look on amazon, and find the version that is right for you.  They offer 4 different versions to cover individual situations."
"The DVD reader on my primary computer is broken so I downloaded the files from the Corel site.

 The total install is about 3.8GB and though the downloading was pretty quick, the very slow install process failed the first time, throwing up a message that I should call Corel Technical Support. No error codes, no explanation, no nothing that an experienced user would use for troubleshooting before getting involved with a probable wait for telephone support.

 So I relied on instinct and tried to install a second time, which also took a very long time, but it installed without issue.

 On an i7 based computer with an Nvida GPU, 16GB RAM and a 7200RPM drive, launching Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X9 invokes a static splash screen that cannot be minimized or sent to another layer. The VideoStudio splash screen takes over you machine, keeping you from doing anything else, for more than 3 minutes! Absolutely unbelievable. After taking my  enforced nap, I checked in Preferences to see if the splash screen for an option to not have it launch. Nope.

 The next time, I wil have a stop watch handy when I launch VideoStudio, but I think the three minutes plus is reasonably  accurate.

 Unreal.

 I checked Windows 10 Task Manager and my system is relatively clean, no impediments to Corel executing quickly.

 But everything about this program seems to be slow. Dragging clips from the media bin to a track is slow. There is a noticeable delay between clicking the lay  start button and the video playing. Transitions take time. Everything takes time, way too much time.

 I run Adobe Premier Pro, Adobe Premier Elements, Cyberlink PowerDirector, TrakAxPC, Magix Movie Edit Pro 2016 and other video programs on this computer and none run as slow as Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X9.

 As a result of this sluggish performance, I have to give up testing it for today  I just don't have that much time. I will come back to it later when I can endure the long waits. I will say that the program was stable during all this: no crashes, just incredibly slow performance. And the idea of a static splash screen that you cant dismiss is pathetically archaic.

 More later  when I have the time and patience. If I can get the program faster, my rating will almost certainly increase.

Jerry"
The perfect card for a family.  With limited choices of restraints in there area. Plus they enjoy eating at IHOP Thanks for offering on Amazon it was delivered in less then 24 hoursi
I was running Nero 8 and installed a Blu-Ray player.  When I inserted a Blu-Ray Disc Nero started and told me I had to have Nero 9.  I bought the program and then found out it does not support any Blu-Ray.  Tech support was very rude and would not give me a refund.  Also it was extremly bloated and HD intensive.  Stay wither Nero 7 or 8 or another program all together.
"Every time I get a new Quicken program, it is worse than before. Literally. I would go back to the 1990's versions if I could!
I honestly don't understand what those Quicken programmers are up to. I think they just need to tinker with it constantly to justify getting more money for forced upgrades. But they are really downgrades.
There are many features I miss from 15 years ago!
I was forced to ""up"" grade to this version so I could get downloaded quotes and transactions from my broker. That is the ONLY reason I bought this. Intuit is a rip off company. Why no one competes with them is beyond me. They could get a heck of a lot of customers switching from Intuit. Maybe Intuit bumps them off before they can develop anything.

Quicken 2012 ""downgrades"":
1. The ""find"" function in the register no longer automatically chooses the field that the cursor is in, but does ""all fields"" as the default, creating the need for more mouse clicks than before.

2. No longer can do a simple report based on the vendor in the field the cursor is in but have to go to a long menu instead, again necessitating more mouse clicks than before.

3. Got rid of the choice to automatically edit the split of a transaction to the same percentage as the last transaction of that vendor. So now you have to use a calculator to figure it out yourself. More time wasted.

4. Tax report to Turbo Tax closes Quicken

5. Much slower quote downloads. MUCH SLOWER.

Also, there is no W2 report. So why bother letting us track W2's with all the various deductions, taxes, etc? This has never existed that I know of.

I wish Intuit would read this: get a real job! Quit making Quicken worse every year. Stop your monopolizing practices. You used to be a good company when you were small in your basement when you first started. Now you are just greedy jerks."
I use Dragon Naturally Speaking on my Window desktop so I decided to give the new version of Dictate a try. It installs and runs in the background like a service.  Make sure you update to  Dragon 5 for Mac version 5.0.4 released in December.  In Word is does a decent job of dictation which is my primary use but it still produces extra spaces and seems to forget the mic now and then.
"I am looking to replace quickbooks pro.  I would really love to replace quickbooks pro. I wish their was something available that would. I was hoping this new Sage 50 Complete was a viable replacement. However it seems that Peachtree has been bought out and Sage has turned the product in to some sort of subscription based accounting software.

You will be spending much more money than the initial $200 to get started fee. At least $250 or more annually. If they had taken a similar approach to the ink jet printer market they would have offered the program for $50 and then made you shell out more to continue. However the up front cost plus the high subscription fees make this a ridiculous purchase. I will not be continuing down this path. If you have peachtree, don't upgrade unless you have to and are prepared too. If you are on quickbooks, stay on quickbooks. Make sure you know full about what you are getting in to with this Sage program. It is an accounting program that adds to their bottom line, not yours.

1 star ridiculous."
"I've used quicken since the late '80s and loved it. I really loved when they added the ability to attach documents to a transaction. Now when you attach a pdf document, you get an icon on the screen, you can't see if it's the correct attachment. Worse, when you go back to check information on your attachments, you have to open quicken, open the transaction, open attachments, then click on the attachment to open the document reader to see the attached document. If you have more than one attachment, you have to open each one separately until you find the one you're looking for.
The mobile app would be really nice, if it worked. I used it fine, with most accounts, for a couple months; then the new year turned the calendar and quicken wanted me to upgrade to something I'd already been using for months. It wouldn't sync until I did, problem is, it wasnted me to sign on with the old account, but when I tried to do that, it wouldn't. I lciked for it to send me the password, even though I know what my old password was, but it wouldn't send me the necessary ""code"", so I resent, which was my only other option. well that errased everything from my phone app. I tried contacted tech support, first via online chat. I was 32 in line and waited 45 minutes for the count down to me being next, then got a message that no one was available to try again later. So I submitted my question to the call option and they sent me a number to call. I waited 1.3 hours, and never got anything but ""we will be with you shortly"". So I guess, as bad as the new quicken is, the CS is the worst. I'll be looking for something else after more than two decades."
"Norton 360 version 2.0 is the latest iteration of Symantec's popular all in one utilities.  It came about as a bundling of the various standalone software such as Norton Antivirus, Norton Utilities, Norton Firewall and Ghost (included in some versions).  The fact that these software were developed separately and then marketed together shows up in the uneven performance across the board.

First, the good.  The Utilities component is outstanding.  The defragmentation feature is worth the price of admission and represents an upgrade over the vanilla variety that windows offers (which in of itself is licensed from symantec I believe). the registry maintenance is another heaven-sent feature.

Then there is the ugly. Some components such as the Antivirus consume an inordinate amount of system resources to cause a noticeable slowdown in system performance.  While the virus protection does work well there are free programs which work just as well, with minimal hit to your computer's speed.

360 2.0 is more user friendly than the prior versions with better integration of the various components.  It is to be recommended for the casual user.  However, expert users will be able to replicate much of its functionality using free utilities that are faster and much efficient."
"Not much to say. Have needed and used TurboTax Premier (Fed and one State) for years and find it to be consistent with past products. Waited to purchase the download version April 10, when it went on sale for fifty six bucks. Good deal."
Installed easily
Wincleaner gets rid of register problems and useless files. It cleans out cache memory. It will speed up your computer. I've used it for years. It's easy to use and doesn't crash your system.
"I got a subscription to this magazine for $5, which was a good thing because I was disappointed with this magazine.  I was recently diagnosed with diabetes, so I am always on the lookout for good recipes that I can prepare and eat without messing up my diet.  I had heard good things about the Everyday with Rachael Ray magazine, so when I found this great price I decided to try it.  I loved the general setup of the magazine, but was disappointed that the recipes didn't show any nutritional information.  How am I supposed to know if the dishes are diabetic-diet friendly, if there is no nutritional information available?  I already received a renewal bill, but I won't be renewing the magazine unless I see some improvement in the next couple of months."
"At first I thought that this product would be great for my teenagers' computers.  Then I read the fine print.

1. The ""protection"" is good for 1 year only & then you get to pay again.
2  You have to put in a credit card number when you install the software.
3. There is a Norton anti-theft icon on your desktop for any would-be thief to see.
4. Any would-be thief that knows a little about computers can override this Norton software and/or wipe the hard drive.

This software does not live up to my expectations.  For a laptop locator, I'd look elsewhere.

For phone tracking, I can do that for free on my Windows phone & the GPS is accurate, so this Norton software is not something I'd consider buying for my phone.  I believe that Android phones have a free tracking app too."
FAST AND EASY
"A lot of features for not a lot of price, it does have a bit of a learning curve but they provide a lot of lessons and guidance on how to use each feature. If you have any background with video editing, this offers an easy step into some useful task, though not entirely advanced compared to other programs. I'd heartily suggest it for people who aren't willing or interested to jump in to the more professional programs, or are interested but they're budget isn't--but who want to have more creative possibilities than what a basic program like Windows Movie Maker or lower end/price programs. This is also a really good stepping stool for those higher end products. Get to know basics and exploration on this, then if and when you find you come to the end of what it offers, move on. The expensive programs really are overkill for the great majority of people (and I say this as someone who has the Adobe suite and realize that even as an educator I'm paying more than what I reasonably need to use).

Great middle ground software that would fit most people's needs and spark a lot of creative development"
"In view of many of the other more detailed reviews, let me be brief. This is an excellent tool for detecting and deleting spyware. SpywareDoctor is easily installed and finds far more spyware than many other programs I have tried. I give it top marks!"
"Unlike Turbo Tax Basic this software provides everything you need to do your return correct.

I used to always use Turbo Tax Basic, but this year they stripped it down to nothing. Sorry guys, but I had to switch to Tax Cut Premium Federal. Includes everything most people need and the price is right. Highly recommended."
"Stinks!  All they want is cloud subscription.  Don't buy this if you hate more monthly or yearly  payments. User interface is really bad.  I was going to detail what is bad, but the list got so long I decided to just say forget it!  Note: After  months of using this software and two major upgrades it is still bad!  The last update  on 4/29/2016 (Win 7 Pro) caused errors on my computer -""Acronis Stopped Running....."".  I tried to uninstall and reinstall, rolled back registry all to no avail.  I finally had to restore using an earlier backup.  So backup software that is supposed to protect my computer caused me to have to do a restore.  What is going on at Acronis?"
"My daughter likes it because it's trendy and features the stars she likes, but also outfit inspiration. The clothes are a little pricey, but it never hurts to window shop."
"Love the print magazine that I have subscribed to for many years and given as gifts.  Now the ""free KINDLE "" magazine is charging me again?
I don't think it's right to be charged twice!!! and to try to get the magazine subscription manager for help is ridiculously difficult. Not worth my time but I am not going to pay for the kindle edition.  I have to cancel all my magazine subscriptions and buy them from the the publisher, Hello Amazon."
"I have use Quicken for over 15 years and I can't believe how cumbersome and poorly conceived this version is compared to past versions.  The main page is useless and you now have to open multiple windows to get the information you need, then you have to close all the windows you opened to get to the next account.  When looking at a performance page of your investment accounts you get a pie chart instead of a bar graph.  What good is a pie chart when you are looking at performance data over a specific time range.  I thought the purpose of newer versions was to improve the existing version and not regress.  If Microsoft still had a financial program I would be forced to migrate to another program.  Intuit needs to change it's company name because this program is not intuitive.  It is ill conceived and makes for a frustrating experience."
"I have been a loyal TurboTax user since 2003.  It is easy, as thorough as you need it to be for at home use, and affordable compared to professional tax return services.  I have never had a problem installing this software for 8 years now, and it has always performed reliably, preparing flawless tax returns, and ensuring quick and easy refunds.

I've used the relevant versions to report Schedule C self-employment income (the program quickly and easily calculates the self-employment tax, ensures you get social security credit for your self employment, and gives you next year's estimated tax payments) as well as investment income.  The feature to download 1099-DIV and 1099-INT statements from your investments accounts is priceless, as is its ability to calculate your short and long-term capital gains.  Schedule D is a scary form, I cannot imagine doing it myself.  Yet I breeze through it year after year with the help of TurboTax and the automatic imports from my brokerage accounts.

If you're thinking of giving this program a try, I can thoroughly recommend it.  Your life is about to become a lot easier ... enjoy your refund!!"
"Wonderful magazine. Great ideas and tips for the kitchen, children, and home. About even with the advertising and articles."
"I have used Turbo Tax for years and imagine my surprise that starting in 2014 they removed Schedules C, D, E & F and the supporting worksheets!  Raising the price of the product is one thing, but removing forms and not telling the customer until you buy the product and find out that not only can you not import last year's data, you can't even manually fill out this year's taxes!  Dirty, dirty trick!  I often wonder how companies that are at the top of the heap can fade out of existence so quickly.  Poor management decisions.  This is how it starts."
"I have been a big supporter of Kaspersky products for over seven years.

I like their Internet Suite and their Anti-Virus software. Althugh most people don't think about it, I find that tablets and smartphone require just as much protection as the computers. This package provides a good starting point fo a family with two Android smartphones, or with a smartphone and a tablet,"
Love the Better Homes and Gardens magazine. Makes me wish I owned a house with a nice garden. But reading this mag lets me dream.
"For the most people's home video editing needs, Cyberlink PowerDirector covers pretty much anything you'd ever need or want to do, and plenty you probably weren't aware you could do. The program lets you choose either the ""easy"" or ""full-featured"" editing mode when it loads, and after going through the basic features you can then switch to advanced for additional editing, so you aren't just dropped into a sea of options you won't know how to navigate.

The only problem I have with the basic editing toolset is that it appears to force you to put a theme on your video, such as slow motion or having your clip appear in a rotating mobile above a baby's crib. I couldn't seem to find a way to just add music and change the file type in the basic toolset without first adding an unnecessary theme (although these things are easily done in advanced mode). The amount of options available is pretty staggering, and much of it is automatic and doesn't require specialized knowledge on the user's part. There are auto-correction features for fixing poor lighting, shaky camera, etc. along with controls to manually adjust the color and brightness levels both across the whole video clip or just individual frames.

Before producing a finished video the software lets you change the aspect ratio and do advanced editing by adding things like particle effects or a large array of pre-made themes. For something simpler, there's also the option to create slideshows from individual frames or photos. There are of course also tools for breaking your video down into chapters like in a normal movie before burning to a DVD. Frankly there are more options than you'll likely be able to figure out on your own unless you happen to be well versed in this type of software, and thankfully there's a large book-style manual included that goes over everything.

While you probably won't be editing together ""The Return of the King"" anytime soon with Power Director, it definitely puts more power and options at your fingertips than with the usual suspects like Windows Movie Maker. Power Director does require lots of processing power however, so make sure you exceed the minimum system requirements before buying. Using this on a run of the mill laptop meant primarily for web browsing or word processing is going to result in a very slow and choppy experience, especially while editing individual frames or creating your finished video file."
"IMPORTANT: This new version of Microsoft Office switched everything to the cloud.  So your files are stored and edited on Microsoft's internet servers.  Because cloud is so new and every week we hear about major software companies (recently Adobe) getting hacked into and because of the NSA spying problems (with Google, Facebook and others giving the gov't private information), I am very cautious about which files I open with any Microsoft products.  Unfortunately this limits my use of many of the programs.  I keep my financial records, spreadsheets, email, and personal information saved on my computer only and accessed with Open Office.

OTHER OPTIONS: Open Office is the free equivalent to Microsoft Office and performs just as good in my opinion.  If you haven't yet tried Open Office and just need basic word processing, spreadsheet and slide program, it is perfect!  For email checking program, I recommend Thunderbird - Mozilla's software (the company that makes FireFox).

So why did I buy Microsoft Office then?  Because I am sharing files with others and using templates that only work on Microsoft Office software.  If I didn't have this requirement, then I would still be 100% Open Office.

If you are thinking of upgrading from an older version of Microsoft Office, know that this new version uses a rather odd menu system.  The age-old (and very good) menu system is gone.  Now we have big button, icons and more difficulty navigating.  No more drop down menus.  No blocks of icons that we can shuffle through.

All-in-all, this is just okay.

1)The software is reliable.  I've never had a crashed program - which happens about once in fifty uses with Open Office.

2) Retrieving files from the cloud greatly extends file loading times and saving times.  Shutting down the Microsoft software requires you to wait while all the files are checked for duplication correctness (a copy is saved on the cloud and on your personal computer).

3) The new menu system takes more time to learn and use.  I don't consider it faster or more intuitive.  I like older menus better.  But Windows is entering a new era of visual design, so the Microsoft Office software has been designed to match it.

3 stars because it's not great, but different.  Nothing new has been added except templates and the cloud file storage.  Because I don't like the requirement to use cloud I deduct some stars.  It limits what files I'm willing to open (no important personal information or financial records)."
"Another nice piece of software from Corel. As a Paintshop Pro X7 owner I didn't necessarily need to upgrade to X8. The benefits I received for doing so were slim. There were a few additions that I noticed but nothing that I would particularly use. Watermarking is one nice feature that they added but not something that applies to my usage.
However if you do not have photo editing software then this is a good one to get. There's not much you can't do with it, and will serve most peoples needs for organizing and editing their personal photos without having to pay out for the higher priced Photoshop. It does have quite a bit of a learning curve but what else can you expect from the multitude of features. There's plenty of places to get help or you can just tinker until you figure it out (which is usually what I do.)"
"This is a very comprehensive protection package. It comes from the second oldest name in this field. That said it's a bit unwieldy. Since installing it I have had a noticeable slow-down in my computer. I don't have that slow of a PC, Quad Core 4 GB of RAM?? Now it's crawling worse than it usually does. I also had an instance when installing that it kept giving me errors on the password I needed to create for it. It kept telling me it was invalid, but not why. It wouldn't let me create an online account. I finally guessed that it might want a password with mixed letters and numbers. That worked. I shouldn't have to guess.
After install, it scanned my computer at 4 in the morning and I was clean except for 5 cookies it didn't like. No viruses  or anything overly malicious. I was using Windows Defender and Avast! before this. They are free. Overall it's quite a deal especially if you qualify for the rebate on it, currently."
"I don't ""hate"" this product like some reviewers here. I think the software is decent, the price is not too bad, and it has a neat control panel. In other words, if you've been using Trend Micro for years, and it works for you - I'm not trying to talk you out of it.

The problem for me is, I don't know why I would ever be compelled to buy it. It's inferior to the free options out there. So if you're looking for the best protection, there is no single option that will cover all your bases. But fortunately, the best rated programs are all free.

Here's what our IT staff recommends:

* For Anti-Virus: Either AVAST or AVIRA. Both free, both fairly equivalent in protection, in speed, in program size, etc. They will give you some annoying popups asking if you want to upgrade, but the basic home version is both adequate & free.

* For Firewall: If using Windows XP, 7, or Vista, just enable the Windows Firewall. In tests, the Windows Firewall does as well as others. Never run two firewall programs, as this can cause problems. If using an older version of Windows, use Zone Alarm (also free). Also, your router acts as a secondary firewall (even if you only have one computer hooked up).

* For hijacks, redirects, popups, & malicious web sites: Use HostsMan. This tiny little program (also free) amazingly keeps a list of malicious sites and prevents them from loading on your browser.

* For emergencies: Install these programs just in case - Spybot Search & Destroy, C-Cleaner, & Malwarebytes Anti-Malware. Run C-Cleaner once a week - to keep your system running optimally, to clean up unwanted files, and clean your registry. The other two programs are to run just in case you have a problem, and it's super handy to already have them on your computer in case a virus or hijack is preventing internet access.

So I can't really recommend the Trend Micro, but I'll go ahead and share my experience with it:

-Install was a nightmare process, slows down boot time, bulky program.

-I really don't like the free online backup, because you are forced to renew every 12 months. In my opinion it's a marketing gimmick to get you to renew, when there are many options out there which are better (and free). For important files, I back up manually on Google Docs. For bookmarks, backup on Google Bookmarks. For backup of everyday programs and files, there are about a dozen reliable (and light) programs out there.

-Does not block some of the malicious sites, hijacks, and redirects out there. Instead, make sure you use HostsMan.

I hope this saves you both money & time. Good luck!"

"I found Family Tree Maker 2011 Essentials simple and fun for the beginner. While I am an experienced computer user, I have very little experience with genealogy. I found the Family Tree Maker software to be simple and intuitive to use. It installed easily on my Windows Vista machine and runs without problem.  I like the ability to control the appearance of charts and reports. The help section is useful and well indexed. It may not be good for the heavy duty user, but for my purposes it hit the spot."
My sweetheart loves that magazine
I chose the 4 star rating as I have just now started to view it.  I like it as it will meet my needs for home financial planning.  I would recommend it to anyone.
"....but on my little HP Vivienne Tam Mini, boy does it slow her down.
I installed this on an HP Touchsmart and a Mini. I used only the online instructions, because it is recommended to install in that manner, and the Mini doesn't take a disc anyway. Installation was fast and easy on both machines, and starts with a sweep of each machine. No problems with the Touch, but the Mini can barely load a page if a scan is in progress, and it's slower in general.
If you like great big alerts when something is caught, you will not like the subtlety of this Mcafee product, but personally I like it.
UPDATE: My little mini's hard-drive blew, so perhaps it was that which was slowing her down. Also, on the HP Touch, I love that it pops up when portions of a site are blocked."
"This is definitely not your mother's WordPerfect.  WordPerfect is one of the first word documents software available.  However, you will notice that this is similar to Microsoft Word.  Corel has made many software products, and they have a sustained reputation with software users.

I have installed this on Windows 8.1.  There was an easy setup with two discs.  I started using a table and although creating the table was easy, I was not able to click on a www link and have it automatically take me to the site.  But,  I managed to work with it anyway.

I love the step by step tutorials in the HELP REFERENCE CENTER.  This is vital with any software program.  And for further information you can log into Wordperfect.com and Corel.  You can log into more tutorials if needed.

Publishing to PDF is an important feature.  Anymore, these days, we are always sending files and preserving the file in PDF is critical for the receiver or for another device.  This program has a usable friendly feature for using and creating PDFs.  The capabilities are limited, but user friendly for those who do not need excessive PDF features.

Now,  mail merge can be challenging, if you have old Word programs, however, with this WordPerfect, the steps are very easy.  Macros...  another improvement from Older Word programs.

Also, other great features with WordPerfect are the e-book publishing software....so many people can certainly use this, as this is the era of self-publishing.  The disc burning software is a wonderful feature.

As I mentioned, if you have used only outdated WordPerfect programs,  you will be quite impressed with the Word Perfect Office x7 Software Program....  This is amazing with so many capabilities..  Rizzo"
"I've been using Quicken for years now.  The product more or less morphs into the same thing year after year.  This year, however, whenever I enter amounts into some of my accounts, I get double entries until I close the product and come back to see that the redundant entry has disappeared.  It's just an annoyance.  Also, this year, I haven't been able to sync some of my bank accounts, even with Intuit Customer Service on the line trying to help me."
So glad Amazon offers this gift card!!
"I love McAfee for antivirus and security. It has never slowed down my computer. Their interface is easy to use. I can find out quickly whether it has been running on schedule or not. This was not the case with other companies' software.

McAfee has good customer support as well.

I like that it will protect three computers as well. Makes the cost of the product to be more cost effective.

This is a great antivirus product and I recommend it highly."
"""Norton Antivirus 2002"" may not offer everything an average user might expect from it, but there are lots of good tidings about it. It is compatible with every Windows version that is not earlier than '98. It is easy to install and to update; and automatically repairs common viral infections without interfering in one's work. Also, it serves as a dedicated systems scanner and cleaner.
I have never experienced any problem while running it, and would be courageous enough as to recommend it. But that does not mean that it is a perfect software!"
Have used this product over a decade. This most current version is more problematic than previous ones. Live Update fails frequently on my older Windows 7 home premium machine. Have to re-boot and re-run live update once or twice a week. The full system scan seem to also be flaky; doesn't always run as scheduled; misses a day here and there. Still does an excellent job of protecting your PC though.
Great antivirus.  I never notice it except when needed (haven't run into any malicious software yet).  I highly recommend Kaspersky Labs Antivirus.
"First, buy your software here - it's cheaper than buying direct from the greedy toads at Intuit. Second - milk your MS Money Plus for as long as you can - it's more rational than Quicken, has a simple straight-forward presentation, and is easier to navigate. It's also more utilitarian for multi-national investing.

That said, Quicken has lots of bells and whistles, the data transfer from Money is fast and accurate, (of course, there are occasional anomalies, but a LOT better than starting over from scratch!) and learning the new layouts is fairly easy. For global investments, it's weak - you can't automatically update prices on shares listed outside the USA, and exchange rate updates are so far a mystery. Matching downloaded transactions from banks to entries made manually or automatically (not waiting for the download) is problematic if they've been reconciled.

As a long-time user of TurboTax, I look forward to an easy transfer of data from Quicken in 2011 - using a .txf file to transfer data from Money was never satisfactory, especially for foreign accounts and rental properties. There's a tax planning tool, into which you can import Turbotax data from prior years, but it's not good for complicated tax situations.

Presentation of data is clean and relatively intuitive (sorry, couldn't resist!) and navigation is simple. Account abbreviations from Money don't work, but that's just a niggle.

Being thrown out by Microsoft is just another reason to hate them, as there is but one reasonable alternative so far - Quicken. You'll be able to cope, but keep your eye out for a better mousetrap.

10 days later - - -

**** have been lowered to ***  The program is more work to use than MS Money by streets. Definitely not a productivity-enhancer versus MS Money Plus.

Mice keep getting into this program - for no apparent reason, downloaded quotes do not correspond to the on-line quotes of the source, and the program is flummoxed by the switch in ticker symbols for US options. After making manual entries, the program intermitently overwrites the price quotes for no apparent reason.

Banking is a pain - if you manually enter your check transactions as you go, when the bank download is done you'll need to manually accept each entry - and if your bank puts ""Check No. 1145"" into the payee box, you'll have to accept the duplicate entry, re-edit to show the correct payee, delete your original manual entry, and clear the blue air around your PC.

Getting news and individual stock quote information is a convoluted process that will make you long for Money Plus. Foreign currency transactions are a painto enter and control, and exchange rates are automatically corrected - another manual transaction has to be entered to correct back to the exchange rate actually experienced.

Recommendation :  Hang on to your MSMoney program until your last reasonable moment - it will save a lot of aggravation. In the meantime, pray that someone comes up with a more effective tool and scares Intuit into fixing this monster. The premise of Quicken is good, and the basic operations are great, but it is stuck in second gear when it comes to handling investments, rentala properties and foreign transactions."
"This is easy to install, works well and has a nice layout. I especially like the idea of the Wi-Fi Net Guard protection.

The layout of McAfee is nice. It is less cluttered than Norton.

The Navigation Center lays out the features in a simple an easy to understand way. The vulnerability scanner is a nice feature that helps a person see weak spots that make a computer vulnerable. If a person has children the parental controls are easy to use and work well. McAfee has a nice site that allows users to get information about threats.

I have used Norton for a number of years because I was not happy with McAfee. I am impressed with the changes made to McAfee. I now have McAfee on one computer and Norton on another. Hopefully the virus protection will be as good as the layout and ease of use."
"I've used a chemical shampoo for too long and my hair started breaking off! So with a lot of research I bought this! It has made my hair (which is thin with oily roots and dry ends) way stronger and shinny without being oily! It's really fantastic. I took a star away for 2 reasons, one is because the price is a bit outrages, and two is because if I use it every day my hair starts to get buildup so I have to find a clean shampoo that washes away the build up to use twice a week.."
Electric razors don't get a closer shave than standards ones so I got this.  This did not do the trick just smells bad.

"Honestly, I think you should wait a year or two before you upgrade most of the new features are not really relevant to consumers, but are aimed more at businesses. I don't know if they are shipping Office XP with Service release 1, but I think most users who would like to uprgade should at least wait until it is being shipped with the bug fixes. The applications look beautiful. They are easy to use of course, but if you are just typing documents, sending e-mail, adding numbers things like that stick with Office 2000. Because in these rough times you don't want to waste money on something you are actually getting over and over and over again. I'm not saying it's the same applications but for users who are doing simple things in Office it really does not make sense to buy something that is packed up with 90% of features you are not using. Just have a little patience and wait the year or two by that time Microsoft will be releasing Office XP 2005, and trust me they are, I read in an interview, where the Microsoft Office Team manager said the next version of Office XP will be based more on collaboration and services. I am making sure you don't make any regrets, buying this product."
"I agree with the earlier reviewers about the myriad positive features this upgrade brought.  Faster operations, better stability, exciting new features (e.g., batch bill pay, ability to handle options - finally! - auto balancing, better portfolio views, etc. etc.), and still a great price.  Even without the rebate, this is a worthy upgrade.  BTW, CompUSA has the lowest price I've seen.
The only gripe I have with Money is the still confusing interface, esp. for the new Money user.  I've used it for 3 years now and sometimes I still can't find what I'm looking for.  Luckily, the Help's search function is VERY useful and always locates the functionality I need.
Highly recommended."
Love it. Makes my hair just lovely and curly.
"If you are interested in your family history and want to create your family tree, the Family Tree Essentials is a great way to get started. I used to have a very old version of Family Tree Maker, so I was interested to see this new version. The 2012 version has a lot of features that my old one did not. There is also a free trial to Ancestry.com included, so you can get some serious research done during your trial period, which is a great plus of the software. If you are an advanced user of family tree software, you may find this software to be too simple. However, if you are new to family tree makers or just have a really old version, you should consider this 2012 version."
"I've been a past user of AVG products and have generally found them basically satisfactory.  It can be a little tough to say that any particular player in the home computer security field is definitely the way to go because for the most part their features and effectiveness are roughly equivalent to each other.

My experience so far with version 9 has been a mixture of good and bad.  The scanning speed, and the degree to which it interferes with other things that I'm trying to do, have been greatly improved.  There were times with version 8.5 that I would have to stop a scan before it was complete because it was making it too difficult to get my other tasks done.  In 9.0 that has yet to become a problem.

There have been some downsides, but nothing particularly unexpected.  I've had some difficulties with my computer issuing errors after waking up from being put in standby since the install, though I haven't managed to track down the cause in detail yet.  I also had some minor headaches with getting the settings right on the firewall so that a couple of pieces of software I use could function properly.  Honestly, when I install any piece of software that's X.0 I tend to assume there'll be a few errors and some general quirkiness in the behavior until a few patches have been released.  The issues I've with AVG 9 haven't been anything that goes beyond what I expected.

The main source of annoyance I've had, minor as it is, was that I don't particularly want my security software to be trying to influence my choice of what search engine to use.  I get security software because I want it to secure my computer, not so that it can nag me about my choice of which search engine I prefer.

Had I not been offered version 9.0 as a review copy, I probably would have waited for the release of 9.1 before deciding to upgrade.  Most of the time if someone asks me about whether they should upgrade to a new version of software, I tell them basically the same thing - if it's not urgent, wait until a few patches have been released.  If you do need to buy something now (or you happen to be reading this after a few patches have come out), AVG is a solid choice and should serve you well."
"Microsoft finally got it right with Windows XP (Home Edition).  Based upon the highly reliable Windows NT, XP is a stable, reliable, and thoroughly functional operating system that cures most of the flaws that earlier versions of Windows are known for.
First and foremost, the ""Blue Screen of Death"" is gone!  I run XP on three computers in my home via a home network, and I have literally never seen the dreaded Blue Screen.  While both Windows 98 (which I thought was a pretty good OS) and Windows ME (horrible!!!) require frequent re-booting, XP does not.  You can go weeks, even months, without rebooting XP.  It is stable and reliable.
Speaking of home networks, XP Home Edition does a very good job if you want to set up a peer-to-peer network in your home.  We run one notebook (via a wireless connection base station hub) and two desktops via XP, and you can literally set something like this up in less than an hour, counting hardware hookups.  The Networking Wizard actually works, and takes almost all of the pain out of setting up a network.  If you want a peer-to-peer home network, XP is for you.
One warning--XP does not support a domain (server) network.  If you are interested in this sort of configuration you want Windows Professional Edition.  You cannot use XP for this.
Windows XP is well-supported as regards various peripheral devices.  When I upgraded, I had no difficulty downloading the necessary drivers for my three printers, one scanner, and various other devices.  Most worked OK out of the box, but upgraded drivers are available from most vendors via the internet.
Speaking of the Internet, XP is truly dependent upon the Internet, and I would imagine that a user without Internet access would find XP very difficult to use.  XP is among the new generation of software of which Internet access is an integral design assumption.  The OS uses the Internet to register itself, obtain updates, and obtain drivers.  This is reflective of a trend whereby in my opinion every computer installation will in a very real way have as its centerpiece the Internet connection of the user.  Dial-up's days are numbered too--XP files, like most files nowadays, are simply too large for a 56K dial-up modem.
In my opinion Microsoft hit a home run with Windows XP, almost enough to cause me to forgive them for Windows ME, which was absolutely awful.  If you are using ME, RUN, don't walk, to upgrade."
"The reviews for Money 2005 are very good -- I suggest reading them all to see what you're in for.

The big problems for me were:

1) The ability to have separate category and subcategory lists was removed from the transaction form

2) I couldn't easily use the 'Transfer' category, especially in a split category

3) Annoying duplicate account creation

On the first problem, Money 2005 uses just one combined category-subcategory list, so when you enter a transaction, you must choose a category-subcategory from one big list.  I prefer two distinct selections because it's quicker to enter and easier to find my subcategories.  Microsoft provides a Registery edit in the following Knowledgebase article:

[...]

I used the edit, and my separate lists are restored.  Great, but I am irritated that Money 2005 removed this option and provided no way for a user to change this behavior short of a Registery hack.

On the 2nd problem, my ability to 'Transfer' amounts to different account was resolved once I split my subcategory lists from my category lists using the above Registery hack.  Now, transfers operate as they did in Money 2003, which is the last version I was using.

On the 3rd problem, one financial institution has, for the 2nd time, downloaded duplicate accounts.  I hope it's an anomoly, but we'll see.  Other accounts operate fine.

I haven't explored the strengths of 2005 yet -- this was just post-upgrade issues I've wrestled with over the New Year's weekend.  On the surface, doesn't look like much new is useful to me.

On the matter of online bill payment, I already had that through Wachovia bank (formerly First Union).  I guess what's new is that Microsoft now makes bill payment through Money work with many institutions.  Since Wachovia already provided this function, I don't think I'm adversely affected...or benefitted (though Wachovia dropped the $6 monthly fee for using Money's bill payment function).

One final piece of advice:  after you install, don't open your Money data file unless/until you have had Money perform all its software updates.  For me, I opened my Money 2003 file, was prompted to convert to Money 2005 file format, and then Money 2005 automatically downloaded software patches afterwards.  Wondering whether my conversion worked right nor not, I chose to open a backup of my Money 2003 data file using the patched copy of Money 2005, so any software bug fixes related to data conversion were already installed in Money 2005.

I gave it a 2-star rating based solely on the upgrade process.  This upgrade, bad as it was, was better than when I upgraded from Money 2000 to Money 2001!"
"This is great for many grades. Our son is in 4th grade and started getting this. It is one of only a few that he wants to keep getting (along with ""Sports Illustrated for Kids"" and ""Boy's Life""). The reading level is about his level, but it would be good from 2nd grade through 7th grade.
Like its parent magazine, the photos are professionally done and large. The content of the magazine is even more impressive. Nearly every page our son will come and tell us another ""did you know this"" fact.
Many topics are a two-page spread so that you can hold it open and see the whole topic at a glance -- very nice. There are also some jokes, mazes and other brief entertaining items as well.
The magazine is a slick glossy around 32 pages and very nice. If you are looking for an upgrade from ""Highlights"", this would be it."
Great!!
"Well I guess I didn't expect much from a film based on a low budget Saturday morning TV show, but this has got to be Ferrell's worst film to date. Sure the effects look pretty good with some nice dinosaurs and the Sleestaks, but the jokes that work are few and far between. If not for Ferrell, I don't think I would have laughed at all. Not only is the film bland, but it doesn't even know who its audience is, with some jokes that are very juvenile and others that are crude and may not be suitable for younger viewers. I'm not saying its unwatch-able, but there are so many better films out there than this boring turd. I didn't expect much, but with Will Ferrell I at least expect to laugh!"
great read
"I have been running Kaspersky Pure since version 1.0. I bought a pack of 3-year licenses which led me through upgrades to 2.0 and recently to 3.0. My overall experience with Kaspersky has been favorable; that said, it has presented some challenges along the way. My experience probably would be different had I installed fresh every time, rather than upgrade.

When Pure 3.0 was released I received an upgrade notice and I immediately downloaded the new version. Then, I kicked off the install without reading the instructions which ended up being a very bad mistake. The instructions state that other security suites, including previous versions of Pure, must be uninstalled first, a step I skipped. So, about 75% into the install the installer quit due to open files, leaving the install in an incomplete state. Worse, it corrupted the older version to a point that it could not be uninstalled, nor could 3.0 ever finish proper installation. The result was a system with a completely broken security install that could not be repaired. I am going to reimage that system shortly.

On a different system, I followed the install directions completely and the install was as smooth as could be. The lesson learned from this was to follow the directions, even if common sense says that it should uninstall older versions of itself. I could understand if it clashed with a competing product, but it should at least be smart enough to handle older versions of itself in such a way that the system is not left in a broken state.

Once Pure was properly installed, I have seen no issues. Other reviewers have stated that the product has a bad tendency to turn itself off, but I have not seen this with version 3.0 (though it was definitely an issue with 2.0). I am running Pure 3.0 on a Windows 7 64-bit system. There are enough others complaining of this issue to make it a concern and I have been watching for it but so far the product has remained stable and has not failed me. It's definitely something to keep in mind, though.

Pure 3.0 looks very much like version 2.0 and has pretty much the same feature set with a few additions. The application's main interface is a dashboard-style window with access to key features of the suite - backup, computer protection and parental control.

I have not used the backup functionality so I really cannot adequately talk to this feature, though I am glad to know it's there and may use it down the road. It allows for backing up important personal files such as movies, pictures and documents as well as defining a custom backup filter too. This is not a complete backup solution and is meant to be a way to back up critical data.

The computer protection section of the application provides access to the meat of Pure, including the scanning functions, firewall, anti-spam, anti-banner and more. All of these work together to provide a cleaner and safer computing experience. The two most critical functions, the scanner and the firewall, provide solid protection and so far have never let me down. I especially like the firewall which has passed every test I have been able to throw at it - port scans, file system access attempts and more.

The parental controls module is an important feature to me and so far I have been satisfied. I like that it allows for blocking out times when the network is accessible and it allows for category blocking which makes blocking whole classes of websites very easy. It errs on the side of caution and sometimes prevents access to websites that I regard as acceptable, and I would rather have that issue than have it allow access to objectional content online.

With the exception of the really bad installation issues I saw (which one could argue were my fault for not following directions), my experience with Pure 3.0 has been positive. It has been very stable and it has protected my system nicely. Going on my experience alone I would not hesitate to recommend Pure. Still, there are a number of others who have seen issues with the application turning itself off, enough so that it merits some consideration."
mag itself is pretty good but its mostly ads
A fun gift to give.
"TurboTax Deluxe 2015 does NOT include Schedule E or D.  For these forms, which are required for rental properties and capital gains/losses on stock sales, the Premier version is needed, and it costs $20-30 more.  Have a look at H&R Block for substantially less money for similar functionally as Turbotax."
lovely
Terrific magazine on a wide variety of firms both known and up in coming on Wall Street
Great item .fast shipping too
"I think this shampoo can be even five stars, hair feels soft and fresh. But I think it doesn't give that feeling of clean hair near my roots. It might be just not the right type for me. But in general I would definitely recommend these products."
Have been using HR Block for about 10 years now. Works just as well as Intuit without the bloated price.
"WordPerfect is a very good program. It has plenty of features and powerful editing capabilities. WP Office can't rest on its laurels and massive sales like Office can so it makes it up by pushing the feature set further. In particular, WP is much better at dealing with older documents, including docs from older versions of Office.  However, its one drawback is that it isn't Office and thus there can be incompatabilities with newer formats.  This can be a dealbreaker but if it isn't then this is a great, inexpensive choice for an Office Suite."
"It does its job, no problems, I got my refund in 9 days. Nothing much has changed since last year except the amounts of taxes"
"Corel VideoStudio is a great, affordable and user friendly software for editing videos. I'm not very tech savvy and usually find most  video editing programs too complicated and too cumbersome to use. I am amazed at how much you get with Corel for under $70!

The included instructions were also very helpful in getting started with the software, figuring out tips and tricks, etc."
"I have Trend Micro's Internet Security on one computer at home and Bit Defender on another.  I have to declare myself thoroughly delighted with both of them.  I knew Trend Micro from 8 or 9 years ago when I got to know it as a free online system scanner.  I used it several times to rid myself of pesky viruses that McAfee could not deal with.

The specific thing I like about the Trend Micro is that it really doesn't slow the system down at all, while providing apparently great protection (I've had no virus problems that I'm aware of).  Some antivirus programs I've used really slow the computer down and make looking at pages on the Internet a drag.  But the Trend Micro has been almost invisible.

I have been very happy with the feature whereby it clears out the malicious cookies that are downloaded onto my computer through surfing the Internet.  Each day it deletes spybots and data miners without my prompting it.

If you are looking for a very fine internet security program I can definitely recommend this one.  My assessment is based on only one month of use, but that has been a completely incident free month."
"The product itself, I find, is excellent and is an upgrade from the regular Norton 360 I had installed on my 3 PCs. I have used Norton Internet security, and then Norton 360 for years; it has served me very well. the 360 is very comprehensive as an antivirus and Network plus a password manager. It also has a feature when you do a search, for instance, to see which sites are safe, and which are known to be malicious, and shown with a green (safe) or Red (danger) icon next to the link.

 The upgrade procedure is a nightmare if you are trying to install it on to your PC as an upgrade, especially if you want to carry over remaining days from your current subscription of the regular Norton 360. quite a few reviewers here have complained about the same issue. The Amazon download purchase of this product gives you a link to Symantec's website, where you enter your logon credentials, and the registration Key into the form. So far, no problem. The norton downloader installs, which then downoads the Norton 360 Premiere install file. When it is done, it says it is complete, and you are given the option to activate it, which again askes you for your registation key. When you enter it, it gives you an error that it is for the incorrect product. Everybody has complained on this, and I thought I would be more successful, lol.
You wind up closing the window, and looking at your current Norton 360, and see no change, so you click on the upgrade link, where you can enter the reg key: same error. You look into the folder where the downoad went into (Premiere NEVER DID install) and double click the file, which then actually does something and tells you that it needs to first uninstall the old 360, and also gives your the very wise opportunity to save your user settings, like your password vault first. you reboot your PC, and all you wind up with is (No new Norton 360 Premiere), a little icon in the taskbar for the password vault. So you install it again from the downloaded install file and it is successful, and asks for the reg key once more.

Now, how do you get your remaining days back from your ""old"" subscription? You go on Norton's web site and finally find out how to start a Chat session, enter your info, and get put into the Chat que. I was number 104 in line to start. It took about 45 minutes to get a rep on the chat session.  I actually put this paragraph in the wrong place..  Before I even went to start the download and upgrade, I went to Chat first to be told the correct procedure, and the rep only said that before he can carry over the remaining days, I must first install and activate the Premiere product. He actually never told me HOW to do the above correctly.
He also gave me a case number to use after I activated the new product, so I could continue afterwards and get the days transferred. I did that this morning, and it took another 40 minutes to go from #44 in the que to chat with a rep. He got it done for me no problem.
So I have 2 more PC's to do this to, and it whould work out easy I hope.

I hate to sound like I'm bitchy and whiney, normally I'm not, but this really got to me. If only the instructions were clear and accurate.
If you have no previous product to upgrsade from, you should have no problem. Others here have advised to uninstall the old product first, but I thought I was smarter than them. Well, I AM NOT, lol.

Now WHY did I not wait untill my old product subscription expired? Because I wanted to make sure the reg key I got was valid and worked. The others were right. Uninstall the old product FIRST.

Still after all my complaining, I give the Nortonn 360 Premiere PRODUCT itself 5 stars. The installation/upgrade process: If it were possible, I;d give it a minus 10. If only I could go back 1 day in my life."
"I bought this program to replace TurboTax that I have used for many years.  Other than being much cheaper, I could find no fault with this also easy to use tax program.  I'll never go back to TurboTax during my lifetime -- it offers no advantage to the average user.."
"I wish they would be a bit more reasonable with the price on it.  But they know they have the market pretty much cornered.  And if you've used Turbo Tax for a few years chances are I likely wouldn't change to any other product anyway.  They got me, and they know it."
"I was excited with the Black Friday sale price of $29.95, but this is no bargain if you want to include graphics/pictures in your PDF files.  Corel PDF Fusion uses very heavy compression with no user control over the image quality.  This is particularly obvious if you have an image that includes high contrast text, such as black text on white background.  You will get lots of compression artifacts and the text will be color tinges along the edges.  I use Adobe Pro at work and was not expecting this product to compare to that, but I thought I could at least include pictures in my created PDF without the image quality being reduced so greatly.
Don't every try to fill in a PDF blank form with this product because it IS NOT WYSIWYG.  Forms that appear fine on the screen will print with text fields chopped of or print as blank fields.  Attempting to edit the text field to reposition it on the form is like working in the dark.  You have no clue if your positioning/sizing has been done correctly until you print it again.  Maybe the worst piece of commercial software I have used in over 40 years in the business."
Great
I have held off from writing this review so that I could be absolutely sure that Trend Micro Titanium is the software for me and my little computing center.  It is.  I have used it several months now and no matter what I throw at it it keeps me secure and I could not ask for more protection.  The one element about Trend that I like above all is that is works pretty much in the background and does not slow my processor that much.  All security programs will slow the processor some and some create quite a burden on the temper of the user.  Its footprint is small and its abilities are significant.  Of the several packages that I have used I like this one best.
"I have been using AutoCAD 2012 for over a month now and am extremely satisfied.  I installed the software on a Windows 7 64 bit machine with 12Gb of RAM.  The software runs very smoothly and I have had no problems with stability at all.  I have used several competing products and the latest version of AutoCAD continues to beat all.  It is bar none the best 2D drawing package on the market today.  So far I have seen no bugs.  The makers of AutoCAD are very good about releasing software updates when bugs are found and for providing other support.

What is the disadvantage of this?  Lack of 3D capability and a learning curve is about it.  I just wish the makers would release the full 3D version of AutoCAD at this price level."
"I've been using Quicken for twenty years now, and usually upgrade only when the program really changes for the better. Thus, having purchased Quicken Deluxe 2011, I would not normally have expected to upgrade this year. However, I was happy to do so as a Vine reviewer.

Thus far, after a month of use, all I'm noticing is that the new version is a bit smoother in operation, and a bit less objectionable on the eyes. However, that is already an improvement over last year's upgrade to 2011, which required a lot of effort on my part just to find everything and get everything working again afterwards.

This time the upgrade went smoothly. A few things to note: 1) the EULA (End User License Agreement) is as objectionable as ever. You have to agree in advance to whatever terms Intuit chooses to post on its Web site in future. On the bright side, you are now permitted to install the program on up to three computers in the same household. 2) The upgrade required a reboot afterwards. 3) The data format has changed again, so be sure to do a backup before upgrading. 4) On first use after upgrading, the old data is archived and upgraded. Likely best to get that out of the way before letting One Step Update do anything after the upgrade. 5) Afterwards, having been alerted a One Step Update had previously been missed, I did a One Step Update, and it now works on one bank with which it had trouble before. 6) In the lower right corner of the One Step Update window there was an alert about a further upgrade to release 3 being available, so I then installed that. Overall, a lengthy but not painful process.

The upgrade is safe but not essential for those who already have the 2011 version.

Update: I have become aware of one annoying behavior (bug?) that was also in the 2011 version. If I manually mark a transaction as Cleared while reviewing my account info on an account's Web site, then later do a 1 Step Update of that same account, such a transaction will both not be recognized as a match and also not show up as an option for manually matching. At that point, even changing the transaction's status to Uncleared does not allow it to be automatically or manually matched. The only solution I have found is to delete the downloaded transaction every time one step update is run."

"2015 was one of the better years for H&R Block's signature product.  In the past, updates were late and some parts didn't work as advertised.  This year worked well and updates were on time.  No complaints."
"I was not very familiar with AfterShot Pro. I am a huge fan of PaintShop Pro and have been using it for years. So I was curious to see if this might be a replacement to PaintShop Pro (PSP) or a useful addition to it for my needs.  I am not a professional photographer, but I am a bit of an enthusiast. I own several DSLR cameras and quality lenses and have taken some photos that have been used in professional magazines and other professional venues.  But it is a hobby for me and certainly not my day job.

That said, I have become very proficient in Paint Shop Pro and have learned to use layers and I have various different accessories that I use, including color cards, Wacom Intuous digital styluses and more.  I can put a program through its paces.

Let's start off with the basics. This is NOT photoshop. It isn't Paint Shop Pro. It is something else altogether although it does have overlapping functionality with both of those programs.  The simplest way I know of to describe it is a lighter version of Photoshop/PSP, specializing in automation and cataloging.  It is for the professional who may come home from a wedding with several hundred (or thousand, if he/she has apprentices working) photos that need a lot of the same things done to each photo. For example, they all might need the same color correction or white balancing. Or there might be dozens with the same facial blemish that needs to be removed... Anything that needs to be done many times to similar photos is easily done here, and wouldn't be easily done in photoshop or PSP.  Corel purchased a pretty good program called Bibble Pro and has put their team to work on stylizing it more like other Corel products so that it will interact well with them and be relatively easy to use for photographers and editors coming from other Corel products.  Being version 3 of a product that was in version 5 when they acquired it, AfterShot Pro 3 is a mature program with a fair amount of testing and real-world use under its belt.

The program is also very good for cataloging. It will let you assign metadata to your files so that later you can easily find photos with an in-depth search function that makes it easy to find photos with keyword searches, and searches based on location and time and date and more.

Another nice feature is that it is non-destructive. The program makes all of its changes to it's own files, which tell the program what to do to the original raw file - at no time is the original ever changed.  You may end up producing a jpg that is different than the original raw file, but the raw file from the camera will always be kept as it was originally shot from the camera.

I had some learning curves to overcome and a couple of things that bothered me. One of the features of this program is that it is supposed to have a light footprint and run well, even on older computers.  It is also supposed to use the processing power of higher end graphics cards (which I have) to help speed up processing, resulting in a much faster workflow when processing hundreds or thousands of photos.  However, I also found some glitches.  For instance, when making changes to things like white balance or color tone, the screen would give me a very jagged, low quality image that remained that way until I interacted with the photo in some way.  A mouse click or something else would be required to force the proper redraw.  I found this immensely distracting and annoying and I did not readily see a way to fix it.  It doesn't do anything to the picture (everything is non-destructive) but it affects how the picture looks on screen and is annoying.

I also found a problem with easily getting back to the previous setting if I did something that I didn't like. Yes, there is an undo feature, but sometimes you are working within a screen where you haven't committed anything yet (like a white balance dropper) and it is not easy to return to a previous setting that you liked.

Finally, I found some instances where drop down lists would not drop down, even though they should.

I have included a photo of the ""jagged"" effect that I encountered.

Overall, Corel has done a good job of creating an inexpensive alternative to Aperture or Lightroom and it interacts well with PaintShop Pro (AND photoshop, interestingly) so this is arguably a solid choice for photographers looking for an inexpensive but high powered and high quality alternatives to the big guys."
This gift card came quickly and the food was great. I had no problems whatsoever.
Old Version.  Already updated to new version.
"This product installed easily, did not interfere with any of the programs on my laptop running Windows 7, and did not seem to consume a large amount of resources.  Start up, web surfing, watching videos, etc., seem to take no longer than before this program was installed.  If you run a MS operating system, you need some antivirus program.  This one looks like a solid choice."
Just what I needed
"I have used Norton AntiVirus for many years now but switched to 360 last year.
The only reason I switched was because I got a $45.00 Norton/Visa Debit card with the purchase from one of the local office suppliers and I was curious.
I have been using a computer since before the commodore 64 days. (We engineers put them together from scratch in the late 70's)
I don't need Parental controls, Backup, Identity control (I question the reality of this one), or PC tuneup, as some of these functions can be done through windows.
A lot of the above 360 functions are nothing more than a pain in the rump!
Don't get me wrong, I like Peter Norton's stuff; his book PC-DOS (1985) helped more than any other to get me trained in the new floppy (No windows) world.
If you have lots of money to throw away, or feel that you need the parental controls, then the 360 may be the way to go.
If all you want is Antivirus protection, then this is your software."
"Norton's products used to be a trial to install.  No more.  Each release has gotten easier and the latest one is a breeze.  I bought this as a download.  Does anyone want or need CDs any more?  Can't beat the convenience.
Norton's anti-virus products always rate at or near the top in computer magazine reviews.  I've never had a problem with malware getting past them."
Getting a gift card beats trying to pick out something for a person and them ending up returning it later on.  Gift cards are a safe way to go.
"My software package says it's version 21 on the front, but the disk installed as version 20, still that's not what made this unusable. The package notes the Parent's Choice award for version 20 on the back so we still thought we'd be okay.  It says it works for Windows 7 and it did install (although I needed to input my administrator password), but then we got a shock when we started the software.  Instead of getting the menu shown on the box to take a lesson, play games or whatever, our menu said only 'teacher' or 'student'.  Turns out the software was for a classroom.  The password required to set up the 'teacher' option, without which the 'student' option wouldn't work, was said to be in the administrative manual.  Unfortunately no such manual came with the software. I can only assume the wrong software was on the disk so we are left high and dry.

Since the package is opened, I can't take it back to the office supply store where it was purchased and will have to mail the software and receipt to the company (address in 1 pt font which requires a magnifying glass to read) and the refund will take 4 to 6 weeks.  I tried calling the number on the website and got a ridiculous phone menu run around.  After listening to the options and choosing the one that seemed to apply another recording said a representative couldn't help and to interface with the web instead.  Surely I'd just chosen the wrong option and called again choosing the other option, but got the same message.  Why would there even be a phone number to call if they aren't taking calls.  Very annoying.

I can't speak to the software we expected to receive because we didn't get it, but potential buyers should know that if you have a problem, there is no support.  I'm willing to accept a mistake, but having the package say version 21, the disk say version 20 and different and unusable software actually install tells me this company has very poor quality control.  That coupled with no support  is a disaster.  I do not recommend buying this software.

Update: The website does not list the version 21 software as a choice in the technical support area but I tried another type of search and found it.  I had to email to get the missing password and was rewarded with a list of instructions to follow to get the software to work, including the password.  I'll try it tomorrow.  Hopefully this will help, otherwise the software is still going back."
Microsoft selling OneCare anti-virus? It has decided to make money off selling a fix to a problem in its original product (Windows). That's just offensive.
"This is just easy to plug in and install.  No more fiddling around with CD's.  In some ways this is easier to put away in a computer drawer as well and less likely for me to lose in my stack of CD's for prorams/drivers/etc.  I think The programs themselves work well and are fairly resource ""lite"".  I'm a careful web srfer, but it seems like Trend Micro does a good job of keeping me out of trouble and from trouble getting to me.  This is especially important since portable computing means I take my laptop/mini/netbook to public places."
Works great on everything.
"We enjoyed our night out, and the food was very good. I would recommend this to my friends and family."
"My fav mouthwash is Listerine no alcohol. Crest one for 50 years old+ (I'm not sure what age has to do with mouthwashes) is mediocre. Not the worse I've ever tasted, but not strong and refreshing enough for me. The worse thing is the bitter aftertaste lingering until I eat something so for quite a while obviously. I wouldn't buy.
My Listerine is a bit more sweet and leaves nice fresh breath for way longer."
"As of December 2009 there are definitely ways to copy the DVDs to a hard drive so that the DVDs are not required to use the program.

If you install the software and use the update option in Preferences to install the latest update then you get an option to specify where the DVD data is stored, and you just need to copy the contents of the disk1-6 folders from each disk to that location. Note that this copy process is rather slow (if you have more than one DVD drive you can do more than one copy at the same time) and the data are stored in inividual image files for each page so it has to copy around 34,000 files per disk. Each file copy seems to cause the DVD drive to seek back and forth across the disk once, which means 34,000 seeks per disk which slows the process significantly (to over an hour per disk) and also might result in a significant amount of wear and tear on the DVD drive (this is speculation).

Note that you'll need 50GB of available disk space if you choose to install all the data to disk!

The developers are actively updating the program and the latest Mac version has a ""copy everything to disk"" feature which does the work for you, and the Windows version should have this same function enabled literally any day now. The web site to follow for the latest info is COMPLETENATGEO.

This version of the Complete National Geographic is *much* improved over the one from several years ago. The viewing application is a much nicer application, it scales the images to the size of the application window nicely, and the full two-page spread images are quite readable on a 24"" 1920x1200 monitor.

Our local Costco has had a huge pile of these this holiday season, so I hope this review helps out some of the new purchasers looking for information about the product. If you haven't bought it yet, it's a great deal and an amazing wealth of information and imagery. Issues through (most of?) 2008 are included, and they say there will be an option in 2010 to buy the 2009 issues to add to your existing collection.

Highly recommended.

"I downloaded Quicken Premier 2010 from the amazon.com website, no problems.  I downloaded on two different computers, no problem with doing that (license is for up to three computers).

I've been using quicken for many years, and each version they try to put more bells and whistles on top of too many bells and whistles; I wish they would simplify the product -- help me simplify my daily tasks.  However, though it is a cluttered application with features of which I only use about 10%, it still gets the job done.  It is annoying that you are prompted to buy stuff, that downloading the app puts three new icons on your desktop trying to market more intuit/quicken products -- so what -- it is annoying, but not a show stopper.

This version loads fine, works fine.  No better and no worse than other versions I have been using for years, but just different.  I would have stuck with my old version, but I wanted to help a friend out with navigating their quicken -- so I got the new version too.

I recommend this product only because there isn't much else to compete with Quicken out there."
Love these shoes for circuit training.
"The Dragon NaturallySpeaking 13 is a really good voice dictating program. I am using it right now to dictate my review. Once you get familiar with the program, Dragon NaturallySpeaking works really good and is flexible to use with different programs.

I have used Microsoft speech program with Windows 7. While that program works well too, I found it more limited in its flexibility to use with other programs. Dragon NaturallySpeaking I can use within a web browser and other programs accurately. The program opens a sidebar which allows me to view a cheat sheet so I can become more familiar with commands while I use it. I definitely find making corrections a lot easier with Dragon than I do with Microsoft's speech program. Using the combination power the headset, speech, and your mouse and you definitely have a very powerful human-machine voice interaction that can be a lot of fun to use.

The stock headphones that comes with this program are not very comfortable, but you can use any decent headset and microphone you may have on hand. Right now I'm using my Turtle Beach headset that I find much more comfortable to use on my head. That said, I have noticed that using a better quality headset that my voice commands are better received as I am having less dictation mistakes to fix. When I was using the stock headset, I had a lot more mistakes occurring which led to frustrating moments. I haven't had that issue with the Turtle Beach headset yet. It's been smooth sailing.

Dragon NaturallySpeaking premium 13 is definitely a worthwhile program to have if you're looking for a more reliable speech dictation with your computer. I only recommend that perhaps you get a better headset to work with. Once you get familiar with this program you'll find it fluid, practical, powerful, and fun to use.

One of the features I found a little humorous was the option to choose what accent you use. Oddly it didn't have a Boston or New York accent, but it had southern accent option available. To me, it shows that Dragon is working to have a quality program that will understand all kinds of speech regardless of your accent.

I have use and played around with Windows speech program but Dragon NaturallySpeaking is the way I will choose to go. I find it easier, more fun, and more powerful to use in different programs."
Always a great meal and these e-cards are 'da bomb!
"I'm going to do a short review here and say that Corel has some advantages over Photoshop for photomanipulation or editing. Where Photoshop Elements (a fine piece of software) has you estimate or use your monitor and judgment for fixing photos, CorelDraw's Photo suite has an Integrated Image Adjustment Lab --and it tells you how you are going to affect the data on a RAW image, losing image quality by various adjustments. Instead of eyeballing what you are doing, you can retain maximum detail in highlights and shadows using their sliders and suggestions. When you exceed the limits and start to lose detail, an exclamation point crops up on the slider, showing you that you have degraded the photo quality. This is probably the best photo editing software I've used for that reason.

While I like the competing PhotoShop Elements for ease of use and the fun effect, CorelDraw has more professional features and the interface for photoediting is full of information yet easy to use. Big thumbs up."
"Installing and running McAfee on a Windows 7 laptop was easy and non-intrusive. It asked me to set up an ID so I could download and use it on 3 different systems, I did that for ease. It did ask for auto renewal that I declined and then it started installing. I had to uninstall a previous virus protection software that had expired before installing McAfee. It was not intrusive like setting up Norton on my other laptop.

McAfee takes care of virus protection and online security, it does make some sites load slower. Other than that it does not interfere with the workings and does not slow down the system. It also updated definitions in the background and did not make it a fussy process like Norton which kept saying ""Your system is unprotected"" and made me do several tasks manually before it was up and running.

The only negative criticism I have is that it deleted all my cookies without asking and also all my passwords that were stored in Chrome. That made life difficult, if I had known it would do that I would have first changed those passwords."
"I should probably admit that I am still heavily biased toward the old Broderbund version of Family Tree Maker. It had its issues of course, but it was so simple and intuitive to use. All that changed when Ancestry.com took over the software. It's not very ""new genealogist"" friendly, and takes a lot of practice to remember all the ins and outs of the program. Navigation is still a convoluted mess. It's nice software, I would say probably the best of what is available, but the learning curve could be a detriment to those getting started in genealogy. They have been steadily improving over the last few additions so perhaps in a few years they'll have a version that I like as much as my old Broderbund. There are lots of bells and whistles, the trees you can generate are nice looking, suitable for framing. If you get one of the Deluxe or Platinum versions it's nice to have a few free months to Ancestry.com, as the subscription fee can be quite cost prohibitive."
"Windows 8 (W8 hereafter) is one of those ""attaboy"" or E for Effort type of deals - it looks good on the surface but after using it a while it becomes obvious something is missing or not working properly.

As something of a background I've been using Windows since the 80s DOS days.  I'm not a newbie and have owned or worked on computers running DOS, 3.x, Me, 2000, NT, XP, Vista, 7 and now 8 from the MS family.

First, let's get down to the nitty-gritty.  W8 is not a new operating system.  It's a melding (or welding) or the Windows Metro user interface (UI) from their smartphones and Windows 7.  When you boot you'll see the Metro UI first but 7 is lurking in the background.

For those unfamiliar with the Metro UI, it's a series of tiles (square or rectangular) that represent apps.  Touching or clicking these tiles opens the corresponding app.  Great for tablets or touch screens, somewhat questionable for computers.

Second, priorities and functions are clearly set.  Metro handles apps while 7 handles programs and the two don't cross in that respect.  Although MS is coming out with an Office suite that works in Metro like an app, anybody with earlier versions of that software package will notice it doesn't work in the Metro app area but does quite nicely in the Windows 7 area.

If you have no experience with apps, the best explanation I can give is that they are program wannabes - sort of like putting racing tires on a Prius.  It may look sporty but you're still not topping 80 anytime soon so don't plan on racing a real sportscar like a Porsche.

But this is where it gets confusing.  Although Metro handles apps it also creates tiles for the programs (mostly) found or installed under the 7 area.  Clicking on these tiles doesn't open the program in Metro but instead causes a flip in which 7 opens and then so does the program.

For example, installing the LibreOffice suite for Windows will create tiles in the Metro apps (one for each segment of the suite) but clicking on them means your computer must switch from the Metro interface over to 7.

Fortunately, it's relatively seamless and many won't notice it right away and it became so fast over time it's hardly apparent anymore.

Without getting into overly elaborate detail I'm going to list the pros, cons and neutrals I've found in testing W8.

Pros

* Quick boots.  I average about 25 seconds to the Metro UI but read my note in cons below about the 7 boots.

* Actually kept most of my programs intact and those that wouldn't work anymore were probably not anything I really cared about to begin with (old XP relics, mainly).

* It's cheap at the moment.  Those in possession of a recently purchased computer can get Pro for $14.99 and those using 7 on an older purchase can buy it for $40 via MS ($70 through some of the online outlets but many are offering $30 rebates via gift cards).  I believe those prices are good through January.

Cons

* While the Metro UI boots in 30 seconds or less, 7 is still grinding away in the background.  In fact, if you click on the desktop icon in Metro and flip over to 7 right after booting you'll get the usual swirling circle indicating it has another minute or so to completion.

* Horribly installation times.  Upgrades are a rather torturous 2 hours and there were times I wondered if the process had failed.  Full installations fared better at roughly 45 minutes.

* Using a laptop on battery?  The Windows 7 interface has a battery icon but Metro doesn't.  The only way to tell battery level I could see was the force my mouse to the right side and then go to Settings at which time an icon pops up; however, it disappears when your mouse moves.

* It says it will save files, docs and assorted personal items during installation but I found that to be hit or miss.  Some were easy enough to locate but others just flat disappeared.  Never did find some of my music files.

* Apps are slow to open and I do mean slow, plus many of them won't work without an active internet connection.  In some cases it takes longer for apps to open than for W8 to boot into Metro.  Go figure.

* Metro uses a horizontal scrolling (left to right instead of up and down) and if your mouse doesn't handle that you'll better get used to grabbing the scroll bar at the bottom and dragging.

* Metro didn't create tiles for roughly half of my programs even though they were still there. That's why I ended up installing the Classic Shell program (read below under Neutrals about that).

* The new Internet Explorer is a disaster.  It's slow to open and failed twice to even open it's own MS website.  That doesn't bode well.

Neutrals

* Apps are limited at this point to a few hundred and some, like Angry Birds Space, are rather pricey at $5.  Google Play this ain't although I'm sure the choices will improve over time.

* Yet other apps sort of lie.  Free to me means no charge but some are just free ""front"" apps and you have to pay to actually use them to any great degree (such as Hulu Plus which gives you a free app but wants a monthly fee to view programs).

* The Metro interface is ugly and has limited themes.  Again, I'm sure that'll change over time.

* No Start button; however, I added a freeware program called Classic Shell and it restored the Start button.

* Like those desktop gadgets for time, weather, etc?  They are no more nor can you add them. MS dropped support and instead replaced them with tiles in the Metro area.  Fat lot of good that does you when working in 7.

* Many computers users I deal with don't like having a sign-on password but W8 requires one and I haven't heard of a successful way of getting out of it right now (some online hints I've seen are somewhat suspect).

Overall I gave W8 a three star rating (because I couldn't give 2.5 stars).  If you have 7 and are satisfied, keep it.  If you can get it for the discounted $14.99 it might be a decent investment but there is a learning curve so be prepared.

Update:  A neighbor found a snafu with W8 on laptops.  When shutting down the screen will go black but DO NOT assume the computer is off.  It actually has another 15 to 20 seconds before it fully shuts off.  As my friend discovered, shutting the cover before the power and/or hard drive activity lights go out means you might be sending it to hibernation or suspend mode.  As a result, the battery is still draining since the computer didn't shut down all the way!"
"Well, I hate to be a rare one of the bunch.  It was time to finally seriously use, on a regular basis from the beginning of the year bookkeeping software.

QuickBooks was a tremendous opportunity.  I love that Intuit has kept up the Mac development.  This 2012 software feels fresh and update to date.  I love having the powerful suite right on my Mac, ready to go.  I jumped right in and began using it for invoice creation, tracking sales, etc.  Wow.  It's fun to see all those numbers come up rather than sit there with the calculator and paper ledger.

I really love the gorgeous graphs that you can create from reports.  ""See,"" your performance.  It has an impact.

Overall, if you need business bookkeeping software for your Mac, what else would you choose?  QuickBooks 2012 seems to be the answer despite some issues that others are so willing to explain in detail."
I purchashed this software 5 months ago. I keep my computers OS updated reguarly. Newest security patches ect. Keep hard drive defrag ect. From the minute I loaded this product and it updated itself from their site the computer slowed to a crawl. Would refuse to shut down at times. Would love to freeze up when online. Yes it can scan files quickly for known viruses. But it you have it running while your working it's a dog. Found if I diabled it things were fine then enable and have it run it scan when I had free time to do somthing else. This has to be the worst piece of software that I have purchased in the 15 years I have owned a computer. I finally uninstalled it.
Excellent product! Have used Turbo Tax for many years now!  Very easy to navigate through the program!
"I have been a subscriber for years, but found subscribing online much easier and hassle-free.
This is a great guide for people that watch a lot of TV.  Guide and articles are all interesting and useful."
"I have several photo programs on my computer and several others that I didn't care for laying around. My favorite, easiest to use and quickest one to use has been the Microsoft Digital Image Pro 10. I also have the Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo XI and I've used it for my more advanced editing.
  Now this Corel PaintShop Photo Pro X3 takes the place of both of them. All the basic editing functions are pretty much intuitive and easy to find and use. It will switch from photo archive to basic editing to advanced editing and back to archive very easily. It comes with a book showing how to use it and there are online tutorials for its use too. I haven't got very far into its more advanced uses yet but I think this will be the last photo program I'll need for a long time.
  There is just one thing that I did not like about it and the installation of it. And that is it doesn't give you any choice, it takes over, on its own, and it goes through the entire hard drive collecting ever image file on it and puts them all in its photo archive. I would much rather be able to have the CHOICE of which photos and folders to put in its archive. But then that's something that just about every photo program I've ever tried does when its first installed.
  So if you want something more than just the Microsoft Digital Image Pro 10, or something to go with it, I suggest trying this one."
"Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite 10 is okay for someone who like to tinker with things.  It took me a long time to load on my computer after stalling out.  Once it was on there, it made my computer slower and I found that most of the features it has, I'm not interested in using."
Love chilis
"My first experience with Dragon Naturally was with Dragon Naturally Speaking 10 Preferred and it was OK overall but I gave up on it after a short run. I spent at least 40 minutes training it the first session, then I did additional trainings and it never was quite right. The commands seemed hard to implement on the fly. I figured that version 11--and the Home version at that--wouldn't be that much improvement.

I was so wrong. It feels like a completely different process than my first try. I installed the program, clicked on a few settings, and did a quick medium difficulty reading (JFK's Inaugural Speech) to train the software. I happen to have a slight Boston area accent, but it's not as strong as JFK's. That was it. I thought I totally missed something. That was the training?

I decided to test it on a fiction story I'm writing by dictating instead of my normal typing. I have to say, I am really impressed. It's like a totally new experience. I did 1500 words in half the time it takes me to type. I had to fix a couple blatant mistakes; I left a couple small errors to fix later (my typing usually has more errors). I used the ""dialogue box"" to redo a homonym several times.

*Deleting the last phrase, no problem.
*Go to next line or paragraph, no problem.
*Find a word/phrase in the dictated text to change, no problem.
*Enter ""quote"", no problem.
*Enter punctuation, no problem.

I was really tickled. Maybe Dragon does work as well as some people say it does. It did for me and right out of the box. I would've never believed it after my last experience.

"NOTE:  PC Download is the same as the CD software, not sure why the reviews are separated.  I downloaded my software, but entered my review in the CD product first, not realizing they were separated.

[This part of the review written in early Dec 2013]

So far so good. I just downloaded Premier this past weekend, installed on my Win7x64 machine with no problems. I imported last year's data, and then ran through an estimated calculation for Fed & State, saw only one problem (see below). My situation is a bit unusual: no W2, but Sch C, Sch K, college costs, and investment income.

Not much change from last year in the program's look and feel and flow, but obviously quite a few changes in tax law. I've been using TT for many years now (have also used competitors in the past), but I was mildly surprised by how quickly I was able to do everything.

The one flaw: when entering college costs in the ""interview"", the field for ""Room and Board"" didn't show up in the ""Other School-Related Expenses"". I went directly to the form (which needed some finding, it's called Student Info Worksheet), entered the value directly, and after that the field popped up on the interview.

Overall, I'm happy with the product, but of course I'll be even happier when I'm finally done using it in April!

[Update Jan 31, 2014]

So far I've downloaded several updates, and the program has continued to work without any hitches. I've been able to download 1099 data successfully from my financial firm, and the process of correcting the basis for ""uncovered transactions"" was simple (but you have to understand the basics here, of course).

On the downside, I'm finding that the guidance for business income & expenses is very poort, especially when you go to the state Sch C. Based on the descriptions, I'm not convinced that Home & Business will be better in this area, but I'm going to take a look at that."

"These balms are not sold in store's anymore unfortunately but I was able to buy them here but I hope there not selling this product when it's old because they stopped making them in 2005  when that was the last time I saw them in store's.. It helps me with my lip chilitis condition.. If you don't know what lip chilitis is, look it up and I recommend you buy this because it helps my lips to stay smooth and soft but who knows every lip chilitis is different in every person. I would repurchase this product again"
"Good idea.  I particularly liked the gift card attached that said ""Peace on earth.""  We really need that."
"Sage got a lot of bad press when they took over PeachTree, and I am not sure all of it was warranted. This Premium Accounting Software has worked really well for us, as we recently expanded our business and needed to do a more accurate and comprehensive accounting of our inventory, accounts receivable and payable, and our asset depreciation. We have been able to do it all with this software, without any major difficulties and a minimum of learning curve. (We have not used the other features, so I cannot comment.) I agree that the user interface could be slicker (especially for the price of the software), but at the least it is easy to understand, and hopefully, Sage will be working on that for the next release. I would definitely recommend this product for small businesses, especially those that are going to start using accounting software for the first time, as it worked really well for us. I cannot compare it to Quikbooks or any other products out there, as we have not used them. It certainly has made our lives easier now in terms of our accounting needs and documentation, and much more organized than in the past."
"I was very pleasantly surprised by this conditioner.  I went into trying it with very low expectations.  The mousse texture seemed like a gimmick, and I suspected it would not be very conditioning at all.  In reality, this conditioner left my hair soft and bouncy.  It comes in a pressured canister, like a mousse, and foams out and expands.  Don't go wild dispensing it, as it really does expand quite significantly.  It felt moisturizing when I put it on my hair in the shower, and not at all sticky (I had been afraid it would be sticky).  The smell is amazing- I'm pretty sure it's scented with essential oils.  It smells of citrus and mint.  Overall, I'm happy with the results, much happier than I anticipated."
"Norton has come a long way since this version.  This one was just not friendly to the user.  Most PC users don't want to work with the Internet Security software.  To be honest, I don't think the security parameters that I set changed anything."

"Those who have been using Quicken for any period of time know that upgrades are mandatory, as Intuit starts turning off functionality in older versions as time goes buy.  So every three years or so, I find myself forced to cough up $50 for a piece of software that does substantially the same thing as the previous versions (including all the same bugs).  Quicken 2011 is no different.  Here are the major drawbacks:

1. We continue to be unable to import any file from anyone who has not paid Intuit for the privilege.  Some smaller banks and many 529/401(k) programs do not want to spend their money on this so there is no way to download transactions from those companies directly into the software.  There is not even a simple import format that they could provide for manual import--that has been completed eliminated from the Quicken product.  They should at least provide that so someone could build a spreadsheet for import.  Contrary to Intuit's position, it is not rocket science to build a file with ""Txn Date"", ""Txn Description"", and ""Amount"" line items.

2. The UI unnecessarily provides all its own elements.  That is, it does not use the standard text boxes, toolbars, and so forth built into Windows that you see in a browser form and most other applications.  The result of this is a very slow refresh time every time you switch pages within the product or switch to Quicken from another application, noticeable even on a fast, modern machine.

3. About every six months, an account randomly gets itself out of balance.  TIP:  It is often the very first transaction for the account that has been corrupted--perhaps you started with an opening balance of zero four years ago, and all of a sudden the opening balance is $76.23 or something, so everything is off by that amount.

4. Ads abound.  They are littered across your desktop, your start menu, your program menu, your taskbar, the UI itself.  You cannot even start the application without being asked if you want a Quicken credit card before you can use the program.  I paid for this software--I should not see ANY ads.

5. You are not buying this software, you are renting it.  It will cease working with full functionality in 2014 (or earlier if Intuit's CEO has a bad day at the races).

6. Getting support is very spotty.  Support from Intuit itself generally consists of, ""let's try to uninstall and re-install your software and keep our fingers crossed.  If you have to re-enter 15 years of transactions across 25 accounts afterwards, well, that's too bad"".  You can get support from the Quicken forums, but unfortunately it consists primarily of ""yeah, that happened to me, too--let me know if you solve it"" and bombastic fanboys telling everyone else that it couldn't possibly be Intuit's software causing the problem; it is obviously your fault.

Bottom line:  The reality is that the only reason a thinking person buys this software is because there is no viable option, and Intuit knows it, which is why none of this is ever going to change."
"As a novice drafter, I was impressed by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AutoCAD-LT-2012/dp/B004RPUJ78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AutoCAD LT 2012</a>--a complex and expensive 2D drawing program. A little too complex and expensive and buggy for some purposes. For my reviewing convenience, Amazon Vine offered an affordable alternative in Corel CAD. Based on Ares CAD, this program goes beyond two dimensions to offer a powerful suite of 3D modeling and export tools. Yet it remains friendly and accessible.

That all said, AutoCAD LT is more capable for what it can do. I chose to focus this review on a comparison of 2D drafting.

--Package--

Corel CAD comes in a contemporary DVD case with the serial number and nothing else. No printed manual or PDF. Unlike AutoCAD, Corel provides a compiled html help file that doesn't require you to go through a web portal. Users can look up topics quickly, and interactive graphics help familiarize the interface.

--Installation--

Installing Corel CAD is even faster and smoother than Auto CAD. The program takes up 300 MBs according to my program explorer. The EULA is basic and I didn't see the resale restriction found in AutoCAD. The software can be installed on up to three PCs for private or business use.

--Operation--

The graphical user interface is simple, with most of the controls and panels up front at the start. This is also a clean GUI, colorful without being garish, with large button icons easy to memorize. That said, the menu icon in the upper left corner is a little small. Also, the upfront simplicity means you can run into the limitations sooner.

Contrast this with AutoCAD--a busy and intimidating interface, full of hidden menus and options to toggle, --but quite powerful and intuitive with practice.

Take polylines, please. AutoCAD provides a floating context overlay that follows your mouse cursor. The line can be manipulated on the fly with your choice of a right click menu, arrow key drop down menu, or keyboard command prompting. The overlay also shows at a glance the real time dimension or coordinate as you move the cursor. Once the shape is laid down, AutoCAD provides a variety of grips and handles that allow you to change the dimensions of a shape or relocate the points of the poly line, again with a quick-glance overlay. Hover the cursor over a grip or point and see the length of all lines connected to that point. The disadvantage is that all this feedback can overwhelm the novice user, and it can be easy to set something wrong until you learn the commands.

Corel CAD can draw the same line but without the feedback or flexibility. The cursor can lay down points blindly, without any overlay to guide you, or data can be entered into the command prompt at the bottom of the screen. The right-click context menu does have an Entity Snap override to help snap lines; otherwise it has fewer options than the Auto CAD equivalent, and there is no drop down menu or floating coordinates display. So there isn't much middle ground between the two extremes of mouse clicking and command prompts. I also found it more difficult to edit the dimensions of a shape like a rectangle, because Corel CAD does not provide handles, only grip points where lines meet. So for example, I can't simply drag a rectangle from two inches high to four inches high like you can do in AutoCAD. To the user's advantage, this streamlined interface greatly speeds up learning and drawing.

You can decide whether you want to keep watching the command prompt and properties box. I prefer the ability to see the dimensions in proximity to the object I'm drawing. Otherwise, Corel CAD is easy to pick up and learn, especially for the novice. While there is a lot of cross compatibility in function, Corel uses non-engineering terminology like ""print"" instead of ""plot"".

--Input/Output--

As advertised, I was able to create a DWG in AutoCAD, open it up in Corel CAD and vice-versa. Corel goes the extra mile by allowing export to Corel Draw or Designer file types. If you need a less propriety format, export to SVG, JPEG, TIF, PDF, and other graphic files. This capability alone hefts a leg up over AutoCAD, the latter mostly limited to the DWG family.

However, AutoCAD's plotting and PDF export features are potent and customizable. It also allows images to be inserted as an underlay, which Corel does not appear to have.

--Performance--

Corel CAD is a 32-bit program; in Windows it won't use more than about 3 GBs under normal system settings, even when used on a 64-bit OS. Like AutoCAD, I tested the program on two 64-bit computers running Windows 7 Home Premium:

> My old HP Media Center PC with a Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 4 GBs of Kingston RAM, and a Western Digital 7200 RPM hardrive with SATA 1.0.

>My new Custom Design Rig with an Intel 2500 quad core, 8 GBs of Corsair RAM, and a Crucial M4 solid state drive running through SATA 3.0.

As powerful as it is, AutoCAD crashes from time to time even after patches. Corel CAD has so far been stable, without a single crash. However, I haven't tried to draw large and complex designs; I would expect it to slow down and destablize as it approaches the memory limit. Once the system cache catches up with the program, it boots a little faster than AutoCAD--about 45 seconds on the old system, and about 5-6 seconds on the new.

--Get What You Pay For--

For all its accessibility there's a lot Corel CAD doesn't do as well. Precise 2D objects are easier to draw on the more complex and expensive program, provided you can get over the learning curve and bugs. The cheaper and simpler program is easy to learn, but I ultimately discovered that I liked AutoCAD more for 2D drawing. For me, the whole point of these programs is to draw well, so both the money and the quality questions come down to this.

If you don't need the fancy overlays, underlays, plotting and boxes, Corel CAD is much more affordable. While it will probably peter out against a 64-bit AutoDesk program, it is stable within its range of work and offers a wider breadth of workstation compatibility for the student, home or small office user."
"Best sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner ever! And...I've tried many. A little goes a long way, so don't hesitate to buy this wonderful product. ."
"I really wanted this to work. I was hoping to plump my hair at the roots and have some volume for my blah hair.  I tried it on three occasions, each time working a small amount into towel dried hair (as the instructions state).  I noticed nothing.  No volume, no lift.  Nothing.

Each time I used less and less, and still ended up immediately with a greasy feeling in my clean hair.  In fact, it seemed to weigh down my hair more than anything else. Plus, I had to rewash immediately to get rid of the oil feel. Ick.  Not only does it feel gross, but makes me wonder what is going to get on my skin....sometimes hair products that are oily can cause pimples and breakouts."
"Loaded fine for others here and there but I should've waited: it crashes on the RSS FEEDS SCREENSAVER and won't run Photoshop. The average novice or casual user will follow the simple prompts, but consult an expert first! The promises of easy back-ups and colorful add-ons (Safari, I'll admit, is a lot cooler) can't restore what just won't run right... and I keep a tidy Mac.

Slowed down my eMac to an unbelievably crawl. Reinstalled with an archive, but no change.

Nice overall look and nice features... IF they work for you, but ""Dr Mac"" Bob Levitus advises to wait; you'd better listen. I can't get ANY help on fixes and Apple's forum is really a long list of people begging for help.

Love Apple, but..."
"A will is a must even if you don't have much of an estate. If you die without a will your estate must go to probate and that will just be added delays,expense and headaches for your family. This software makes it easy to prepare a will and give you a chance to let your final wishes be known out as well as sparing your family the hassles of probate. Its the best gift you can give your loved ones."
I switched to mac after Vista problems. I love Leopard and everything about the mac environment.
"Mac version is a shadow of the PC iteration.  The ""One Step Update"" basically doesn;t exist since the Mac version requires a more advanced sync system on he bank side than the PC version.  This is NOT worth the Amazon price in the least.  If it ws 20-30 less, maybe.  For now, stick with Boot Camp or a separate PC and run that version.

PS The Mac and PC versions are incompatible, so even the migration is a royal pain..."
I spoil my puppy
This is a great gift idea for anyone in your family! Good selection of restaurant gift cards to choose from and makes a perfect gift!
"It worked fine. Some areas of instructions could use improvement. But the ability to talk with and ask tax questions (maybe for an extra fee?) of a tax expert is very worth while. I think with Tax Act it's only via online chat, but I'm not really sure."
"I upgraded from 2015 quicken.  I don't find the improvements to be worth the upgrade, and I am finding glitches here and there with the new program. For example, after downloading transactions and accepting them, the ""done"" button does not always appear.  I have to go out of that specific account and go back into it to trick the button into appearing."
Use it every day. Simple to use at a great price.
"What can I say, everyone likes getting gift cards to Amazon and I like it when you can adjust the loaded price to fit odd numbers. My oldest son just turned 39 and I was able to load it with $39 -- a tradition I have for birthdays for my kids and others close to family. He really liked the mock-up tiny Amazon box it came in. So did one of his daughters. I'm not sure who ended up with the box."
"have used Pinnacle 17 for a year, and I don't find this a substantial upgrade. The new features include more sound tracks from Triple Scoop Music, plus 64-bit capability which substantially increases the speed, at least on my computer running Windows 7 64-bit. The ability to capture videos from the internet is a major plus, but I had that in 17.

The installation went well. I was surprised at the amount of time required. I had a box come up indicating the progress of the installation. Nothing was happening. I thought perhaps something had gone amiss, but eventually another box showed up giving the status of installation of each of the components.

All my projects from Pinnacle 17 transferred easily to Pinnacle 18. There are additional editing features I will try with 18, but the important point was that I didn't lose any data in the transfer.

The package is easy to understand. If you're unfamiliar with video editing programs, there are helpful videos. It's not a bad package to learn on. However, if you're already using Pinnacle 17, I don't think the upgrade is that impressive unless you're running on a 64-bit computer. If your are, it's well worth it."
No
"Easy to use, worked well, didn't disappoint."
Great little magazine!
as described
"While I found the software easy to use, I was quite irritated to find (at the very end) that to e-file, I would need to pay $17.95...and an ADDITIONAL $17.95 to e-file my state return!

Why on earth did I pay $40 for this software??  I downloaded a free version from the company's website last year.  The purchased version doesn't include much extra.

Now I have to print out my return and mail it in, because I'm not willing to spend a total of nearly $80 to do my taxes MYSELF!  I notice now that this fee is buried in the description above, but it certainly is something you'd have to know to look for.  It should be in giant letters right below the price!

Irritating."
"I have this installed on my work computer. While it seems to function without issues, it is intrusive, with too many pop-ups and too many requests to restart the computer. Kind of annoying."
"Having been a user of Rosetta Stone products for some time I was off and running very quickly with the Chinese language course. The software is easy to install and interesting to set up and get immersed into.

A word to the wise though. Some people may approach this process very casually and try to either blast through it or not take it very serious. I can only say that any user, regardless of their background, needs to take it slow and pace themselves.

1. Approaching learning Chinese with this program should be like taking any college course.
2. You should take notes and keep a journal of your progress.
3. After the first three days you should start to chart your progress.
4. You should practice with the system at least an hour a day for the first five days.
5. You should speak aloud as many of the phrases as you can after every period once you've stepped away from your computer.

You don't have to be a native speaker to stay on course and progress, but please don't think that you'll be disappearing into the crowd or ordering deftly from the menus of out-of-the-way dim sum restaurants any time soon.

I recommend this program for people who have a serious yen, no pun intended, to get a jump start on taking Chinese. Some folks like to think that taking a foreign language is about memorization and  repetition. But that just isn't the case, if it was, we'd probably all be home schooled via VCR.

Listen to me, nothing can compare to learning Chinese in a classroom, under pressure and under the gun of requirements and deadlines. The benefit and the beauty is participating with other classmates and going over the material in a setting that can also build your confidence. Learning at home alone, with a set of headphones doesn't really give you this, even though you may walk away with some sound basics. If you're going to study this over the summer and then concentrate on a double semester course in Chinese, you'll probably excel and be the star student. In this scenario, I cannot recommend it enough. If you're going to lock yourself in a dark room and try to learn Chinese with this, don't get your hopes up. You'll discover that the moment you open your mouth.

Best of luck, kind regards and don't forget your local Community College or State University."
"I have been a happy TT Deluxe user for as long as tax software has been produced and was taken back last year with some loss of features so I was cautious as I looked for this year's software and started to read reviews first. What really stood out was the EXTREME difference between 1 star and 5 star numbers for TT Deluxe and what was brought forth in the 1 star reviews. Out of curiosity, for the first time, I began examining the ratings for other  tax software providers and am convinced that I need to change.

Goodby to TT Deluxe until I see a change in your response to user (dis)satisfaction!!!

PS. After a LOT of research on tax program reviews on other tax programs, I just ordered ""H&R Block 14 Deluxe"". Really looking forward to this experience!

Update 1/9/2015: Installed the new H&R Block yesterday and it went in with absolutely no problems or ado. Will know more and give another update when I receive the State program and do my taxes. Also, it only cost less than $24 which beats the heck out of TT!"
Great gift to give!
TurboTax always dependable.
"Trend Micro is known for reliable, easy to use software and security. Internet Security 2010 builds on this reputation and brings us an even better product for 2010. Easy installation, total protection for internet users. The Amazon price is just right for this product. Easy to install and easy to use without any extra bells or whistles. For the casual user, this product should be sufficient. But if you are an internet junkie, you'll need something with a little more umph. Trend Micro makes excellent products which perform the duties they are intended to do. It's fine for what it is - just don't expect it to do something that is beyond what it is. Does not drag down your system every time it scans the way some other products do. That's a big plus!"
Delivered as advertised.
"As far as features, I agree with much of what's been covered in the other reviews.  There's much to like in this program; however, I've installed the upgrade on two different machines (the Small Business version on a Dell Dimension 8200 desktop, and the Professional version on an IBM T40 Thinkpad); upon intallation IE6 immediately began generating run-time errors.  I've been using IE since it was first introduced and never had experienced a single run-time error; now I get them constantly.  In checking the Microsoft support sites for both Office and IE, I found I'm not alone in experiencing this phenomena.  It's extremely annoying, and the standard response from MS is: ""it's probably due to spyware"".  Well, I've been running Spybot and AdAware for over a year, and my machines report no spyware (the Thinkpad is only a week old), but the problem persists (and didn't exist until I installed this upgrade).  I can only conclude that any spyware causing these problems must be embeded in the upgrade!
So, beware of the potential for IE6 run-time errors if you install Office 2003.  Also, if you use Act! (or a similar program) that runs on top of Outlook, you'll find that a supposed new security feature in Outlook requires you to manually permit Act to retrieve e-mail from Outlook every time new mail arrrives.  It's a real pain!!!
To summarize, there's not enough in this upgrade to justify putting up with these problems (or features, in Microsoft parlance), and I wouldn't have upgraded had I known what I was in for."
great Christmas present
"This is a powerful program with almost too many features to mention.  I would carefully read the description to see which features will work for you.

I have found the program easy to use (on a PC) and the learning curve is not bad.  It really gives your PC many more options for working with media.

Highly recommended!"
"We have used allot of Antivirus programs over the years but usually return to McAfee because it works...it's good.
This one can be used on various devices and I can't say I noticed much by way of bloatware and slowing down any of the devices it is on which is a phone and 2 PC's. I also had no issues with installation. I think for the 25 dollars and protecting many devices it's a good deal!"
"This is a simple, step by step program that allows to build a basic last will and testament.  When I mean basic, it allows to cover the steps that you need to think through, in GENERAL, with regard to basic statements, basic building steps, correct wording and bequests.  And for most people, this is sufficient.  The interface is super easy to navigate, and it produces a clean basic will.  The advance directives, power of attorney documents are also easy to navigate, complete and print.

What this doesn't have (that I could find) was a way to recognize living members of your immediate family - to stave off court challenges from relatives that felt that they had been slighted; because that kind of thing can and does happen.

I also liked that there is also a proviso for your electronic accounts and files.  Most people think of ""things"" or ""money amounts"" when it comes to bequests, but seldom do we think of who gets our electronic files, digital pictures and the like.  This also includes a schedule of electronic subscriptions, apps, emails, credit accounts, online banking, etc. and so on.

However, this program is NOT an easy bypass for wills that are overtly complicated and involve legal maneuvering outside of basic bequests.  So if your estate planning does involve advance tax planning for heirs, etc. you will need to work with a licensed, qualified probate attorney."
"This is easy to complete.  If you want to go super complicated, then you probably need a lawyer and such.  Most of us have pretty straight forward concepts we are trying to set in place.  This does the job.  We have pleased with the product."
"This soap goes on as smooth as butter.  Even with the bits of stuff I'm sure is there for exfoliation, I only sense richness.  The floral scent is light, not overpowering, and I don't notice myself wearing it after my shower is done.  The bar is much fatter than standard bars from the grocery store. Even though it feels like it melts in my hands, it actually lasts and lasts.  With this soap, I shower in the lap of luxury."
"This is my 29th review and completed adventure in the Nancy Drew series.

First, I'd like to start by dividing my review into two factions.
1) The game itself
2) My personal detective work.

* PART 1 *

PLOT: Nancy Drew is off to the City of Dreams? [Is that right?] No? Anyway, she gets to rub elbows with a Soap Opera Star in the Big Apple. Oh yeah, there is the confusion; isn't this supposed to be in Hollywood? Well, it's all about climbing the ladder of goodwill and what better way than through the entertainment industry, right?

INITIAL SCORE: 85

CHARACTERS:
Mattie Jensen: The girl of the hour. Stick with her and you'll go far, kid. Well, all she did was sit around rehearsing lines, but that is the life of an actress. I did see her one scene she had acted which wasn't bad. No, I don't think she's the culprit. Why is she dating around so frequently like that? Ick.

Mille Strathorn: That silly old bat. Loved her riddles [half have been done before in other venues]. I think she is getting a little senile, but I don't think it was enough to be considered the culprit, especially since she owns the place.

Lillian Weiss: Man, she needs to get la.... wait, this is a family show. She was just a mean girl, but her abrasiveness was so strong that I doubted she was the culprit.

William Pappas: I only heard grumblings from his office. If he don't physically appear in the game, he ain't the culprit :P

Dwayne Powers: This guy was just falling apart! [Financially, second-guessing his relationship with Mattie, etc.]  I am glad he cast me as an extra! Yaahhh!

Rick Arlen: He was a smooth talker and a couple of his one-liners made me smile, but I had him firmly in my target sight as the evil villain.

Phone-A-Friends: This has got to be the 2nd best interplay in the relationship of Nancy/Ned aside from the Captive Curse argument. They said they loved each other! That was amazing only Adventure # 2 into the series since I don't believe I have heard it since. By game # 31, is the romance getting stale? This version of Bess had an odd accent and I believe this particular game was the most helpful George has ever been.

CUMUL SCORE: + 2 = 87

SCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:
The background music was a little blander than other games, but it didn't detract from the ambience. You have to forgive the cartoonish graphics from 1999.  Overall, it was fine.

CUMUL SCORE: Even = 87

PUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: Like I mentioned before, the riddles were intriguing since it hasn't been done again in the series. There were no mini games. :(  In fact, I think HER went with plot and culprit motivations over cheaper filler material, which makes this game stand apart from the later adventures in the series. [And that got fans to trip over themselves with praise for the good old days.]

CUMUL SCORE: - 2 = 85

GENERAL IOTAS: A lot of little bugs involving linear plot being halted unless you were perfect with clue discovery. I think this frustrated fans and the later games featured this process less.

CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 84

ADVENTURE ENDING: It was ridiculous in the scheme of things how bland it was. I am not necessarily complaining, but compared with other endings, this was definitely bottom 3 for HER all time.

CUMUL SCORE: - 2 = 82

* PART 2 *
I try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to
take weeks! Well, it took me four days [7 hours] and I gave myself a
Detective Score Of : 81

My Strong Points: The games I was given, I mostly aced.

My Weak Points: Swung and missed on the culprit.

OVERALL GAME SCORE: 82 + 81/2 = 81.5 [ B - ]

BOTTOMLINE: Cracks the Top Ten! Not bad considering the problems with computer programming in the late 90's. Just goes to show that story can outclass most visual and sound appeal. Perhaps HER can Remaster THIS. The poorly released Secrets Can Kill didn't really deserve the Remaster even though the nostalgia of the opening game was understood.

"perfect, product worked as stated, basically no set up, just open box and go.  Looks well constructed. Would recommend product to others."
"After getting fed up with Corel's completely mangling and ruining of PaintShop Pro and the sheer klunkiness of gimp, I decided to load up PhotoPlus X4.  I was happy to find that this application has most of the commonly used editing tools: crop, resize, fill, layering, layer masks, adjustment layers, etc..  I'm going to give it some more time but my assessment right now is that it is a legitimate alternative to the overbloated PaintShop Pro with an interface that is much more usable than gimp's.

One critique I do have is that if you lose your media there is no reasonable way to acquire a download for the version you own.  I would even be open to paying a few dollars to get the media back but they do not provide this.  My advise is to make multiple backups and store them in different places including the cloud so that you can restore in the even that you lose your media...."
Used Norton for years.  Great protection! Get from Amazon at better price that automatic renewal price from Semantec/Norton.  Don't get it.  I'm a multi-multi-year user.  What's with Semantec.
"Lots of improvements with this version. There are new array features, which I liked a lot...especially being able to copy along a path with different spacing options.
The help commands are also much better.  Even if you don't know AutoCAD's terminology you can pretty quickly find out how to do what you need.  This is very helpful if you're coming from a different software.
Some of the commands are still buried, like creating a new layer.  I know you can use quick keys but it could also easily be accomplished with the right click menu.
So, it doesn't matter if you're familiar or new to AutoCAD, with a bit of work you'll master this."
"While Popular Mechanics is for a little bit of everything, and Popular Science is great for ideas, Discover is pure science.  Sure, there is some speculative science, but for the most part it is solid and well thought out."
"It's simple: If you have a newer Mac, you need to get Leopard. It's the best OS X yet, and it's why you own a Mac. Blows away Vista in terms of features and usability, and it's a great first OS for people new to computers. It can be as complex or as simple as you need it to be. It's very intuitive, and has a lot of features that are just ""Duh! Why didn't anybody else think of that?"" in their brilliance.

If you're a PC/Windows person thinking of switching, now's the time. Leopard includes Bootcamp, so you can still use full-featured Windows XP or Vista if you want, but I think once you see how nice it can be to use a computer with Leopard, you'll wonder why you ever liked Windows.

Sorry to be ""smug"" (as anti-Mac people might say), but I'm happy with the fact that I switched from building and doing tech support for Windows PCs to the Mac platform. It's just better. It works.

If you're a gamer, you might want to try using this to load Windows Vista Ultimate on a Mac Pro or newer iMac... But if you're just a person who wants to do your work on a computer without worrying all the time, then Leopard on the Mac is the way to go. All your Windows apps, all the great Mac apps and bonuses, and all in a package that costs less than any decent version of Vista."
"This foot file is pretty much just an oversized popsicle stick with strips of sandpaper glued to the front and back.  Dont get me wrong  theres nothing high-tech about any foot file, but some are better than others, and this one is about as bare bones as you can get.

While I do indulge in the occasional professional pedicure, Im a big DIY pedi girl.  This foot file doesnt have the right texture to do a decent job of sloughing off dry skin, and you can forget buffing any calluses  its way too wimpy for that!

Bottom Line:  Low-end, ineffective foot file; not recommended."
Liked the holiday box
"A lot of people have reviewed Windows 8 the ""product"" here but few have mentioned the ""upgrade"" process itself so I'm going to include that too. First off I love Windows 8 and think it was a bold and innovate step for Microsoft to take. I use both Mac OS X and Windows operating systems and honestly feel with the release of Windows 8 Microsoft has surpassed Mac OS X. That being said I just bought a new MacBook (which I consider my main computer) a few days before the release of Windows 8. After I saw and used Windows 8 on a few PCs and laptops in local stores I was blown away and wanted it. However since I had just bought a MacBook and my existing PC (which I use just a couple days a week for work when I work from home) was a few years old I couldn't justify a new PC or Windows Laptop at the time. However once tax season rolled around and my refund was in hand I ended up buying an 11"" ASUS laptop with Windows 8 and began using it more than any of my other computers. So when Amazon offered me the Windows 8 upgrade via the Vine program I decided to take the plunge and upgrade my old PC.

I removed the DVD from the package and just before I put it in my computer drive I chanced to read the fine print on the back of the box. I had assumed that my existing programs would still be available on my PC after the upgrade since every upgrade I've ever done before from Windows 95 up to Windows 7 always preserved my programs. But according to the back of the box the Windows 8 Upgrade software did not preserve your programs if you were upgrading from either Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate (which I was), Vista or XP. I debated about whether to proceed with the upgrade or not, however after looking at my PC I realized that since I used it primarily for work with VPN and Remote Desktop there really weren't many programs on it so I went ahead with the installation.

The installation was very straight forward and the whole process took maybe 30 to 40 minutes, with no glitches along the way. Just put the DVD in (make sure to pick the appropriate 32 or 64 bit version - both came in the box), follow a few steps on the screen and eventually enter your product key, wait a bit, answer a few setup questions. That's in.

Indeed all the programs were gone, but settings had been preserved.

Later I read that there are two versions of Windows 8 upgrade - this version (Basic/Regular) and Pro. The pro supposedly would allow you to preserve programs according to a couple of articles I read on the net but I have no personal experience with it so I can't vouch for it.

Any worries I had about my old PC running slower with Windows 8 than it did with Windows 7 were soon dispelled once I began using it after the upgrade. I really do think that to get the most out of Win 8 you need a touch screen, which I had gotten used to on the ASUS laptop. It becomes an intuitive process after you use it awhile, where you perform certain functions with the mouse, others with the keyboard, and others with the touch screen (especially scrolling, and zooming)."
I love every article in the Reader's Digests copys.
Very complete program for managing personal finances. It is one of only several programs I would not be without. It is handy for looking up purchase dates of various items. The Net Worth section is great for year to year comparisons. I use the stock portfolio for keeping track of all my stock transactions. The reports are excellent and easy to customize for virtually any task. This is one program I have used for years and would not be without.
not much I can relate to
"This item came with WIDCOMM software.
After the installation, it worked very well.
I ordered several more, but it was no longer

I wish it had been available when I was a kid!

The installation was easy and quick.  The directions that are printed on the small pamphlet that comes with the CD are a bit vague but I was still able to produce this short animation in about ten minutes.  That includes capturing the 39 frames it consists of, saving the project, and producing it as a movie file.  It is still very rough--but this is my very first attempt at doing anything like this and I can sure see the potential of this software.

My original intention was to add some audio to the clip that sounded liked an insect buzzing.  I wanted it to look like the eyes were following a fly that ultimately lands on its face--but the sunflower seed I took from a bag of birdseed really looks more like a nose than a fly so I decided not to spend the time adding audio right now.

I'm very impressed with all the stuff this software can do.  I can add voice-overs or background music, capture frames from a pc cam, digital camera, camcorder, or images files from my hard drive. As an artist I can't wait to try their image editor which allows me to enhance, draw, paint or add text to any of the frames.  With more time I could change that sunflower seed into a fly!  The one feature I'm most interested in right now is the blue/green screen swap feature that will allow me to change the background!

Bottom line:  Highly recommended for creative individuals of all ages!

P.S. I have actually spent more time writing this review than it took me to make the short animation!"
"I have used, upgraded, been held hostage by, hated, and reviewed the highest level Quicken finance program releases since the days of windows 95.  I have now once again been strong armed to ""upgrade"" this complete piece of garbage.  If there were ANY OTHER program available I would have left it in an instant years ago.  Each new edition is more buggy, with useless ""enhancements"" and more annoying and constant messages to buy upgrades, and of course a large price increase.  This extortion plot is made possible by Intuit killing the download ability of your installed program so that you cannot communicate with your online accounts until you pay a ransom in the form of an upgrade at an exorbitant price. This is very similar to the gangster protection rackets of old. The ultimate insult is that the offered special discount price is about $35 higher than the retail price available everywhere.  The constant annoyance of dealing with password and data glitches, and the Intuit corporate greed  have tipped the scales so that the supposed convenience of a one source finance management program is no longer viable.  The tax data export and capital gains modules have never been reliable.  Since all you can do with the program is download banking and investment information already available from the source for free, this application makes no sense.  I will not pay to upgrade Quicken again.  I strongly recommend that no one ever start using it.  ADDED LATER:  After using it a few days it has crashed three times and completely trashed my modest investment accounts losing track of my cost and  account balances and completely vaporizing one stock holding.  So far have been unable to recover even with backup retrieval.  God... I hate this software.  ADDED LATER AGAIN:  Now have installed update 5 which took 3 attempts and upgrade 6 which installed after two crashed attempts.  Now my program crashes EVERY time  I attempt an automatic account update.  Before the upgrade it only crashed sometimes.  Nice job Intuit.  This is pathetic.  Zero stars is too much.  ADDED 5/9/16.  Today Intuit added a new Intuit password feature that has locked me out of all of my online download files.  All attempts to recover have failed.  Intuit principals should be jailed for fraud."
Office 365 is less than $100 per year for 5 users.  We purchased this and our kids use it on their Macs while my wife and I use it on our PC's.  What did we do with the 5th license?  Donated it to a friend who is a single mom and widow.  It's really nice to have that flexibility.
"I've had mine for about 9 months - lately has frozen up. Will not sweep, update, or even display alerts. Efforts to obtain techical support directed me to re-install - hopefully it works, though you never know if it's really working until it doesn't"
"If a gift card has the balance you purchased, I guess it gets five stars!"
"Excellent value and protects and tunes up the computer, does the job."
Break out the magnifying glasses so you can read the overly worded articles.
"This being the third generation of Apple's UNIX-based OS X operating system shows refinement and attention to detail.
The greatest proof is the invisibility of the Unix underpinnings. Even administrator tasks can be handled with ease. There are an abundance of setup utilities (""wizards"") and familiar system preferences (like control panels.)
The Macintosh has always meant simplicity, ease of use, powerful utility and just plain fun. Panther continues the tradition and enhances the experience.
Should you upgrade? Panther works for all G4 & G5 based Macs and MANY G3 systems. (PowerBook G3 Wallstreet and original PowerBook G3, G3 Beige and some other G3 systems are excluded from the supported systems list.) Essentially any G3 or higher Mac with built-in USB is supposedly supported. Panther has proven to be extremely stable. If you have a G5, Panther is almost essential to keep you up-to-date with all the hardware features and fixes becoming available.
If you have a G4, you PROBABLY want to get the upgrade to be sure to get the latest enhancements and fixes. Many of the graphical improvements require high-end graphic cards to see the benefit, though.
If you have a G3, first check to be sure your system is supported. Go to the Apple.com web page and select the ""Mac OS X"" tab. Then click on the ""Upgrade"" tab then select the link for ""Check the system requirements"". If your system passes muster, you may want to consider Panther because of the latest updates. You probably won't notice too many speed improvements or enhanced graphics capabilities. However, since it is a stable upgrade and has a number of useful new features it is worth considering.
If you have Internet access, getting updates is as simple as launching ""Software Updates"" from the Apple menu. There are many new features, outlined in the Amazon review and detailed at the Apple web site, ""Mac OS X"" tab, ""New Features"" tab.
For me, my favorite new features are Expos and Fast User Switching. With Expos, hit one function key and all your open windows slide aside so you can see your desktop. Hit a different key and all windows are visble, in miniature and aligned. Click on one of them and it pops to the top of the heap.
Fast user switching allows two (or more) separate users to use the same Mac at the same time. Each gets his/her own desktop and preferences. Select a user name from a new users menu at the top, right of the menu bar and enter that user's password and poof, your desktop becomes the other user's desktop. One user can log out and the other user can keep going. This is a real boon because both my wife and I are Mac addicts and still need to share one Mac (after all, isn't sharing what marriage is about?)
Overall, I feel Panther is a worthwhile upgrade, but the price may be prohibitive to some."
The shampoo and conditioner both work very well. My hair feels softer and looks fuller.  I'm very happy with it
"Norton AntiVirus 2006 [Old Version]-  I purchased the program from the lower cost used section of the Amazon product listing section.  The only difference between the one I received and a new one was the outer packaging carton.  No problem after installation.  Much lower cost.

"The Corel Photo and Video Pro X4 Ultimate Bundle combines photo and video processing/editing suites into one bundle.  The two programs work very reilably, offering the most frequently-used editing techniques - not quite Adobe firepower, but a great fit for most users' needs, particularly at the price.  For photos, you can layer images and apply brushes and other texturing techniques.  The video suite can handle source standard- or high-definition material and allows simple yet powerful editing - the add-ons included also permit very nice-looking on-screen titling.  As with any video editing software, you'll need a pretty recent processor and a good deal of RAM for reliable results - check your PCs specs before buying."
I suggested on my site to share the subscription price with a friend. This mag has a few good ideas but no exactly on the pulse of my life.
"Norton's latest antivirus program does the job without bogging your system down with features.

The box is just a download code so that novices may be confused.  You go to the Norton website, create an account, and add the code.  Then you download your program.  It works on either Mac or PC

The install took less than a minute after the download to install, and I didn't need to reboot. This software is a basic antivirus without advanced firewall features.  I like this because full firewalls often get in the way.

This box is only one license, which is a steep price compared to competitors.  They offer free tech support, but I've always had bad experiences with their tech support. Language barriers are extreme with Norton.  The ""no-virus"" guarantee requires auto-renewal of the program.  The guarantee means you get a refund if you get a virus, not necessarily the virus removed."
Just what I wanted- this is my 3rd bottle. I hope it will still be available next time I need more.
"My brother wanted a gift card from once of his local restaurants.  I chose this Red Lobster card because I've eaten so well whenever I've gone there.
The nearest location of a Red Lobster restaurant from our house is over an hour away, so it was so nice to be able to shop for these gift cards at my favorite online store."
"This is our 15 year using Turbo Tax and have seen very HAPPY. My returns have never been questioned, because TT guides to the best and most honest. Every year TT is improves."
Auto-Renewal stinks and I don't recommend it if you don't like surprises!  Great magazine for the whole family with food articles and informative information.
Nice...as expected
"This software is the same as the 360 Total Security - Free Antivirus & Internet Security for PC 2017 [Download] also available on Amazon.  Both download the same installation from the same host.  These are great programs.  I use Advanced System Care from iobit.com too.  Somehow, this program disabled the Advanced System Care program.  Other than that.  I love it."
"I currently use Norton and it expires in a couple of months. I've used McAfee in the past and it seems as if its really trying to be competitive with this 2016 version of the Anti-Virus software.

There is no CD which I like. The last thing I need is another CD. Rather there is a card with a security key that allows you to download the software from the website. Of course, you'll need to create a McAfee account if you don't already have one.

Some of the features this software claims to have are:

Supports Windows 10, 8.1, 8 and 7
Windows - blocks viruses, malware, ransomware (this is a new one for me), spyware, unwanted programs, wi-fi protection, web safety, PC Optimization tools, anti-spam and parental controls and file protection

Mac & IOS = 10.8 or higher - anti-malware, firewall, network manager, web safety tools for MACs and anti-theft, file protection for iOS tablets and smartphones
True Key Identify Manager - Quickly and easily log in to sites, apps, and more using facial  recognition for up to 5 user accounts

Android devices - 4.0 and higher - Data backup, anti-theft, app privacy, and wi-fi protection for tablets and smart phones
Privacy Protection - Privacy, encrypt files stored on PCs

Free Support - Technical support, security advisers, and customer service available for the life of your subscription

Security Management Console - Check security status of all devices, remote location, lock and wipe your lost or stolen tablet or smart phone.

This is a 1-year subscription. A couple of red flags, one being that this product claims to protect all your devices, but only 5 User Accounts. My household has 3 PCS, 3 Laptops, 3 Tablets and 3 Cell phones. Also, this software claims to offer a lot and I can't properly review what it actually does until I actually install it in January, when my Norton subscription expires. One of the reasons I went from McAfee to Norton is because even though McAfee made some great claims, I was still affected by a virus, the apps associated with the virus are very intrusive especially on my Galaxy Note, that I had to uninstall it.

I will provide an update when I install this software. But it is important to remember that with the increasingly savvy techniques from hackers and other people who have nothing better to do than destroy your expensive computer equipment, that it is possible for any anti-virus software not to be 100% effective. It's also important to use common sense."
Love these organic products. This one is a Little pricey though. Great product nonetheless.
"I'm sure there are lots of new, convenient features in this latest OS and that I'll be discovering them little by little.  Like many Apple users, I keep buying the machines so I won't have to fool around with too many peripheral and cosmetic distractions.  Give me fast word processing and CD burning power and I'm happy.  One minor irritation with this program is the difficulty of seeing which programs are active and inactive.  Instead of a black triangle, Apple is going with a little white egg-shaped marker that either doesn't show much of the time or is simply washed out by the screen and dock design--a veritable ""house of mirrors"" reminding me of the climactic scene in Orson Welles' ""Lady from Shanghai.""  Apple Discussion Board advisors acknowledge the problem and have directed me to a site from which you can download your favorite dock design from a choice of hundreds.  The only problem is that the skimpy instructions plus the steep learning curve (be prepared to go 4-5 sub-folders deep, switching the contents of folders while keeping the ""wrong"" name on the original dock folder, typing in instructions on the terminal to ""Kill all docks,"" then uttering a prayer) all but gave me--a simple, machine-dependent, computer-illiterate Apple consumer--more than I could handle.  I wound up having to reinstall Leopard and am for the present simply ignoring the question of whether the unhelpful, spotless icons in the dock are representing an active or inactive program.  Hope Apple figures out how to really light up  those indicators for a later version--or simply carries the Leopard theme a bit further and gives us unmistakable dark black spots for active programs.

(Later)  I'm getting hung up far more frequently with Leopard than Tiger (which is still installed on my notebook computer)--necessitating annoying ""force quits"" of both iTunes and Safari.  Just installed Apple's latest upgrades, but the annoying ""eternally spinning wheel"" is still appearing when more than one window is open.  Thanks to the notebook, I can keep both systems going simultaneously, but so far the Tiger is winning the fight in this zoo-keeper's Apple domain."
"Yes I've come out of the dark ages because I've been doing our taxes by hand, pencil and paper, for years.  And just not the simple 1040 and standard deduction stuff either.  Rental property, depreciation, Excel schedules, etc.  But I have to admit, tax time was not too much of a drudgery this time because of TurboTax.  I'll continue to invest the $60 - $70 bucks in the future."
"I am a long time TurboTax user, and Premier this year shows progress from previous years in most areas. Importing W-2 and some investment data is a breeze, although several mutual fund entries had to be made manually. I found that switching between the interview and forms was less than optimum this year: the forms menu was touchy and hard to navigate accurately, and annoyingly, was not complete.

One huge oversight is that form 1040-V, which anyone who owes tax needs (although you can technically file without it), is apparently missing in action. It did not print with my return, and when I went to forms it is not even in the list, making a trip to the IRS web site necessary to manually find, print, and fill out the form. Strangely, the corresponding form for my state taxes did print with my return and was accurate. TurboTax also had an issue with my state taxes when it wouldn't accept an entry I made (correctly) from a 1099-R. It insisted a certain number (a state tax ID number) had to be seven digits long, yet the number (which the payer, Fidelity Investments, confirmed) was nine digits long on the 1099-R. TurboTax would not allow me to overwrite the field, and I had to write a cover letter to file along with my state taxes (which necessitated paper filing). The program also lacks a decent search function. I had a complex issue involving a payment taken as stock which I had to research completely on my own (the J. K. Lasser book is still a great tool to have on hand). I also find that for both the 2006 and 2007 tax years TurboTax is inflexible about keeping your files in anything but PDF format, which I consider to be a major inconvenience.

Overall I still find TurboTax the best self-preparation tool on the market, but it is not without its frustrations. I recommend the program, but caution that if you have complex returns, TurboTax is not a perfect tool and has some subtle flaws that pester the user."
this company is greatest company i like Norton every year

GOOD
"Not much you can say, it does what it claims to do:  install Windows 7 Home Primium SP1 64bit on your computer.

I bought a computer for travel recently and it came with  Windows 8.1.  I didn't like Windows 8 and I was having a lot of trouble with the computer.  The tech I use told me that I had to two choices: reinstall Windows 8.1 or buy Windows 7, which he recommended as being better than Windows 8.  Having used Windows 7 for several years on my ""main""computer, and having had a good experience with it, I bit the bullet and bought Windows 7.  It was like bringing an old friend to my new travel computer."
I received a 30 day trial of this software from Microsoft. I used it to update my website that is hosted by Yahoo. I had to load the FrontPage extensions to the server then convert my current pages to FrontPage. This made me go through the process of reformatting nearly everything. The simple on-line tools that yahoo provides did a better job and quicker than this software. I suppose if you really are an office expert and want the look and feel of the office interface then you might like it. Otherwise I think you can do better elsewhere. This software takes the cookie cutter approach to building a web presence. Microsoft was offering a 30 day CD trial but have stopped that. I wonder why they don't want you to try it out any more before you buy it? Why indeed!
"We've all seen the commercials for Rosetta Stone on television. Given the mass of ""instant satisfaction"" commercials on tv, it's easy to write this product off as another one of those scams to relieve people of their hard earned money.  It was sort of with this attitude that I approached Rosetta Stone.  I've had a mild interest in Japanese for some time and so, decided to take the plunge with the Japanese version of Rosetta Stone.

Rosetta Stone comes with the software for installation on a computer, audio cds for use to practice while on the go as well as a headset for use with the software itself. Installing the program is easy enough, and then one gets into the nitty gritty of using it. The program is fairly well laid out and intuitive and it's easy to get started.

As others have described, Rosetta Stone's main goal is to encourage users to speak the language actively.  Immersion is undoubtedly the most effective way to learn a language as it forces the speaker to use the language and converse in it under practical circumstances. As one who's taken a few language courses in my time, I can say that while book study has its uses, to actually learn a language for practical use, speaking and hearing it is absolutely vital.

Rosetta Stone attempts to get as close to that experiance as possible with its teaching style. Do do this, it uses images, spoke words and a return responce method. The user speaks into a microphone to respond and the program has the facility to ""listen"" to one's pronunciation and correct it when off.  For a tonal language such as Japanese, pronunciation is absolutely vital to avoid translation errors.

The Rosetta Stone method is quite effective in helping to train a person's mouth to make the correct sounds and get used to saying the words. Japanese is a language quite unlike English, so this is a real benefit of the program. I found that it really did work in helping me retain vocabulary, though I did struggle at times.  The progam is fairly well designed from a flow standpoint, with various lessons occasionally repeating themselves as you progress to help reinforce retention of the material.

In the end it's not a perfect method, but for the self studier, it isn't terrible.  The down side is that Rosetta stone uses a call responce method and so a person does not get the conversational experiance that builds confidence and teaches in its own right. Practical conversation is unexpected and fluid, something that a computer program cannot emulate. I could see that this program would be a godsend if used in conjunction with actual classes where one could practically apply what they've learned. Repeating rote phrases is a lot different than actually speaking.

Another thing I noticed is that Rosetta Stone's focus on speaking actually has a downside in that it seems a bit weak on teaching proper grammer. It uses the language method of teaching by showing differences in gender and verb conjugations and the like as you go through lessons, but it's not very deep and a lot of it is inferred. For someone like myself who has taken numerous language classes over the years, I was left wondering if learning vocabulary and grammer in this way was really enough. Given that all I know about Japanese is what I was taught by Rosetta Stone, it's hard for me to say.

The use of Japanese characters is another aspect of this program that threw me. I took the advice of one of the other reviewers here and studied some of the Hiragana on my own to avoid using Romaji (latinized written japanese). It was good advice.

A word to the wise, this is a pretty in depth program. While commercials and the like seem to imply that this is the ""easy"" way to learn a language, it's like any other method of learning a language. It's work and a real investment of time. Daily study will make this program its most effective and probably push a student deeper into the language than basic classes would.  But it's likely to take months rather than weeks to progress to the point where one has a deeper grasp of the language.

I didn't use the language CD's (which cover the lessons in the program), but I could see that if someone was in a hurry to learn even more quickly, these might be quite useful for usewhile in the car on the go.

From personal experiance, I learned more Japanese more quickly from this program in a couple months than a comparative spanish when taking a couple years of that language.  That's saying something."
"Our government is pretty intimidating and especially with the personal income tax system. Rather than hours of trying to figure out government instructions with their tax forms, I use TurboTax, and their e-filing for both FED and State, and their audit insurance program. I once worked my way through an IRS audit just after I liquidated a small business at a great loss. The IRS agent came to my home and offered her my PC which had Quicken and QuickBooks and she worked on it for a few days. Then I moved to California and continued with the IRS through ten rounds of mail and response. The IRS found my books clear and well-supported, but the time spent was considerable, and the tummy acid on my side even more so. So I pay for Turbotax plus add-ons. What we really need  is a serious tax reform where filing is on one sheet of paper."
"This is a good program if you have a sole proprietor business, easy to follow ,there has been a problem down loading the selected state. Turbo Tax customer service has been very helpful in solving this problem"
If you have body acne this product is a must. I noticed a difference on my back and chest within the first week of using this body wash. It helps heal what is already there and helps prevent 95% of it from reoccurring!
"I thought this software would make it easier for a total novice to get started in genealogy.  Nope. All it did was succeed in making me frustrated.  I quit & never tried again.

Too complicated & too confusing.  There has to be better software out there."
"There are other genealogy programs out there but this is one of the better designed ones, especially for people new to the field. And with the six month subscription to Ancestry.com, the software essentially pays for itself. Ancestry.com and FamilySearch.org are two of the best online genealogy resources and this software helps you use both, especially if you don't want to work online 100% of the time. You can create files by importing and transferring previous files from other sources, such as GEDCOM, too, so if you are not new to this, the software is still useful.

That said, the navigation is good, but not always intuitive and there will be frustrating moments. But that is part of the pain and joy of family history research anyway. One of the more pleasing features is the ability to download images easily from the web--like census pages--and add them to your file. The software is strongly tied to Ancestry.com obviously, but it is a great resource, primarily if your family has been in the US for several generations at least. Otherwise, you will need an expanded international subscription and are going to face more frustrations--not associated with this software!--trying to find the information you want about those who came before you."
"it's ok, but it doesn't work with windows 10 !"
"Prevention is a magazine anyone can benefit from with great ideas on easy lifestyle changes. On the flip they are not very specific, although geared more toward a female audience. Some issues are excellent and some are average, but always informative and positive, never condesending."

"Don't know why I shouldn't expect this... more bugs again this year.  Entered all our Wages and Income data from W-2 forms, Ameritrade 1099s, and a 1098 from the checking account.  Entered the data perfectly and precisely.

Ran Error Check just now and it throws 12 errors.  Starting with Line 12 items from the W-2, which it wants RE-ENTERED, as it thinks THEY ARE NOT THERE.  Then it asks for Line 1 items from the Ameritrade 1099DIV, AS IF IT WERE NOT THERE, and then it asked for the 1098 info AS IF IT WERE NOT THERE.

Re-entered all the requested data, even though I KNEW THIS WAS A BUG IN THE SOFTWARE, and then it throws and error dialog message about a duplicate W-2 form and how I can E-file.

Digging into the Wages and Income section, I can see that the TT Premier software has now created a small DUPLICATE w-2 form, and a small duplicate 1099DIV form, both of which I have to DELETE.  THIS IS CLEARLY A SERIOUS BUG THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED.

And, at tax time is NOT THE TIME to find out that my expensive copy of TT PREMIER has bugs preventing me from completing an not-very-complex return.  It's a shame, too, as the software otherwise would have gotten perfect marks.

I WELCOME A REPLY FROM THE TT MANAGER WHO READS THESE REVIEWS ON THIS BUG AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING ABOUT IT."
This is still my grandparents favorite magazine. I give it as a gift every year for Christmas
"I gave this software a 3, simply because I didn't want to give it a one as it is not fair because I cannot reasonably review this software. I have tried several times over the last couple of weeks to install this software with no luck. I just tried it one last time and it still didn't install. When I ordered this software, I automatically assumed it was for Windows and after thorough inspect, I've found that this software is for MAC only. I'm running Windows 10. I've used Roxio products in the past (a long time ago before digital video). I've been able to burn media onto CDs and DVDs, which I no longer need to do with the advancement of digital, however, I thought this software would be a fast and easy way to compile my photos into one place, like on a DVD or other form of media. I don't see a 14 version for windows. And judging by the reviews, I probably would save my money on the Windows version. I hate that I missed that small bit of information."
I have no complaints about this app absolutely love it
"For people running the Windows 7 Release Candidate, I'd just like to confirm that the Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade Edition works fine for a clean install on top of a Windows 7 RC installation.

I had been concerned that I might need to go back and reinstall my old copy of Vista in order to install the Upgrade Edition, so I was very relieved everything worked fine on top of the RC.

As part of setup, the Windows 7 Upgrade Edition scans the disk to check that you have a valid version of Windows installed.  On my two systems, it accepted the Windows 7 RC.  I chose to do a custom ""clean"" install, so I deleted my existing partitions during install.  After installing Windows, I entered my license key and activated, without any issues.

I've been running Windows RC for several months and I've been very pleased with it.  It's very stable, it seems significantly faster than Vista, and it has got rid of most of the redundant security conformation dialogs.  Happiness!"
Habla YES!
"I purchased the three user license, downloaded the latest release from ZA's website, and installed on three fairly new XP PC's.  All have from 512 - 1 GB RAM and processors at least 3 GHz.  This program killed ALL THREE.  The other reviews were totally accurate, boot and shutdown take forever, the computer slows to a crawl, everything just dies.  Click to open a browser and wait five minutes, click ctrl+alt+del for task manager and cross your fingers because even that is hosed.  And if you see the icon indicating a scan is in progress, you might as well go find something else to do for an hour or two.  The scan takes forever and it completely freezes your PC for the most part.  You have a better chance of hitting the lottery than successfully deactivating the scan (or active updates).  I tried everything, tweaked all the settings, checked for updates, tried all the suggestions from the ZA forums and support boards.  Nothing worked.  And I'm not a computer newbie.  After finally getting fed up, I tried several times to uninstall but I keep encountering an error that the ""truevector"" service cannot be stopped.  So I'm basically stuck with it unless I go in and rip it out manually.  I just activated my license at the beginiing of the summer but I am so disgusted with this product I plan to uninstall it from all three PC's and go with something different.  I hate wasting the money on this program, but I honestly don't know what happened to Zonealarm.  This version of ZAIS is easily the worst AV product I have ever used.... EVER."
Thanks
"I have been more than pleased with all of the Pre de Provence Soaps I've used.  The Lemongrass is a wonderful scent, a bit stronger than the Pre de Provence Verbena.  All of the Pre de Provence soaps have a rich lather and the bars last quite a long time.  The scent doesn't fade as the bar gets smaller."
"I've become interested in going to Germany and although I know that English is spoken there, I'd like to be able to go off the beaten path and immerse myself in the culture.  I'd also like to be able to understand the conversations of people around me.  This is why I really was interested in Rosetta Stone versus a quick and dirty travel language CD.

This product allows you to customize it to your goals (read, write, listen, speak) through a very simple startup screen (which can be setup for different users) and then it automatically builds the lessons for you.

I find the lessons to be enjoyable and very useful. The speech recognition aspect is awesome. It lets you even customize how precise you want the software to grade your pronunciation.

Aside from the computer aspect, this product provides a whole set of CDs that complement the main software. This is great for reinforcing your learnings when you aren't in front of the computer.

The downsides of the product do NOT outweigh the upsides in my opinion. However, I should list a few for you. 1) It is pricey. 2) It doesn't allow you to run it on more than one computer (you can move it to a new computer, but you have to uninstall it from the first computer). 3) The included headset is a bit flimsy.

Bottom Line: If you are wanting to learn the language, excel when presented with multiple ways to learn it (visual, auditory, and written), and want to do it at your own pace, I really think this is a great option and can recommend it. If you are only wanting to pick up the bare minimums for surviving travel in Germnay and are on a budget, find another product that focuses on getting you into the basic phrases you'll need. Overall, a great product."
"Like the other reviewers, I too am ""blown away"".  This is the best security software on the planet!  Easy and quick to load, no problems.  It seems to be doing a terrific job protecting my PC.  Highly recommend!"
"I have used TurboTax for at least 25 years and it has served me well - until I filled out my 2014 taxes.  So what changed (other than the unconscionable increase in price)?  Well in 2014 TurboTax suddenly discovered that it had been incorrectly calculating depreciation on foreign rental properties.  Instead of using a 40 year life the software used a 27.5 year life, which only applies to properties located within the US.  This occurred year after year despite the fact that TurboTax explicitly asked if the property was located in a foreign country, to which I always checked the ""Yes"" box.

Because of this flaw all of my tax returns going back to 2005 had incorrectly claimed too much depreciation on my Canadian rental property, thereby requiring me to file a complicated Form 3115 to request a change in accounting convention.  Furthermore, I have to report extra income over the next four years so the IRS can recover the excess depreciation I took.  This, in turn, pushed me into a higher tax category and increased the amounts I will have to pay in Medicare premiums.

Judging from the outcry on the Turbotax user forum, many others were also affected by this incorrect depreciation calculation.  I suspect that thousands of taxpayers were impacted.  So why hasn't anyone filed a class action suit against TurboTax?  Well, if you read the software license, by using the software you give up your right to sue Intuit and must settle your grievance in binding arbitration.  Arbitrators almost always find in favor of the company so why even bother going there.  Furthermore, the fine print in the software license states that Turbotax does not guarantee that the software will produce the right answer so you use it at your own risk.  How convenient - for Intuit.

I have had it with this shoddy company.  I'm switching to the new guy on the block: TaxAct.  It is much cheaper and hopefully more accurate.  If it is not I will switch again - bit not to TurboTax.  Screw them!"
"I absolutely love this product. Compared to Kaspersky PURE, the Internet Security 2012 has some very nice features like Cloud protection. I find this function very useful because it allows you to navigate the web through a ""secure line"" through Kaspersky, which means that I can check my bank, credit card and other sensitive information when I am connected through a hotspot.

As usual, the software runs without any significant decrease in processor speed, daily updates and different options for scanning for viruses.
Definitely recommend it."
"GUEST REVIEWER - ! MRS. KNOW IT ALL ;-b

This software upgrades the interface from previous versions---but in a good way, as it is a lot more intuitive.  Basically, allowing me to capture, convert and copy digital media is a BIG plus.  A nice feature for CD burning, is that it will automatically split up large numbers of songs over multiple CDs without the need for you figuring out how many songs you can actually burn on the disc.  So, you can just keep clicking away and it will figure it all out for you---and allow you to create multiple copies all at once.  I found the software to be slow at some times when burning large amounts, but it did get the job done."
"Using this product for years to track finances, easy to convert each year when new product comes out, recommend this product!"
"I continue to love this software. I use it to edit photos, to take screen shots, and to create book covers. I feel it has an easier learning curve than Adobe's Photoshop."
nice product
"I tried this product more out of curiosity than out of a desire to anything in particular with it (I'm not a writer, I'm not continuously typing long documents, and even if I were, my typing is pretty good).  I was fairly impressed at first, just because I've never used speech recognition software before, and it was a delight to see what I was saying (mostly) appearing on screen.

After playing around with it for a while, however, I don't think it would be the kind of software I would want to use regularly to compose documents.  When I'm typing, I watch the screen, and correct nearly all of my errors as they appear.  It's absolute torture for me to go through and proof my work after I've typed it.  Using speech recognition software regularly would force me to do so, since I'm less likely to catch the errors in real time.  Now, proofreading is a good skill to have, and a good habit to be in, but I _hate_ doing it, so anything that would make me have to do so (like a critical boss, or speech recognition software) is something I'm not eager to embrace (I don't actually make a habit of embracing any of my bosses, but that's neither here nor there).

So, if you're lazy like me, you'll be torn between the convenience of keeping your hands in your pockets (or busy ferrying junk food from the bag to your face) while you work, and the inconvenience of proofing your work after it's dictated.  For the diligent, I guess this software would let them dictate documents while doing chin-ups, or something, but that's a lifestyle (diligence, physical fitness) that I don't know much about and can't provide a lot of useful feedback on."
"I was so disappointed when BedBathandBeyond discontinued this product, but I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  It's my favorite fragrance for the summertime!"
Happy husband
seems like  the cover is more interesting than what is inside.. disappointing.. not ready to subscribe again..too much like family circle disappointing but for the cover.. lol.
"This USB hub works just fine, and I love the design.  I have never liked the solidly-built hubs, because when you have several items coming in from different angles/directions, they tend to move the hub around or even damage it. That's never an issue with this design.  Inexpensive and it does what I want - recommended."
"The Sony Movie Studio Suite is a powerful program for video editing novices. You can create awesome home movies without having to be an expert. The package comes with a whole slew of tools if you want to get creative, but the standard set of instructional videos will get you started making your own videos. Final Cut Pro is a much more robust product, but if you are a beginner, this is a good choice."
"Very Good
Thank you"
"Easy to use, reliable and accurate most of the time. Have been using it over 15 years and never had any major problems. A few minor glitches here and there with updates, but overall very good software."
My daughter loves these shoes. Fit true to size.
"I've seen a couple reviews that attempt to compare Naturally Speaking with Microsoft's Speech Recognition Engine (MSRE hereafter); however, the two are not truly comparable in many areas.

Both do share a few common traits:

They work with Microsoft Word, Corel WordPerfect, Notepad and WordPad but neither works with LibreOffice or OpenOffice.
Both can be used to control common computer commands, for writing emails and accessing programs without having to use a mouse.

Beyond these similarities there are glaring differences.  MSRE is built into Windows 7 versions above Starter and doesn't require resources beyond what your computer has.  Dragon recommends at least 2GB RAM for anything below Windows 7 and even states 4GB is more in line with reality.

And that's true.  Attempt to put Dragon on anything with less RAM and certain features may be crippled and, in some cases, Dragon will refuse to install.  In essence, those using netbooks face an uphill battle.

So, does that mean MSRE wins the fight before it begins?  Most definitely not.

I tested both during a 1 month time frame a few months ago for a school project and the end results were glaringly different.

Both require voice training by the user that consists of talking to your computer through a headset (Dragon includes one but MSRE, obviously, doesn't).  Although you might assume your laptop microphone might do the trick, it won't.  You'll have to use a headset with the mic close to your mouth or risk disrupted communications.

MSRE's training is less structured and consists or repeating lines shown on the screen; however, it became apparent that if I made a mistake it would merely print what I was expected to say, not what I actually said.  Dragon's goes more in-depth in the area, will catch your errors and force you to go back to correct the mistake.

Both offer to scan your hard drive for writing examples so profiles can be built but make sure ahead of time it's your writing and not your friend's.  Since emails, documents and various tidbits are scanned it's possible you might get somebody's profile other than your own (especially if emails contain a great deal of abbreviations such as ""lol"" or ""brb"").

Since Dragon makes more of an effort to collect information through the two methods it built the better initial profile.

For example, Dragon easily dictated ""Have a rotten day"" while MSRE printed ""Opium rotten day"".

Not only that, but correcting is a real chore in MSRE.  Dragon merely requires the user to state ""spell that"" as does MSRE, but Dragon has a simpler method.  A box appears and the user can use the keyboard to spell the incorrect word.  MSRE also brings up a box but your have to verbalize every letter.  In my example above I told MSRE to correct Opium but had to verbalize every letter in slow order and even at that it still got it wrong.  Way too much effort.

Dictating a simple letter in MSRE was excruciating compared to Dragon.  Dragon got every word right in a two paragraph letter but MSRE was so full of mistakes it took longer to make corrections than to dictate the stupid thing to begin with.

A prime case in point is the word ""too"".  Invariably you'll get mistakes since spelling can be to, too or two but Dragon uses more common sense.  Dictating ""My name is Pete, too"" in MSRE always returned a spelling of ""to"" whereas Dragon noticed the comma and figured out it meant ""in addition"" thereby requiring ""too"".  Dragon also recognized the use of numbers better although MSRE did fairly well here, too.  ""Two dollars"" in either returned an entry of $2 but dictating ""two apples"" to MSRE could be a mixed bag.  Sometimes it returned ""two apples"" while other times it would print ""to apples"".

Then comes the matter of opening programs via verbal commands.  MSRE does well with Microsoft oriented programs but is really haphazard when it comes to non-MS offerings.

For example, opening WordPad was easy, ""Open WordPad"".  Not a problem there, but opening others could be a trick, especially in the program names were not common words.

I have Ashampoo programs on my PC and to open them with MSRE required the following verbal commands:  1) Start, 2) All Programs, 3) Ashampoo, and 4) Photo Commander.

Conversely, Dragon required one command - ""Open Ashampoo Photo Commander"".

Both did require that I spell out Ashampoo but Dragon took to the spelling immediately while MSRE insisted it be ""A shampoo"" instead of one word.  Still working on that.

Another example is LibreOffice.  True, neither works with this suite as far as dictation is concerned, but at least Dragon would open the program once trained.  MSRE always jammed on it even after I physically spelled the title.  Instead, MSRE would insist I said ""Le Bray"" instead of Libre.

As a final experiment I dictated a 2 page document in both reading from a text I had prepared earlier.  I did so without looking at the screen just to see what the end result would be.  MSRE returned a document so full of errors it wasn't worth going back to make corrections.  While punctuation wasn't a problem, misspelled words galore resulted in a document so full of underlined words it was hard to tell what was correct.

Meanwhile, Dragon did an excellent job with few errors.

So, is Dragon worth the $70 or so to buy this program over what is already offered for free in Windows?

Yes, in more ways than one.  While MSRE may eventually rise to the level of Dragon I don't see that happening anytime soon since it's a side project for Microsoft and a free one at that.  True, MSRE will dictate letters and emails and maybe open a program or two but don't count on it for much more.

So why did I ding Dragon a star?  For a few reasons, actually.

First, it is resource and memory intensive.  Better have RAM aplenty and it does take nearly 3GB out of your hard drive.

Second, registration is an elongated affair that often fails a couple times before finally taking hold.  Don't be surprised if it looks like it has registered when, in fact, it hasn't.  Don't worry, it will keep bugging you until it's complete (appears to be a website issue).

Finally, version 11, which is this version, requires a download update of 512MB or roughly  the size of the original installation.  That requires 30 minutes just to download the update not including another 10 minutes to install it (on top of the 20 minutes it takes to install the initial 2.9GB file)."
was not worth Free
"I have been using McAfee for a lot of years. It is a good solid product. Back in the DOS days Norton Utilities was a godsend, correcting errors before they turned into total system crashes. Then the company was sold and everything they put out was terrible; it caused more problems than it solved. Well all of that has changed. June 2010 issue of Consumer Reports rates Norton Internet Security 2010 as their top rated pick stating, ""It is one of the best products tested for detecting web sites that host malware, and for speed in scanning a hard drive for threats"". I think that about says it all. It's the most effective, and the fastest. What else is there?

I ran speed tests back then when removing McAfee and installing Norton in order to see which one had the longer boot time and once again Norton came out on top. I have not had any problems whatsoever running Norton Internet Security 2010, 2011, Norton 360 for 2012-13, and now Norton 360 2014. The price has come down some since I acquired it. It is good for up to 5 independent devices whether they be laptops, desktops, and now even covers your cell phone. I have a Windows Cell Phone and as is the case for that relative newbie not many programs are written for it including this version of Norton 360. I have seen others reporting that it slows their boot time on their cell phone.

If you are removing McAfee from your machine and you should before installing Norton be sure to not only use the Control panel add remove programs utility but also to Google how to remove it from the web because they have a downloadable utility in order to completely remove it from your system. You never want to install two different antivirus programs on top of one another. However just like when I installed 360 right on top of my 2011 version of Norton and as I suspected it automatically recognized it and did all of the chores for me including removing the old version before installing the new. I also noticed that most of my machines that I installed it in after putting in the activation code/product key it came back as being successfully installed and activated. Only on my main machine that probably received the initial install of Norton back in 2010 when I first started using it did it actually call up the online activation without automatic approval; it required that I log into my Norton account with user name and password in order to activate, but that was the only one. I checked and they all have the subscription of 366 days unless they surprise me in the future requiring a user ID and pass code as well.

I see some users are having issues with Windows 8 and Norton but for Vista and 7 it is solid gold. I have not had one problem or glitch with Norton in the 3+ years I have been using it. All in all highly recommended."
"I have been satisfied by turbotax for many years.  No complaints.  I use this for partnership return, it generates the k1 forms, and pdf files for records as well as e filing.  It does not include the state program, has to be bought separately.  only works on windows, not mac computers."
Was good way back then
"I really hate giving bad reviews because I know I am only one person out of thousands who have tried a product, so someone somewhere must have something nice to say about the product. Not this one.

This software is pretty much like paying $80 for a feature your computer already does. We're not big Mac users in this hose, preferring to stay with Linux, but we do have friends who like to use Mac and clients who need repairs done who run Mac, so we're familiar enough with it.

What really gave this one star was the fact that in order to record HD, you need a separate purchase. And IT CRASHES, EVERY STINKIN' TIME! We haven't gotten this frisbee to do anything besides mess up the computer enough to have to shut it down.

Great concept, but read read read the reviews before you buy! This product is not good."
"I was very happy I was able to choose an Applebee's gift card to send to my dad, he loves their burgers! Thanks Amazon!"
"I don't know how many years it has been, but is has been from the beginning of Intuit.

Yes, there have been problems along the way including a couple so severe I said I'd never use the product again.

But I always come back because TurboTax always does the job and makes it a lot easier  than doing it manually.

I hate all the ads and cross selling and wish they would stop, but there is no hope of that.

They did add back the forms they put into a slightly higher priced version last year and sparked an insurrection.

Overall, it's TurboTax, good old staid and reliable TurboTax.

"Lots of junk food recipes with two sticks of butter and two cups of sugar followed by weight loss product ad or other prescription drugs. I used to find interesting articles about making your own spa products and consumer-type articles on finding great deals. I find some of the articles to be politically correct propaganda. Some of the features are just infomercials on cheap clothes or unnatural ""beauty"" products. I don't enjoy it.  On the other hand, there are some healthy recipes and positive articles about people helping others.  Overall, it is just too commercialized for my taste and I won't be renewing."
"After 6 years of faithful service, my hard drive died a few weeks ago. I bought another Gateway and it was recommended to me that I get Spy Sweeper.

I had never ran any Spy tool up until now, choosing just to use Anti-Virus Software. I had wondered if Spy Sweeper would be redundant.

Well, I have Spy Sweeper 5.0.7.1608 and within the first few days of having my new computer, this software caught 3 incidents of spyware that my Anti-Virus never detected!

This tool sweeps files, registry, cookies...everything. It will quarantine first, and then you can choose to delete it.

My system is FAST, and I've not seen Spy Sweeper act unusually in any way, nor has it taken up too much memory. (I have AMD Athlon, 64 X2 dual core processor 3800+ with 1.87 GB of RAM--running on XP.) I have all 12 recommended shields running at all times.

Spy Sweeper will sweep every week, but you can choose to sweep anytime. Sweeps, for me, have only taken 5-6 minutes.

My experience has been very positive with Spy Sweeper, especially when I saw it catch several spyware that my Anti-Virus *didn't* pick up. Very affordable software for the kind of protection it provides, in my opinion."
"I very much enjoy Cook's Country. The writing comes across as not condescending, the recipes use ingredients that are not out of my price range and that I can find locally, and the price is worth it to me. The magazine is big, glossy, and provides enjoyable reading. I love the history they give on what is featured, the different themes, and especially the details on why an ingredient or technique doesn't work."
"I have not used a speech to text product in some time, the last being Dragon Dictate for Windows from a few years back. This is the first version of Dictate for the Mac that I have used, but the products are similar in how they work.

My goal is to have a way of transcribing voice memos I record with my iPhone. I went through the set up procedure, skipping over the part where it asks you to create a nuance account as part of registration (I guess I will be prompted to do this again later).  For training the software I used a voice recording I made of something I had previously written. It requires 90 seconds of audio to work; I gave it a 2 minute piece. The first pass during the training had a lot of errors which I corrected. The software then translated the voice recording and it still had quite a few errors. I tried again where I made a concerted effort to speak slower and more clearly. This second effort rewarded me with a better translation, but still with errors that I had to edit. I then tried a third time, with a different text, and this further improved, but still with errors.

I then switched gears and tried the voice transcription from a live recording. First I used the included USB microphone. Surprisingly, it worked a bit better, still with errors but fewer. I then tried recording with a bluetooth headset and it worked about as well, so it is the way I will go from now on.

My conclusion is that it is probably unrealistic for me to expect 100% accuracy. If I am focused on good diction and pacing, I can improve accuracy. Using a good audio source with minimal background noise is likely a necessity. The microphone in the iPhone may not be of high enough quality, although I am going to continue to try this route, since it is primarily what I am interested in using the software for. I see potential here, as I have continued to see improvement. I would like for the software to be able to take multiple sample audio files with corrections and use that to improve accuracy. But I think it will continue to improve with time."

"Corel's WordPerfect Office X6 program suite provides a full-featured set of applications for all your office computing needs. It is generally not hard to install, though some systems may have programs installed that interfere, so it's best to close out everything else that is running before starting the installation. If you have X5 and are satisfied then there's not much reason to upgrade - Winzip, the program that began as popular shareware, is an addition to X6 that most people won't really need. WordPerfect Office is compatible with MS Office/Word formats so you can exchange files between the two, and there is similar functionality. Each suite has its strengths and weaknesses depending on the needs of the user. WordPerfect is more affordable since it doesn't have the market dominance that MS Office has. For those really on a tight budget there is the OpenOffice program that can be obtained for free online from Sun MicroSystems. That one handles the basics well but lacks a lot of extra features and options that you can get in the commercial Office suites. For those who are in need of a suite that includes resources for word processing, presentations, spreadsheets, file management, Internet integration, and more, I would recommend considering WP Office X6 - if you have a recent PC model. If your PC is pretty old it might not handle the latest software so well, so you should check the recommended system specs before getting the software. Corel has done a nice job keeping the Word Perfect tradition going strong, as Word Perfect was the 1st word processing application I ever used, back in the MS-DOS era! Things have changed a lot in the last couple decades, while WordPerfect has managed to adapt and continue to serve millions of computer users."
"Maybe it's I've been hardwired into Microsoft Word for so long, but I don't find this program to be all that intuitive. It comes with a crude and inaccurate tutorial that is virtually useless. Fortunately, there are many how-to books on the market, and I have acquired on. The best I can say so far is that this app was relatively inexpensive."
"Very, very, reliable. Used them for years. Never had a virus since I started using their software and their services."
works
"You cant go wrong with Norton.  I had the 360 last year and went with the Norton Security this year.  I have 3 devices that I need to protect which includes a Mobile phone and this product has secured those 3 devices for me.  I can protect up to 5 devices.  My computer was running very slow and would take a while for web pages to load, and the streaming video was atrociously slow.  Once I installed Norton Security and ran the Full system scan, Norton found and fixed several issues, viruses, malware that I had on my system.  Now the video streaming is back to normal and my computer isn't slow anymore.  Its like I have a brand new computer all for the purchase of this software.  When in doubt, go with Norton for your security needs."
Very little space.....most are giving 25GB free...... Way to small.
"I actually decided to upgrade because my school offered Windows 8 for free.  That was a mistake.  I'm not sure what the software developers were smoking when they developed this, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that a tablet interface is usually best when it's used on a tablet.  When you try to bolt it onto a desktop like ketchup on ice cream and force everyone to use it as an additional obsticle to their work, you're bound to run into problems.

The security hype is completely overblown.  When I say overblown, I mean that whoever told you that this OS is secure is either incompetent or lying.  I had just cleaned out a bunch of junk spyware from Windows 7 before I upgraded.  Once the upgrade was complete, literally within seconds both Internet Explorer and Firefox were hijacked by an intrusive malware program that changed my home page and a bunch of my registry settings.  All efforts to fix my browser were repulsed.  The virus had managed to not only crawl into my computer without being noticed, but modify my registry settings so Windows had no idea it was being secretly installed on my computer.  No annoying pop-up that says ""Are you sure you want to install?""  On a side note, I have declared that annoying feature completely useless.  Thank goodness Chrome is more secure.

To make things worse, there is poor backwards compatibility...even though the desktop uses the exact same engine as Vista and Windows 8.  It's aparrently so bad that my sophisticated anti-virus never saw the virus even though it says 2013.  I had six spyware programs all scanning my computer at the same time.  None of them could find it either.  Finally, I was forced to completely erase Windows and do a fresh install.  Funny though...I do a spyware scan at least once a day.  Every time I do, it catches about 200+ suspicious cookies.

My advice to anyone who is thinking of upgrading from Windows 7...DON'T!  For anyone thinking about upgrading from Vista...DON'T...upgrade to Windows 7.  For those of you still running XP...save yourself $600 and install Ubuntu Linux for free.  You'll get another 4 years out of your computer.  As for me, I'm going to enjoy using Windows 7."
"Currently (as of Feb. 2014), Susan Spencer is the editor. This is a great improvement over Elizabeth Mayhew, who took over as editor for Jane Chesnutt and served in that role from 2010 to 2012. Although I like the new editor much better than Mayhew, this magazine still isn't as compelling as it once was (pre-2010).

There are some decorating articles which are always my favorite, as well as lots of recipes, a few health-related articles, at least one article on clothing / outfits, and usually a few life stories (human interest stories). Over all, this article is a quick-read - you can get through the entire magazine in one sitting in about half an hour. I think the target demographic for this magazine might be women ages 35 to 65 years old. For example, there is usually at least one article related to coping with senior parents.

While this is not a bad magazine, you may be better served by subscribing to a magazine that more closely matches your specific interests and hobbies."
"typical Quicken, you get to redo this every THREE years"
"Got Windows 8/8.1 for my laptop.  This OS is really designed from the bottom up for a phone/tablet.  The user interface is very much touch screen oriented.  At least with 8.1 it now boots to the desktop  instead of the tiled start screen.  Media player is gone, unless you buy the pro version or pay extra bucks to purchase it separately.  My wife's biggest complaint is that you can not play any of the games unless you are logged on to the Internet.  Even single player games like Solitare will not run unless you have an Internet connection.  Guess I'll wait and see what Windows 9 looks like before updating my desktop computers.  (If I wanted a tablet OS, I would stick with Android based.  It is SO much faster than Windows 8)."
"I was perfectly happy with Quicken 2012 but when I saw that 2013 had an iPad app I had to take the plunge. Throughout my day, I spend a lot of pocket cash that I often forget about, and the idea of being able to enter transactions directly on my iPad and then sync them when I got home was *very* appealing to me since I'd often end a month with a few hundred dollars in ""pocket cash"" when my wallet only had $20 in it.

However, the cloud experience just flat out does not work. I added all of my accounts, but when I log into the iPad App it tells me to go to my computer and add the accounts. I've tried cloud sync several times. After about 5 minutes, a window pops up that ""Quicken has stopped responding"" with options to close the program or continue waiting. I picked ""Continue"" then took my dogs for a walk, only to return 20 minutes later to the same message and I have a *VERY* fast Internet connection (it took about 1 minute to download the Quicken program itself).

After doing some research on the web, I saw that a lot of users were not only having trouble with the iPad app, but were LOSING DATA. This thought terrifies me, so I temporarily turned off cloud sync.

As for the rest of the app, nothing really new and exciting. It does what Quicken is supposed to do.

I'm giving it two stars because the basic app itself is functional, but I feel Intuit has really misled the consumer into upgrading with the idea of a cloud-based iPad app when this app isn't working properly."
"Having owned a PC years and years ago, I remembered needing antivirus and anti-malware products, and when I scanned my PC, a million things always popped up. I installed this in a few short minutes, scanned my MacBook Pro (took a long time, as these things often do), and nothing came up. That made me think this whole process was a little unnecessary.
Then I noticed my computer appeared to slow down when using the internet. I'm still not sure if I'm imagining it, but I can't help but wonder if I should un-install it after a few pages that used to work fine have been acting odd lately.
Also, I noticed there doesn't appear to be an anti spyware or malware scan available. Maybe the comprehensive scan covers this? If so, I find it hard to believe I haven't picked up a single thing after almost 3 years with this Mac. Either way, it makes this product superfluous: either Macs really are quite resistant to this stuff, or this software isn't finding anything.

Perhaps this is better for other platforms and products, but if you have a Mac laptop of any kind, I can tell you I've gone without this sort of thing since 2005 without issues, and I can also say this only appears to be slowing down my Internet. Not a lot, but enough to make me wonder why I still have this installed. I'll keep it running and update, if needed.
Thanks for reading!"
this one is a good defrag and i like it alot
"I love it
 Clean fresh smell, non irritating to my scalp.."
"I have been using a different editing program but decided to try Paint Shop Pro X2.  It was a good decision.  I still have a lot to learn about the program, but many, many tutorials are available on the internet and they are extremely helpful.  A manual comes with the CD, but it is more of a summary than a ""how to"", guide.  For the latter, I prefer the tutorials on the internet.

I also purchased Photo Shop Elements at the same time, but find myself spending more time with Paint Shop Pro.

Actually, no editing program has it all, accept possibly the very expensive version of Photo Shop.  But that is beyond my financial capabilities.  Meantime, I am doing very well with Paint Shop Pro as my primary editing tool and Elements and my previous program when the things they do especially well are needed."
"Love these, comfortable, light weight, great fit."
"One of the biggest sins Microsoft committed with her Office XP Application Suite is removing the Publisher from its Professional edition without lowering the price. (The Professional edition of Office 2000 has Publisher, in addition to all other Applications present in XP Professional). But that apart, I must say that this Publisher 2002 works fine. It is fast, very easy to customize, and yields high quality Desktop Publishing outputs. Still, a close scrutiny revealed that its 'improvements' over the 2000 edition is only marginal. The difference between the two is mainly on the interface. Hence, I regard this 2002 edition as a great value for anyone upgrading a 9X version; but not for the 2000 one."
"I have had McAfee installed on my 5 computers for several years.  Seems to work well.
My biggest complaint is that I get short notice when the license will expire (after a year),  and to keep protected McAfee wants me to renew online for 3 times the cost of buying through Amazon.  So try to remember to buy the new version a month before the old one expires.  Also,  getting last years version seems to work as well (but cheaper) than getting this years version."
"Each on my (3) networked systems is regularly used by (3) grandchildren age 14, 10, & 8.  Prior to installing Kaspersky I regularly had to clean my systems of malware and viruses resulting from enthusiastic clicks on any link that appeared on the screen.  One of the systems always had some issue.

In 2011 I switched to  Kaspersky Internet Security on each PC and the problems stopped.  This year I installed Kaspersky Pure on each system and have experienced zero problems.  There have been many warnings and much whining about restricted access to several popular web sites or but there have been no issues  - NONE!

I realize my review does not address technical issues  addressing CPU %, system resources, etc (ad nauseum).  In a real world, Kaspersky delivers results.  What a concept!"
what can i say?
I have been wearing this fragrance for years and the body cream luxurios. In fact I wear it alone for a longer lasting and subtle effect.
Worked!
My grandson loved it.
Great purchase.
"Willmaker Plus was exactly what my family and I needed to prepare for an unexpected death.  It took you step by step and for anyone who has used a tax prep program will find the format similar.  It asks you questions to see what is pertinent to your situation and prompts you for the information that you need.  What was really helpful was that you could stop and save and pick it up at a later date.  This was nice since I didn't have all of the info I needed at my fingertips so I was able to get that, then pick up where I left off.

Even if you have more complex arrangements to make, especially in the case of divorce I think you will find that Willmaker Plus will cover you needs.  One thing that we needed was a promissory note in addition to just a will and I was sooo happy that that option was also included into this program as well.  It covered everything that we needed and make a not so pleasant task easy.  I highly recommend it.  It installed easily, and was easy to use.  I would buy it again without any hesitation!"
"Unlike Vista, Windows 7 is a very good operating system. It is stable and inherits the familiar functions that existed in previous versions. Another plus is the incorporation of a built-in encrypting utility to protect work files and entire partitions. However, to buy Windows 7 Professional for this feature is not justifiable. The open source program TrueCrypt does a better job, and it is free.
.
Unfortunately, this operating system is not perfect. I do experience freezing of the screen, disappearance of the cursor, and the inability to install programs. A hard reboot will often make these problems go away.
.
In the end, buy Windows 7 Home Premium. The only reason for buying the higher price Professional is mute. The built-in encryption utility can be duplicated by a freeware, TrueCrypt."
"Avanquest is one of the worst software companies I have ever encountered. They sell buggy software, refuse to acknowledge any problems, they will ignore your letters and then want you to pay for upgrades. I got conned by their hype and bought a couple of their products. By the time I realized how buggy the software was, it was too late to return them. Then I get an email which essentially said I could buy a new version that might fix the bugs. Why should I have to pay for something to fix the bugs? I emailed them repeatedly and they did a great job of ignoring me and repeatedly asking what the problem was, I then realized they were just laughing at me."
"I've been trying to use this suite of applications for a while now, comparing it to my favorite suite, Roxio Creator, and I haven't had much luck.  I think the problem is I am looking for features that the application just doesn't have?  It's also not very stable and I can tell you that it's not my system.  I built my system myself and it's fully loaded with a Phenom II triple-core processor, 4GB of RAM, Windows 7 and all the bell and whistles lovingly maintained by myself.  Yet, this hangs/crashes most of the time I try to use it.

First, starting with the photo suite.  I had a really hard time figuring out how to get my photos imported into this program.  Why can't it just use the Windows 7 libraries I'd already set up?  Same for videos?  I didn't find there was a whole lot I could do with the photos once I got them up and running (after several crashes -- maybe it doesn't like they are all on my home server on the network?).  Microsoft Live Essentials is free and it works much better and I can do a lot more with it.

Second, starting with the video suite.  I never really got this working.  It just kept crashing trying to load in movies.  I can load in the same movies into Roxio and Windows Movie Maker.  I had to give up.  I really wanted to test the editing features here.

Third, DVD/CD burning.  I wanted to burn an ISO to a DVD so I could install Ubuntu on a new system.  I never found the option for doing so.  Is there one?  I had to use Roxio instead.  I never got around to trying to take some home movies and make a DVD out of it.  Again, crashing/hanging.

Finally, WinDVD.  I'd heard all kind of good things about WinDVD, especially the Bluray support.  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work with Bluray?  Maybe it does and I haven't figured it out?  Nothing seems to be intuitive here or it's so simple the features just don't exist?  Windows Media Center comes with Windows 7 and it can play DVDs.

So, now it's been installed for quite a while on my PC and I never use it.  I always go to Microsoft Live Essentials or Roxio Creator for what I need.  Eventually I will get around to installing it.

I've been agonizing over writing this review for a long time but this has been my experience.  It seems others have found what they are looking for/expecting but I have not.  I found the functionality limiting and it crashed/hung a lot on my PC."
Always used Turbo Tax and now I bought H&R Block.  It is great and I like it better than Turbo tax.
"I have used many different video editing programs over the years including APE and the previous version of this program and after trying this out for a few weeks, I declare this to be the best I have ever used!
Fast at rendering? you bet it is! and has a whole host of features that I love, yet some I do not use or maybe am not yet ready for (3D)

I installed it and right away assembled video I shot with two different cameras at a recent wedding. I used the easy editor to create my first clip, I chose a theme, added my clips and I was stunned to see the results....an impressive fast-rendered 20 minute movie with impressive special effects. (Friends congratulated me on my work lol)
I also used the same clips to make a straightforward movie with titles and transitions, it rendered very fast and the quality of the finished product was impressive.
My only issue initially was choosing the right file type to create but now I have the hang of it it is a breeze

Pros
Very easy to use
easy mode makes movie creating ridiculously easy!
Super fast rendering
Excellent quality of the final product
An insane amount of features.
Lots of tutorial videos on their web-site
Not one freeze or crash..yippee!

Cons
The only con was when I tried to initially choose an output file but I got the hang of it.

I have to say, I have used Adobe Premier Elements for many years and always considered that the best...but no longer, Power Director Ultra 10 has really impressed me and I will be uninstalling APE because I no longer see any need for it!
If you need video editing software and are new to video editing don't let the vast array of features scare you off, just use easy mode until you get the hang of it. Maybe they should call it ""Super Easy Mode"" because that is what it really is.
I am so impressed, really! An amazing piece of software!"
"This was my first experience with Anime Studio software. Most of my animation experience with low key - using rudimentary type programming. While I am sure this program had the best of intentions, it is really not for the beginner. To get things to happen takes a lot of effort as things just aren't set up intuitively. Even the tutorial seemed to start in the middle of the program. It didn't start by explaining what terms meant, what was the purpose behind the features, etc. While I understand this software is often used by people who are really good at animation - there is a ""beginner mode"" and it never really treated me like a beginner.
I was also disappointed that you are immediately thrown into needed to ""upgrade"" to get creations to do the really neat things shown on the package. The start-up page presents you with options to buy additional characters. The developers should maybe take a lesson from Ap developers - first reel your customers in, then hit them with a desire to upgrade. Don't brag upfront about how I am going to need to spend more money to do the really ""cool"" stuff.
I just couldn't in confidence recommend this software to anyone. I definitely wouldn't recommend it for the novice or beginner. And, I am too green with the software to know if it is the right fit for those who are much more advanced in Animation. The software just doesn't seem to know quite who it is targeting.
I gave this software a lot of time to see if it would grow on me or if I would have an ""a ha"" moment and it just never happened.
I guess the good things I can say about it was that it installed easily and you can get started within minutes. However, getting started is too strong of a word for my experience. It was more like - look through a tutorial and get stuck at the fourth page. Then, spend a long time try to make something cool happen only to never accomplish anything beyond changing some colors. I also didn't like that the software was constantly pushing me to download more content (free and paid). I was still trying to figure out the home page and I kept getting prodded to do more. Every time I tried to really work with this software I ended up frustrated."
"I have used just about every product on the market from obscure to wildly popular. We've had the least problems with ANYTHING since converting to Kaspersky and we keep going back to it.

The biggest difference we noticed is less ""stuff"" running in the background and slowing down the computer.

Installing is about the same as any software. It just takes a little time and you follow the prompts.

Love Kaspersky and recommend them to everyone."
"love it ,thank you !"
"I purchased this through newegg and it is a complete joke on explaniing lump sum distribution for social security lump sum distributions from previous year and 3rd party insurance disabilty. ,.It was very frustrating and feel like we wasted 75.00 as we will just take it all to a tax service now."
"IMO its extremely!! Hard to navigate with no clear answers in the Help menu/ how to.
IMO if you have lots of time to experiment through trial & arrow it may be a good program but not for a novice."
"I purchased Kaspersky Internet Security 7.0 (3-user) so I could load it in my computer and my daughter's laptops. This software is very protective of my system. It has so many settings; I could see where it might be a little difficult for people not completely computer literate to figure out how to utilize its full potential. This software protects you in every area, from being on the internet to scanning your emails before you open them. It can become a little annoring if the settings are set too high. But once you get the hang of it, you'll be so glad you bought it. I guess most importantly, it gives you real piece of mind that your system is protected fully.
It will not slow your system down. And it does not take over your computer like many of the other brands. And Amazon performs great as usual. I've been a member of Prime since it's beginning and never had anything but great things to say about the service I have received."
"Very Interesting.  Discover articles are always informative, and alwys worth the time to read, and keep for future reference.
I always keep back issues."
love this product! ran out of face wash on a trip once so I used this and have used it as face wash ever since!
"So, this is my first time with corel and the painter line of products and I must say it worked perfectly as I had hoped. I use a graphic pad and draw art in a non digital way -- I set an undercolor and try to design something as if it were fine art.

The images I made seemed almost as if I had done them directly on a canvas. The choices of brush types helped to ease this process even further. This was all further simplified with how easy it is to access different tools with shortcut keys and how my graphic pad quickly was recognized and used by the software.

Definitely worth the money in my eyes but as someone who has not used other graphic software or the previous versions I don't know what has changed or what is better. As an artist though I enjoy this product."
"Turbo Tax does a good job for us. FWIW, you should study those areas of the tax law that affect you. By so doing, you will be able to vet the results of Turbo Tax rather proceeding on blind faith."
"I have always used Norton but the 2012 edition messed up my system from the start.  Then Internet Explorer started running very slowly and links would not work.  After nearly 2 weeks of email tech support and 7 hours on the phone with Norton, their final solution was that since the problem was with Internet Explorer, I had to contact Microsoft.  I called Microsoft and they downloaded a program called SuperSpyWare Professional trial version and it immediately found that the computer was infected by 2 trojans.  These infected my system while Norton was running and supposedly protecting it.  Also, Norton scans had just come up fine.  As soon as these 2 trojans were removed, all the problems with the computer were gone.  I now know I CAN NO LONGER TRUST NORTON TO PROTECT MY COMPUTER.  Microsoft recommended Kaspersky which is what I intend to replace Norton with.  I will never use a Norton product again as it does not do what it is supposed to do."
"I installed the Bitdefender Internet Security 2010 in May 2010 to replace the expired Zone Alarm Internet Security Suite in the guestroom computer.  Installation was fast and painless.  A Configuration Wizard provides easy selection for different usage types: Typical, Parent, Gamer, or Custom.  There are three User Interfaces to choose from: Novice, Intermediate, and Expert.  I started with Typical/Intermediate UI and later switched to Parent/Expert UI for more advanced settings.  Because I skipped the initial full system scan, a warning window kept prompting to send an error message to Bitdefender.  This was resolved after system was fully scanned.  The boot up, update, and scan times are faster than ZA.  All the critical protective feature are there: AV, firewall, Wi-Fi management, Antispan, Anti-phishing, Anti-rootkit, Parental Control, IM encryption, Vulnerability scan, Anti-malware, etc.  Expert users can fine tune the settings to their specifications.  What I really like about Bitdefender is its speed, efficiency, low usage of system resources, wide range of protective features, a reported 98.9% detection rate, and a silent mode 52% Proactive detection, and good technical support.  As of July, 2010: so far, so good but one can never be too careful in regards to internet security.  Recommended."
"Everyone has a need for a nail brush. On the top of the unit, you get a tight row of curved bristles, which are great for getting under your nails. The bottom is all brush and you can use it to remove dead skin and overgrown cuticles. Works best wet and with soap. It is easy to hold. After using, you will want to let it air dry and keep it away from water and steam when you are not using, I say this because I have had to throw more than one bristled brush away because they get mildew when you leave them in a shower."
"This is by far the best self-guided foreign language product on the market that I have used.  I highly recommend it, it makes learning a foreign language much easier, and it is very intuitive to use."
This treatment is awesome to reinforce your hair and make it look shinny and healthy. I def recommend it for everybody.
"My only experience in editing video in the past has been working with Windows Movie Maker and pulling over HDV from tape.  Now that I'm using a Canon DSLR for most of my video clips, I picked up the Corel videostudio to add more control and features to my video editing.  I'm running it on a Windows 8.1 i5 laptop without issue.  I imagine that it works well on Windows 7, but really speeds along without issue.  Most of my video editing is archival, cleaning up clips of my kids and labeling them.  But for birthdays, its fun to put a video and picture collage together of the last year to reminisce on the happiness and fun times.  The kids love that.

The tools initially appear pretty daunting with the cryptic buttons and a lot of tools packed into the screens.  I went through a few tutorials to get my bearings, and now am enjoying working with my video, filters, effects, and sound clips.  I really can't rate this against the expensive professional packages, but for a casual video editor that I need, it works well.  I like that it has common outputs for facebook, youtube, etc so that posting up is simplified.  This is what I needed - if you aren't sure you can always go to the corel site and download a trial edition and it has all of the same features."
Everything just as promised
Gave to someone for a birthday gift. they loved it. Happy with my purchase
"Avast makes a great free product! In December I needed antivirus protection for a Win XP machine when my Norton Security subscription ended. I used another product for my Windows 7 machines, but spotted this free version and it's perfect for this use. As a matter of fact, I am so impressed with it I will definitely evaluate the paid versions when my other service subscription expires.

It seems to function well, doesn't take up a lot of resources and the offers to upgrade or add features are entirely reasonable and don't interfere with the operation or get in your way. This is how to win customers from a free version!"
I have used this for years and absolutely love it.  Can't wait for it to be made available again as I am getting very low.
Perfect for kids homework. All four programs are necessary for everyday use.
"Caution: You should care about stealth marketing and wrong reviews.

Generally, Windows 10 is the worst operating system. Windows 10 is inferior to Windows 7. So, Windows 10 is useless in the world. We must not use Windows 10 forever.

You may have one question. [Why is Windows 10 inferior to Windows 7?] Actually, Microsoft wants to unite some OSs to one OS. Some OSs include laptop PC, desktop PC, TV game, mobile phone. It can realize that Microsoft create OS with lower cost. But, it has some problems. [Some hardware with high performance] must fit lower performance hardware. Therefore, Windows 10 makes desktop PC inferior than Windows 7.

Additionally, Windows 10 has worse functions than Windows 7. Lower security, lower flexibility, and lower option. For example, Windows 10 cannot select security programs. Although Windows 7 can select updated programs in a list of downloadable security software.

Finally, Windows 10 has many malfunctions. For example, [many computers with Windows 7] were upgraded to Windows 10 forcibly, and were crashed. Moreover, certain update software (called Windows 10 anniversary update) has broken many computers.

Conclusion: We must not use Windows 10 forever."
"PC Tools Spyware Doctor 2009 v6.0 is incredibly straightforward and easy to operate.  Once the software was installed, I could use program right away, rather than having to comb through a lengthly manual.
After running the program, it discovered many bugs that other programs that I have used missed.
I especially like the real-time feature.  I feel much more comfortable knowing that my computer is safe at all times.
I highly recommend this program and am sure that others will find it easy and thorough."
"This is my first experience using the Corel Painter program. I am a novice when it comes to using video and photography editing software, though I enjoy learning new things like this and hope to develop my skills enough that one day I'll be posting more videos and photos with my amazon reviews!

This product is easy to install and installs fairly quickly. Once installed, it was pretty easy to grab photos from my files stored on the computer and import them into the software to begin tinkering with them. I also have Photoshop Elements installed on my computer, and though there are clearly some similarities between the two, both offer features that the other does not. I probably enjoy using the various filters from both programs the most. The filters can give some dramatic changes to ordinary photos and make you look a lot more skilled that you really are.

I found this product to be quite a bit more limited in what it could do compared to my Photoshop Elements program. I noticed a few other reviewers claiming that this product seemed to lack features or capabilities that were a part of previous versions of the product, but I really can't speak to that, as this is my first outing with it. Like any new software, I'm sure the more time you spend with it the more you can get out of it. I'm hoping this program will be useful to my junior high and senior high students who often have projects to do in their classes.

Though not as robust as Photoshop, I still think this is a decent program that gives you some fun options for dressing up your photos or other images."
"""How to Make a Baby Without Loosing Your Guy"", ""My Father the Fraudster"", ""I Was a High Functioning Alcoholic"" are only a few of the disturbing titles from the July edition of Marie Claire, a (fashion?) magazine about 40% devoted to advertisements. The articles behind the titles are something an intern might have scribbled on her ciggie break from a more serious assignement (such as a coffee run). As for the few ""fashion"" layouts: July magazine received in June, with fashions for the fall (which, in my climate, does not start until Nov/December)...

Still, some of the photographs may eventually prove to be worth the five bucks I paid for a year's subscription...Oh, how sad..."
"Great idea.  Items arrived ahead of schedule.

Great look"
Peachtree accounting became known as Sage not too long ago. Peachtree has been a trusted name in accounting software for decades. I first used Peachtree software in the mid 90's for payroll purposes at a company I worked for at the time. I am primarily a Quickbooks user but I wanted to give Sage a shot. it is definitely a solid product and it seems like a well-planned out piece of software and I could certainly see myself using it on a daily basis.
"Warning: This is the opinion of a novice. If you're looking for advice for professional products, please look elsewhere!

This was not a horrible program in my opinion, but it was discontinued almost immediately after release, is no longer for sale, and is no longer supported.

If you see a copy at a garage sale for a buck or something like that, I say pick it up and give it a spin.

The layout is fairly quirky (almost feels like Windows 95 software) but it does indeed have a lot of quick & dirty features which worked out great for an novice like me. We used it for landscaping sketches & home remodeling sketches. It's much faster to load than online programs, with fast & intuitive ""freestyle"" shape tools.

Alas, I'm giving it a 1-star because it's so reprehensible for a company to release & dump a product like this.

"I've used this tax software for 4 years now and it continues to meet my tax filing needs at a fair price.  I too ran into the install snag that H&R block customer support seemed unable to help me with.  After pressing them harder, I did find a solution that worked, but was more complicated than the suggestions listed here.  They basically had me copy the CD to my desktop, then ""run as administrator"" when it appears you can do it right from the CD.

E-filing is straightforward and I received my return promptly.  Will use again next year."
"I walked away from Symantec products three years ago and have been very  pleased with the the performance of Trend Micro's products. PC-Cillin 2007 is no exception.  In addition, Trend Micro offers a complete Internet Security Suite and in my mind is a superior product in many aspects, i.e. less demanding on system resources, faster startups and shutdowns, more compatible with other applications including Windows updates, superior remote administration capabilities and of course free technical support. I not only run PC-Cillin at home but also use Trend Micro Client-Server SMB at fifteen franchise small business locations with the same great performance at forty percent of the life cycle cost of Norton Corporate Security. Need I say more!"
"I've used TurboTax for over 20 years, have never been audited and wouldn't use any other tax software.  If you're wondering what to do, just buy it and you won't be sorry.  It's accurate and simple to use."
This product works as stated but when I downloaded it it did not do a great job editing existing PDF files.  There needs to be a program created to edit existing PDF's quickly and easily.
Used Taxcut - now HR Block and HR Block for many years and always saved lots of time looking up forms and figuring what was needed. Easy to use and latest rules included. HR Block software is a winner but hope we get a flat tax or fair tax scheme in the USA.
Great for work

"I've been using the Quicken WillMaker Plus software since 2011. It has changed very little since that time, but each year (as with most popular software) it is updated and a new version is put on the market. Older versions came with a book from Nolo explaining various legal terms and information about living trusts. The current 2016 version offers online access to the living trust software for free for 1 year, but that implies a subscription thereafter, however the cost of that access is unclear.

I purchased this, the newest version, more as a curiosity than a need. Having used both the 2011 and 2013 versions - neither is supported by Nolo anymore thus current legal changes (which may or may not be the case for your state) don't show up on the forms in the software. There's no way to tell if your state will have any changes to specific forms for years to come, thus using older versions of this software is probably OK - but there's no real way to know.

This software can be installed via CD or by going to a download site (with the code in the box) and installing it following the download to your computer. Easy to do, and it automatically updates the software upon installation.

NOTE:  If you need to re-install the program, you can again download it and re-input your activation code or use the CD.  See photo for what comes in the box.

-----------------------------------------

RE: OLDER VERSIONS

If you are considering saving money by purchasing and older version of this software, just be aware your state may have some forms that have been updated and those updates won't be visible to you if updates are not supported.

I currently use the 2013 version - updated from the 2011 version - and noticed no real difference in the two for my state. No updates to the forms took place in those two years. I could add both programs to multiple computers without an issue (Windows 7 and 8 PCs) and it could be used by multiple users. The information inputted into one program was imported by the updated version and thus I only had to put in the info one time.

One thing that will happen with older versions though is that when you go to do the 'Web Update' in the software, you will receive a message stating that that version is no longer supported by WillMaker.

When I receive that message I click out of it and an update starts, but the update is only for the year of the software. For example in the 2013 version, the only updates the software received was for the year 2013. Legal changes to forms for other years did not show up.

Frankly, it's just a ploy to keep you buying the updated software - and the combination of the update and an Amazon Lightning Deal got me again. (Twenty-seven bucks was a small price to pay for this one.) **Not showing up as a 'verified purchase', despite having been purchased on Amazon. *

----------------------------------------

WHY YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THIS SOFTWARE

Overall this is a great DIY-kit for those who don't have the money to pay attorneys for these services, but truly it's much more than that because it includes so many useful forms and can be used by several people. The interview format makes filling out the forms easy to do, and there's room to customize if desired. The resulting documents are legally binding, but in most cases do need signatures with witnesses to make it so.

If you have elderly parents, if you have children, if you have assets you want specifically dealt with in a certain way... this software is a cheap investment in protecting them all.

If you already have a Living Trust or a Will, and don't need all the forms (listed below), you can skip getting it, but I suspect if you're reading this review - you're not one of those people. Truly, it's worth the money and peace of mind.

-----------------------------------

ABOUT THE CURRENT VERSION:

"I've been using Norton Internet Security for many years now. While still being a good antivirus/anti malware choice, the newer version(s) seem to use much more system resources and run quite a bit slower. Also, the new (separate cloud) Identity Safe module is not well executed and is ""buggy"" in operation. It may lose password information which is impossible to recover even with Symantec support.

For less than $20.00, this is okay for renewal but, I would recommend other choices, even free antivirus, as a new computer/device install."
"Washes nicely, but the fragrance (seaweed) I find less than pleasing.
That was my review when I first got this product. Now I love the fragrance and absolutely love what it does. It leaves my skin soft, rinses clean, and takes the soreness out of my muscles. I bought this bottle for my sister!"
"Vista is absolute junk. Don't waste your money. If you are running XP, keep it. Don't let mad Doctor FrankenGates of Microjunk Corp mess with your mind. Vista is slow, full of bugs, unstable and has imposible customer service. Do yourself a favor.
Stick with XP or buy a Mac. End of story."
Corel PaintShop Photo Express 2010 is  very basic program that wasn't what I thought it was.  It doesn't provide the user with enough tools to edit photos the way I had hoped.
Worked as advertised.
"You've heard of employees losing a laptop with 100,000 clients' credit card information, or 500,000 social security numbers?  We don't want to be one of those companies.  We work in Russia, US, England, and elsewhere, and can't afford to put clients' information at risk of a public breach.  That's why we use McAfee Anti-Theft"

"great idea best price by far , works perfectly"
"I read alot of good reviews on Kaspersky, I was confident. I used it since 2006. It was a horrible experience, but not expensive to buy, but alot of head hacked.

I don't like the way Kaspersky turned into, they don't update their software anymore, they push push publicity everywhere, they lower their price.

Kaspersky is the new Norton Antivirus. Kaspersky is in every hacker sight, ready to shoot.

I have several problems recuring. After a frustrating weak, I uninstalled it.
I installed Bit defender, right at installation it scan the computer, kasper dose not do that. It just install itselve, then later you have problems, and you have to reinstall.
After the scan it found 14, what 14 treats. I din't believed it.
After the install, a update. Hey, my pc is running smooth. All week long with kaspersky my mouse was freezing, computer freeze completly... not anymore.

Also it's 2 years of protection."
Ordered half a size larger than my usual shoe size and fits perfectly.
"This is a pretty cool interactive Spanish immersion course that is much cheaper than Rosetta Stone. It comes with a CD for your computer, a DVD for your TV and  a MP3 for listening. There are ""people"" who speak it for you and you can repeat it until you understand and speak the words.  There is a lot in this package.. much more than I can tell you about. You can pick and choose where you want to start or go, which is nice. But the best thing about it is the price. This provides you with three levels of learning to speak Latin American Spanish. I'm not sure I'll be visiting Mexico or South America soon but it will help me understand what is being said here in America by Spanish speaking people."
it was great to have it e-mailed to u. Instead of waiting for it in the mail. i've brought alot of gift cards through amazon and always had them sent by mail. Great way to do it. thank u
"I've used a few different versions of Pinnacle Studio and have had the same experience with all of them. It has great tools and some nice extras (audio tracks, etc), but I've never found the interface to be particularly user-friendly. Once you get used to it, you can put together some great, professional-quality videos. It's just the getting used to it part that is frustrating. The help files aren't all that helpful when you are just starting out. For the money, however, this is really the best out there. It does everything you need, even if it is a bit tedious trying to figure out how to do those things. It also supports most major audio and video formats."
"I have been running this security software on my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HTC-EVO-V-4G-Prepaid-Android-Phone-Virgin-Mobile/dp/B008BAU14Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HTC EVO V 4G Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile)</a>&nbsp;for 2 months now.  I haven't noticed any slow down of my phone - which is my main concern with any security software.  So I'm very happy there.  I keep most of the features on all the time - like phishing protection and standard anti-virus protection - and they seem to be doing their job.  Never had a hack or virus yet.

The coolest parts of this software are all the protection features if you lose your phone.  I had a blast playing around with the remotely turned on camera, the GPS locator, and ""the scream"" alarm which has your lost phone blast out a very loud sound so that you can find it.  All of these are featured are accessed from your PC or Mac computer.  Just turn them on and they go to work to help you find your phone if you left it at work or it fell under the seat in your car.

I'll be sure to install the next version of Norton 360 on my next phone.  I like it that much.

As for PC or Mac installation - I have the software installed on my PC so that I can run the features on my Android, but I'm using&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/McAfee-Security-AAI13EMB1RAA-All-Access-2013-Individual-Complete-package-1-year-1-user-mini-box-Win-Mac-BlackBerry-OS-Android-English/dp/B00AC836F6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">McAfee Security AAI13EMB1RAA All Access 2013 Individual - Complete package ( 1 year ) - 1 user ( mini-box ) - Win, Mac, BlackBerry OS, Android - English</a>&nbsp;for the virus and security protection on those.

"I'm a constant user of both office 2003 and office 2007 since I have the 2007 edition at work but have not upgraded at home. Those who are ripping this software as 'terrible' or 'unusable' as being overly harsh. Does it have some frustrating issues? Sure. Is it worthless and unusable? Not at all.

Word, which is the application I spent about half my work hours using, is in many cases easier to use in the 2007 version. While I'm not a huge fan of the ribbon, I don't have issues locating what I need nor do I have problems customizing it to include the features I use most often. Overall I can find exactly what I need when I need it. I think most of the complaints that I read about the ribbon have more to do with users unable to adapt than with a real design flaw inherent to the system of organization. The new DocX file format creates smaller file sizes than the old standard, but at the expense of versatility, as un-patched versions of Microsoft Word will not open them.

Excel is fantastic. The 2007 version is impressively fast compared to 2003. I can use tilt tables with 200 variables without a second delay. Also, the ability to create very high quality charts and graphs that seamlessly integrate with Power Point and Word is fantastic. I've been able to make nicer looking reports in less time than ever before. Excel is the biggest overall improvement from 2003 especially in the visual department. The addition of a wide variety of visual styles for reports is welcome and very useful.

Another great change to Excel is the detailed descriptions for each command that are available in the help section. There is still some streamlining that is missing; too much of the program is still dependent on old macro commands that no one but long time users of things like Lotus Notes have a vocabulary for.

Power Point is also a nice improvement. Adding images and then tweaking them is easier than ever. As I mentioned previously, taking charts and graphs from Excel to PP is very easy. You can use cut-and-paste, or import them directly. The resulting PP files are also smaller than the previous format, which is great for e-mailing them to people.

The much maligned DocX format was initially a real gaffe for Microsoft; not making it immediately usable by Office 2003 users was simply moronic. Although they've released several patches that do allow full implementation between 2003 and 2007 versions of Office, these updates are large (over 50mb) and while businesses most certainly have updated, it's far less likely that your friend, brother, etc., has. Sending a DocX file to those without the patch can create a bit of chaos.

Overall Office 2007 is an improvement over 2003, even if you hate the ribbon. The speed increases, added features, and integration of excel, word, and PP in a way that lets them all play together nicely is well worth the upgrade."
I get this every year for my husband for his birthday. He still loves it and reads it cover to cover and sometimes even get clever ideas from it for our boy scouts.
"At last a fitness magazine for real people.  I love how this magazine covers many different topics, and often does so in a very realistic way.  To me, magazines like Cosmo and Glamour really don't represent real life.  Nor do they have pictures of real women in the magazine.

I like this magazine for inspirational stories about women who got into shape.  Their health articles extend past the symptoms, and often have suggestions on prevention.  Their articles on nutrition are good, and once again realistic.  This magazine doesn't make you feel like you have to be a size 0, but rather small changes go make a difference."
Great price and very easy doing business with Amazon.
"I love the program and how easy it makes family genealogy tracking.  It has lots of options and additions; I love the fact that it automatically has a membership to ancestry... enough so that it got me in a mad rush to finish my genealogy before the trial was up.  That being said, it has a few flaws.

1- it's pretty much the same as ancestry.com. I do like having the program ON my computer and not necessarily having to log into Ancestry. But I'm unsure why, other than that, they made a program that isn't any different than their online program.

2- online ancestry is easier to search and get around than the program. I end up doing all my searching online, then syncing my program to the online tree (a great feature, by the way!).  So I wish I could work in the program and search from there but it doesn't work as well.

3- syncing isn't always easy, especially with blending multiple trees. I wish it would blend easier.

Other than that, I love the program. I like the fact that I can add additional notes in there that are not viewable online; for instance notes about my parents which I don't want public but I do want to have around for my children. They can access this in the future."
"This installed flawlessly on my Windows 7 computer. After it ran an update I was good to go. I liked the video in the beginning. it outlined every section that will be covered and was a great overview. This program works just like TurboTax. The process is broken up into sections that check themselves off as you complete them and there are several help options throughout the process. I found myself perusing the index often. I was flying through this. Our needs are quite simple. We have no additional properties beyond our primary nor do we have any additional investments beyond typical 401K's and simple bonds. The worksheets available as a PDF were great.

The whole process was smooth and simple to do. Willmaker 2012 fills a need for an average person to get the process started and you may discover that you need additional consultation. We were surprised to see in a list form of what we own.

Obviously If you have great wealth and many properties and funds to deal with this would not be the way to go.

I received this product free of charge to try through the vine program.
Would I spend my own money on this? Yes."
As advertised. Reasonably priced
Can't go wrong with a food gift card. Given to one who enjoys Panda Express!
"Imagine this: you're snowbound in a fancy Wiconsin hotel where you're supposed to be on a ski vacation. The manager just told you someone vandalized the historic library... and you're one of the only four people who made it to the hotel! There's Lisa Ostrum, the journalist who seems a bit too eager to become your friend, Jacque Brunais, a ski instructor from France who just lost the Olympics and is convinced something in the hotel will restore his name, Professor Hotchkiss, an old French teacher who is convinced that Marie Antoinette was a good-hearted person and is destined to prove it, and Mr. Egan the hotel manager who apparently has a criminal record and ties to this hotel. Now you feel it's up to you, as Nancy Drew, to question suspects and unveil a new page in French history.

Out of the so far 13 Nancy Drew games, this one is one of my all-time favorites because the story is so good! This game was pratically flawless! You never got stuck on what to do, but you never breezed through it either! It requires just the right amount of skill, thought, and fun to crack this case. Way to go HerInteractive!"
"I have a new PC with Windows 7 preloaded.  After THREE attempts to install NaturallySpeaking 11 it still will not startup. It is stuck on the ""welcome"" screen. What a waste. Shame on on Amazon for selling this program. There is NO help from Nuance.  What a shabby way to treat customers.
Save your money. DON'T BUY!"

"MS Office 2003 is the last 'Great' GUI version, imo -- that is, before the 'Ribbons' innovation happened, and the designers moved everything into hard-to-find places, and similar horrors.  Older MS Office 2000 was the last 5 star version, imo.  This version (2003) -- although superior to later versions -- did pick up a little bloat since 2000, and Help has largely become an online feature (not sure how much/to what extent), and that is mildly unfortunate.  Sad that MS _seems_ to be determined to somewhat ruin their flagship products in numerous ways (??) -- but very grateful their outstanding, earlier products can still be acquired and used, for a while anyway.

So, although not quite as hot as Office 2000, this 2003 version is more current concerning file formats, and new features that are needed on occasion.  IE:  you don't want WORD to crash when you are pasting some content from a Web page, right?  So in these instances, you're going to want a version that is capable of dealing with the newer XML, HTML, what have you.  Otherwise, there is little reason to upgrade from Office '97 for example, LOL.

I bought this used, open box for cheap!  And I am happy to say the Product Key worked, and online Activation was successful!  ...Yet this last point is likely more thanks to my particular vendor for this purchase ( Beadtribe2010 ) and whomever owned it last, for not being a pirate.  Thanks!"
"Antivirus is an important component of any operating system and its criticalness continues to grow in importance as more and more individuals find ways to infect computers, deliver spam, and otherwise do harm to the computers of others. I have used many antivirus software products and one that I continue to return to is McAfee. This latest version, McAfee Antivirus 2012 for 3 Users, is as good as ever, and I feel very confident that it will protect my information from harm.

McAfee Antivirus 2012 allows for loading on up to three different pc's for a single price and this makes it very useful for those who have pc's scattered around the house and do not want to invest in a separate antivirus purchase for each. Loading is easy and I like that McAfee Antivirus 2012 operates in the background, keeping your computer safe and without slowing down your processes. If you load a CD or anything else, it automatically scans and lets you know the coast is clear and when you schedule a nightly scan, it will tell you later if the scan didn't complete. These protections give me a safe, secure feeling and I can go about my day using my pc without worry.

McAfee Antivirus 2012 is great for fighting internet battles against viruses, spyware, and the like. If I had to find one small fault, it would be with the limitation with the three installations. If you don't install on three computers, you cannot install the remaining ones and expect it to last a full year. The countdown begins with the first install. So, if I install one on May 1, another on June 1, and a third pc on July 1, all three will reach their expiration on May 1. This is a small annoyance, but it really doesn't matter too much for me because I tend to load the antivirus on all three pc's at once anyway.

Virus protection is very important and McAfee Antivirus 2012 is one of the better products available for this purpose. It is much more intuitive than other antivirus products- so much so that a grade school age child could figure it out. It works the way an antivirus product should without slowing down your computer or causing any problems and it earns an enthusiastic recommendation."
"Installation was fairly easy - I put it on my desktop and a laptop at the same time.  The weird thing was that if you start the install by disc, you have to keep the disc in even if you select to download the most recent software from the website.  Once it started doing the download, I tried removing the disc figuring it shouldn't need it any longer.  It then got hung up waiting for me to put the disc back in.  Once I did, the install resumed and finished successfully.

Meanwhile, I initiated the install on the laptop by going to the URL provided on the registration key's card.  This was actually a more straightforward process as you log in to your account, enter the registration key, then it basically does the install.

The weird thing, though is that once finished, my desktop only shows that I've installed it on 1 pc.  Oh well, they're both protected.

I don't really like the user interface, as it just seems like you can't actually customize what components are turned on/off very easily, nor are there many customization options.

Our PC was also very slow after installation.  I turned off the site advisor add-ons that are supposed to protect against bogus websites and this has seemed to help to some degree, but other non-browser programs also seem to be slow to load on occasion as well.

The packages include so many protection programs, it's just hard to know what all it's doing, and with the user interface that doesn't really give you many details or options, it's hard to figure out what parts you really need and which are just superfluous.

One day, maybe these programs will actually track and tell you the lag they create by having to pre-scan files, websites and disc activity.  While this might protect you, it also slows you down.

All in all, it seems a bit slower than my old Norton package, and I'll probably look to switch back when this subscription is up."
"At first I thought that this product would be great for my teenagers' computers.  Then I read the fine print.

1. The ""protection"" is good for 1 year only & then you get to pay again.
2  You have to put in a credit card number when you install the software.
3. There is a Norton anti-theft icon on your desktop for any would-be thief to see.
4. Any would-be thief that knows a little about computers can override this Norton software and/or wipe the hard drive.

This software does not live up to my expectations.  For a laptop locator, I'd look elsewhere.

For phone tracking, I can do that for free on my Windows phone & the GPS is accurate, so this Norton software is not something I'd consider buying for my phone.  I believe that Android phones have a free tracking app too."
"PeachTree accounting software was known for being dry, hard to use and more barebones than Quickbooks Pro. It sold decently well because it was nearly free to run year after year as long as you didn't mind inputting changes manually. That meant it was the go to for old school paper and calculator types. While the fancier, easy to use Quickbooks Pro was sold to the masses who wanted things more automated.

Enter the all new Peachtree for 2013--Sage 50. A lot more than just the name changed. The biggest change is that while more features are streamlined, many now cost extra like Payroll and updated tax tables. Removing the options for manually inputting updates, Sage 50 is now trying to target the Quickbooks Pro crowd. The problem is that this is very much still a work in process. It isn't as automated nor as easy to use as Quickbooks Pro yet. My feeling is that they should have moved into this market softer by charging for addons but keeping the cost much lower to get customers used to paying for such services.

They basically took the single ""feature"" from Quickbooks Pro that users complain about (random features that are required for almost everyone costing extra) and adopted it here. The problem is such changes likely to scare off current customers who used Peachtree for value (Think JCPennys recently) without bringing in new customers (because there is no real reason to select this over QuickBooks for most people).

So why three stars? Because it works if you don't mind paying for extra features and it is a decent sized leap over the Peachtree's of the past. Now if they keep improving it every year and maybe adjust what they charge for, I could see this finally stealing customers from QuickBooks in about 2-3 years."
"I just went to a local seminar hosted by an estate planning law office this week and found out how much better a living trust is if you have more than $100K in assets (that includes the equity in your home, but not IRA, 401k, or life insurance value). If you hit that threshold, your standard Will ends up being a ticket for up to 2 years in probate. You still want a will when you do a living trust as sort of a catch-all, but with that you need the proper power of attorneys set up (note that was plural). The right kind of protection is a legal will, durable power of attorney for finances, directive for health care and caregiver instructions. Plus of course you want a Living Trust as the flag ship. I just learned all this YESTERDAY, while WillMaker was on my desk waiting to be used and reviewed. This version of WillMaker offers everything on the list I just gave, including a free one year subscription to Nolo's Living Trust service. That's huge and a a huge bargain, because a Living Trust is an updatable document that should be reviewed and refined as family situations change, hence the subscription.  The law office gave us their price sheet to set up all of these docs: $2,950, seriously. Considering all that goes into creating a fully protected and executable will and trust and all the rest, that's understandable for a local law office. But put that into a well-respected software package and you can save that huge fee if you understand the process. I didn't until last night, although I did a straight will 2 years ago with WillMaker 2014. The software is very easy to follow and has been around so long, all the ""odd circumstances"" are in there. If your situation is pretty straight forward where you own a house and have some savings and dependents, WillMaker in this version with the Living Trust is the way to go. I'm thrilled this came up for review, I only have that will and if something happens my family is stuck in probate."
"Do you need Win Zip is the real question.  If you need it, it is a great program.

You need Win Zip if....

*You have large files to send over email.
*You want to encrypt your messages.
*You send large photographs via email.
*You store a lot of really large files on your computer.

You do not need Win Zip if...
*You are sending stuff like 20 page Word docs.
*You just send snapshots for people to look at.

I had no trouble installing it on an eCafe netbook running Windows 7.  I do find it useful on the netbook, as it compresses the files for me and uses up less of my hard disc space and disc space on a netbook is at a premium."
This was a Christmas gift. The recipient was/is pleased. I would recommend and purchase again.
"Love, love, love these!! Great gifts!!!"
"Sure, there are other video editing software options out there, but quite frankly, I'm not going to spend close to a grand for something that I consider just a hobby and do for fun. i have been using VS since the X3 edition. Each upgrade (now up to x6) has added more features and streamlined the interface to make it so even novice users can make some great content.

If you are looking for editing software at a decent price, really consider this one.

I'll save the tech aspects for others, as they know way more about it than me. All I know is, it runs smooth, and is easy to use. The help feature to learn different things is also very well done. It's scary to think I have barely even touched the surface of what this software can do."

"I understand that the money magazine cover is going to change within a week. However, I currently have the December 2014 issue of money magazine  titled annual outlook issue make more money in 2015; great ideas that will help you prosper in the year ahead p. 64. Additionally, unintentionally spotting the article in this issue titled look better than a local, starts on page 44 cheered me up. This is because I know that I have to eventually move  regardless of how my employment picture would look in both the current and the new area, however I prefer to avoid sharing the when even though Im already somewhat aware of the timeline-because I would need to confirm with my husband and give my employer at least a two to three week notice on top of my intuitive and logical awareness that it may happen sooner than I expect. There is also some insightful information on getting mental health treatment, and the best fast path to a degree that is on page 81. Money magazine also publishes retirement features. For instance, the November 2014 Money magazine issue features an issue titled Retirement Guide 2015. Coping with The High Cost of Caregiving (starts on page 18) and philanthropy 101 (starts on page 40) are some of the features covered in the November 2014 Money magazine.  As mentioned in a previous review, I would be fine with being employed until Im at least 85. The only reason why my husband and I are already planning to save enough money to comfortably retire by the late 2030s/early 2040s or earlier is because of our shared belief that social security in the U.S. will not pay enough for even a cheap apartment  by the time the late 2040s/early 2050s roll around. Additionally, we are both aware that were part of a generation where retirement accounts are our responsibility, self-employment may be a necessity not just an option, and also preparing for the possibility of age related discrimination still existing for both genders of all ethnicities/races (especially with me being a minority woman)."
"I've used Acronis for many years.  I Think my first one was 2007, maybe 2005, I forget.

Anyhow, Acronis 2011 is very easy to use, it's super easy to make a boot disk and I can back up over my network.  The boot disk worked well on multiple pc's for booting them to the network.  It was a decent product, for the most part.

The primary issue I have (which Acronis still has not fixed even with 2013) is that when you do a RESTORE, even if you use Disk Signatures and restore them too... Acronis just can't figure out how to keep the machine joined to a domain!

When you do a FULL backup of a DISK... it's supposed to be a full, exact copy.

Acronis does not do that.  They are not exact backups.  IF they were, I would not continue to have this issue.

Just this weekend I did a restore of an image that is only 6 months old.  I restored to a new HD as I was going to upgrade to Windows 8.  Once again, as expected, Acronis did dropped my machine off of my network.  So I had to join the domain again and as mentioned... when you have to set up all emails profiles, all software, all everything... one may as well do a clean reinstall of everything.

Acronis again recommends to use their ""workstation"" version of their software, which is far more expensive and it's the same thing.

The products tend to fail you when you need them most.  Support is less than stellar.

What I find ironic is that every year... I buy an updated copy for I keep hoping and waiting that the day will come that they once again put out a quality product, as they did way back in the beginning.

Even with version 2013... I'm still waiting and as I do so, I continue to look at other backup solutions.

Acronis 2013... it's a lot like 2011 but seems to be less buggy, so I would recommend this if other decent alternatives can't be found and again, if you are not on a domain.

One thing I did like... I installed this on my primary PC (windows 7 machine).  Later, I upgraded my laptop to Windows 8 and found that NONE of the previous versions of Acronis were compatible.  They would not even install.  So I installed Acronis 2013.  When I went to register it... I got a warning and message that it was already registered and it showed me where.  But, unlike previous versions, I was asked if I wanted to move the license from that other machine to this one.  That I liked a lot.  It was a convenient feature vs. making me contact support or go have to log into some account somewhere and make changes.

IT too though, won't do a restore of a full disk accurately...

I just don't get it."
"Immediately got C++ runtime errors.  Need to go to Corel website and download latest version Pro x5 service pack 3!  Amamzon should state that it is only a 32 bit programs, therefore it runs slow, Windows 8 is 64 bit.  They immediately hit you up with an upgrade for PSP X6 for $60-70, which runs th 64 bit program."
I used them on our vacation.
Nice one
"Like you, I don't have time to write reviews -- but this product is such a disappointment I feel I must. I've used PC's for decades. Norton was once the only reliable protection -- back in the DOS days. I dropped Norton 5 years ago because it'd become a resource hog -- and went to PC-Cillin -- but it grew slower, so after 2 years I tried Norton again -- finding it still a resource hog. After 1 year, I switched to Bitdefender -- and found it much faster, but it slowed email too much --even with email scanning turned off. When the subscription ran out, I read reviews saying the ""new"" Norton was now the most efficient, with competitive protection -- and chose it for the coming year -- just 6 weeks ago. It's turned out to be unuseable -- unpredictable slow-downs (even in ""Silent Mode"") with system lock-ups (no blue screens, but same effect). I can't wait a year this time. I'll just have to write-off the expense and find another. Truth is, I've no way to vet the reviewers -- too many are ""planted"" by the manufacturers -- or seduced by their advertising money. IT MAY WORK FINE on many machines, BUT Norton 360v3 is the worst I've encountered -- so bad I can't wait until next year to find one that serves me."
"Unfortunately for programs like this, online sites like Mapquest and Google Maps have pretty much replaced this type of setup.  However, for someone who needs a map program that does not require connection to the Internet, this could serve a purpose."
Seemed rather ordinary but nice for presentation.
arrived fast easy to use
Junk--old junk.
"The only thing going for it is the context; these are recipes that have been posted online then tried and reviewed by thousands. And that's enough for me. I love the site, and the mag puts it in my hands. I feel confident using the recipes since I can see how they worked for others, how others changed them, and their ratings.
Every recipe I have tried worked as expected, and that's saying a lot."
"Very simply, QuickBooks is the standard for small business.  I would give them 5 stars if the setups for things like office supplies and cogs were already done.  Also the advertising is a little annoying.  I would pay an extra $5.00 to not get the e-mails and pop ups.  We have tried the other solutions and this is still the best.

Invest time up front getting all of your accounts set up correctly.  Trying to fix things later will be a HUGE waste of time.  The time up front will be a bargain.

One of the great tools that I don't see enough people use is building a ""package"".  For instance if you sell a group of parts the same way every time, build a package.  You can set up automatic purchase orders and automatic work orders in the contractor version.  Imagine taking a phone order for a big job and just clicking one package to invoice, purchase and create a workorder to get all of the paperwork done.

QuickBooks will really help you save time running your business if you spend a little time up front or hire someone to get it all set up correctly from the beginning."
"I have used turbo tax for many years and appreciate the value it brings.

It can be of great help. It takes a long time to master this speech to text software. It is time well spent.
"Quicken has abandoned the users of the Mac platform, so the users of the Mac platform should abandon Quicken.

Like most other people reviewing the product, I became accustomed to Quicken for Windows, and then sought a similar financial software title after switching to the Mac.  Despite the ""Quicken"" logo on the box, this is NOT a solution for my needs.

If you're going to spend this much money on financial software, it's safe to assume you need it to do more than provide you with a running total and colorful icons - you need it to track each transaction, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS, have robust budgeting features and flexible account / category creation / interaction.  Quicken Essentials for Mac does not fit the bill.

I found, and after a slight learning curve, have come to love&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Moneydance/dp/B00005A9VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Moneydance</a>.  The software is no longer available from Amazon, but can be downloaded directly from the developer.  It's written in Java, so it's completely cross-platform (running exactly the same way on Mac, Windows, or if you swing that way, Linux).  It has almost all of the features of Quicken, with the exception of tight integration with TurboTax- you can download new transactions for all accounts with one button, it securely stores account passwords, it can track most every type of investment transaction (notable absences include not-yet-vested stock and option grants), it can print checks, and you can design as many budgets and reports as you need.  Plus, it's extensible, so you can download extensions that will allow you to export tax-relevant transactions to the TXF format (used by TurboTax), or perform a number of other useful features.

Finally, Moneydance absolutely CRUSHES Quicken when it comes to data freedom - it stores all your data in XML format, and can easily export data should you ever want to move back to Quicken (you know, if you're a masochist) or to any other financial title.  Anyone who's ever tried to extract a decade's worth of data from Quicken will be sure to appreciate this feature, and recognize the confidence the developer must have in his software if he doesn't feel compelled to trap you into using it (a la Intuit).

Since Intuit can't be bothered to write good financial software for the Mac, support developers that can.  Get Moneydance, and you won't regret it."
"My HP came with Norton antivirus trial, and I installed McAfee 2013, which seems to have worked.  Norton still had residual components, but I can't recall whether this is due to Norton or McAfee removal processes.  When I tried to update to McAfee 2014, I expected to simply enter in a new code-- maybe 5 minutes.  Instead, the process turned in 70 minutes.

My McAfee 2013 ran for an entire year, and now this 2014 update needs to remove Norton residual components?

20 minutes wasted.  Then I contacted McAfee, who wasted another 25 minutes before their asking for a fee for removing Norton.  Huh?  I thought this issue was resolved in 2013.  Furthermore, I expected McAfee would just advise me how to remove Norton, if not remove it for me.

So, I searched Norton and found a removal tool.

Wasted 70 minutes roughly.  I thought McAfee should have sent me a link where the Norton removal tool was located, insted of wasting 70 minutes of my time."
"I'm one of those folks who has used QuickBooks on PC for a dozen years or so. Yes, as you can read in other reviews here, this new Mac version can't touch the PC version on a feature-for-feature basis. The PC version is so much more mature, has so many more options and value-added services (not to mention complete payroll management, if you need that), whereas the Mac version is just coming out of the starting gate.

BUT, if you're running a Mac and don't want to bother with a PC, or with running Windows on your Mac just to run QuickBooks, and if you don't need to manage payroll or use some of the other advanced features, then you can feel comfortable with buying QuickBooks as an entry-level solution for a small business. Really, it's not that bad! It's just simple, and contains only a small subset of the features you get on the Windows version.

You can set up income and expense accounts, you can set up invoices and sales receipts, you can track your various bank and credit accounts, and much more. The Amazon product description gives you lots of detail, as does the Intuit website for QuickBooks, so I'm not going to repeat all the features here.

Bottom line: yes, Mac users can do simple accounting for small business with this version, and it's not as full-featured as the Windows version. Let's hope Intuit takes this software seriously, realizes more and more small business owners are using Macs (they must realize it or they wouldn't have backed out of their non-Mac mindset after all these years), and then adds more of the features that make this software a mainstay of small businesses who like running Windows PCs."
"Great magazine for horse tips such as blankets, tack, riding both English & Western. Many of the articles give a good overview but do not go into depth. At least you are told a little bit and do further research for yourself. Not a magazine if you are looking for horse health articles. I love the monthly article they do on a specific breed of horse describing the origins of the breed, historic & modern uses, breed standards, etc. The illustrations are clear and well done including a fold out of the breed of the month."
"The 2013 version of Sage Pro Accounting edition is very different from older/previous versions. The most significant chance is you have to pay to have the tax format tables work. Previous editions of Sage have always given the user the option to enter their tax information manually. This process is moderately easy and once learned is very easy to annually update (and costs nothing). However Sage Pro or any edition of Sage has never been an easy program to pick up and use with ease. For new users who have never touched a Sage program I would Highly recommend reading up on it prior or else you'll be left with a blank stair or confusion.

Sage Pro is more of a business edition meant mainly for small business or people who must also manage their employees.

I have used Peachtree software in the past and it has always been reliable and easy to use. However the 2013 Sage Pro has turned their popular program into another way to make tons of money. Depending on your choices you could easily spend $250-300 dollars a yeah on the tax program alone.

Sage is meant to work on all recent editions of Windows. No need to buy the New Version stick with the Old."
"WinZip is the file compression software to beat.  There are certainly many other companies trying to compete with this ongoing trustworthy tool, but you will always go back to WinZip if you ever stray away.

WinZip is fast, and saves space better than ever.  It makes sending something via email much easier, for instance, audio or video files.  Less bouncing back because the file was too big.

So it covers your compression and sharing needs, but also has security features keeping your content private.  You can store files on your system with password protection, or give files to others that have the password.

There are plenty of tools on board to work with various media and file types.  You can attach your work from the program to email. You can shink or resize files before compressing, saving even more space.  And it features an easy to understand and helpful organization system that will keep track of every file and it's location.  It's much more than file compression these days, they have moved forward to utilize their product as a necessity, not only for work, but home office, and personal collections."
"I've been a Streets & Trips user since the program was introduced.

  It has never been tops in its class, but it was superior to similarly priced products like Delorme's.

  With S&T 2009, however, Microsoft falls behind the curve in terms of user interface, map accuracy, technology and, importantly, customer care.

  The customer care aspect is perhaps the most important. S&T is great for trip planning. However, Microsoft now restricts installation to two computers, which was not the case with earlier versions. Likewise, there is no option to deactivate the program, a la Adobe, prior to installing on another computer. As far as I can determine, once you install it on two computers, you're stuck unless you call Microsoft's Asian-based customer service and manage to beg another registration code, such as when you replace one of the computers.

  This is simply a bad business model, in my opinion.

  Next, the maps are increasingly outdated. I checked the restaurants around my home and they are at least three years or more out of date. From reading Amazon reviews, I picked up some roads in the Chicago area that others claimed weren't on the map, though they have been in place for a long time. The critics are right: even a major expressway extension that was completed several years ago isn't on the maps.

  Sure, Microsoft licenses the maps from a cartographic compiler, but you'd think they'd exercise more quality control on behalf of their customers and demand more up-to-date maps.

  Nope.

  Finally, on my list of major deficiencies, is the interface. It really isn't much different than prior years and is simply growing stale. Three keystrokes to update the route directions from the GPS is too much.

  Overall, S&T 2009 is as good as it ever was - and that's the problem: it isn't changing much from past versions and it does not help that the maps are so outdated. The clumsy attempt to force the user to purchase a copy for every computer they might run it on is ridiculous: the basic license should cover at least two computers. Even Adobe is that liberal.

"Windows 8 or 8.1 does work very well. Boots up fast depending on what also starts with it.
The major issue seems to be the true functioning start button.
8.1 puts the start button back on the screen but its a farce in function. Its there and that's about it.

The solution I used was ""Start menu 8"" by IObit. The people that put out Advanced system care.
It is a small stand alone program that's free. It returns everything that the original start button had.
It makes Windows 8 usable for me and in fact better than 7."

Still using this version in 2014 and very happy with it.  QuickBooks is the best accounting system out there in my humble opinion.  Amazon is always my go to source for software as they seem to always have the best price.  Very happy with my purchase.
"This product is a joke.  Using Windows 7 64 bit.  Would not install.  Checked their website.  Live Chat?  Said try again later.  Called the number and got an off-shore person who couldn't spell 'Tampa' where I was calling from.  They said it could take up to an hour to install.  An hour for a silly card program?  My DVD drive spun for 2 hours with no progress on the install bar.  You know this isn't even Hallmark, they out-source this to Nova, the maker of all those other mediocre products.  I'm actually a registered user of Hallmark 2011, but this upgrade was a disaster."
"Here's a simple, straightforward review.

I have used Cyberlink products for at least the last 5-10 years. I have always thought the software does what it says it will do and is easy in doing it. PowerDVD 13 continues the tradition.

Installation (on a Win7 64-bit HP ProBook) was a breeze: stick the CD in and follow instructions. Done.

Using the program was equally easy. First you enter the supplied product key. Once activated (internet connection required) the welcome screen offers an option to see some tutorials on the Cyberlink website (the package also includes a printed manual that is well-written, easy to understand, and helpful [but I'm not so sure you will even need the manual]). Once you get to the main screen it will tell you either to insert a BluRay (or DVD) or click on ""play.""

It's that easy. Really. Not kidding.

5 stars.

"After shelling out for the 2011 version of Family Tree Maker Platinum, I waited with bated breath for the 2012 version to grace my doorstep.

Not because I loved 2011, but because *anything* had to be better than 2011. I'm sorry to report, 2012 is basically more of the same.

More of the same ""Did someone write this in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Access/dp/B004MNDVN4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Access</a>?""
More of the same ""Why doesn't this look like it does online?""
More of the same ""But I can't just export everything I have on the site to a 'nice' format I can share with others?""
More of the same ""Why can't I just enter a license code, instead of having to call and get them to stop billing my credit card for six months' worth of service?""

If you haven't been using genealogy software for some time, Family Tree Maker is a pretty hateful application to fight with -- but, it also costs about half of what you'd pay for the included six months' service.

If you have been using the Family Tree Maker series up through the more recent iterations, you're not going to have to learn anything new to step in to 2012. That's probably the only real feature it offers over 2011."
Great price on what is in my opinion one of the best anti virus software's built.

"Corel continues its impressive series of high performing graphics suite with this version X7. As usual, the flagship product is the immensely powerful vector drawing program, CorelDraw. It is intuitive to use but comes with a comprehensive help file that does an excellent job of explaining the major topics. It is always available directly on the interface.
Added to this are the (now) great number of videos and tutorials available online. Time was, a search on YouTube provided not many results (as compared to some other suites). This has changed and I believe Corel has undertaken an effort to introduce its suite of products to more people, who are in turn producing content on their behalf. There's also an excellent manual available for purchase, which while it is for X6, still pertains.
I noticed that with this new version, the speed of start up is much faster than with X6. Installation is straightforward and easy to navigate though there is at least one puzzling thing where updates always show an Internet Explorer security error message. Work output type is profuse, including PDF. I have never used the image acquisition (TWAIN, WIA) so I can't say much about it. There are a tremendous amount of settings (the RGB profile, for example, is more than 20 items long) so some time will be expended to get really comfortable with it. However, intuitive isn't the wrong descriptor here. You can accept the defaults and play, and still figure out how to produce some pretty good content. Be aware, however, there's a reason it costs a pretty penny to acquire, and why professional T-Shirt graphics designersthe ones I know anywayoverwhelmingly use CorelDraw: it's top-notch software, and to get really good requires study. Luckily, there are now more resources than ever.
If you have multiple monitors, CorelDraw X7 will be a delight to use as you may undock any number of sections to use. I don't have one, but I have seen some work with digital pens (on a tablet) that will blow you away.
Let's be honest, the other ingredient products in the suite aren't as good as Draw. PhotoPaint is a perfectly adequate image manipulation software that does not approach Photoshop or even Corel's other products in the space, PaintShop Pro. Font Manager is a nicety but not it's not going to be a staple in your everyday use.
In all, a worthwhile, faster, better version upgrade from X6. 5 stars."
"Norton has cut costs and provided more ""coverage "" in ways that I find slightly positive but still generally good. NIS, no longer exists, but a product that works on multiple platforms now exists. In other words, they are trying to be all things to all people. Whilst the Norton Security Software that is similar to NIS is , in my view, still very good, the gradual shift to a cloud based product is going to provide them with more problems in the long term. Whilst 5 items covered for what used to be priced for 3, is generally a good value, the annoying problem is that the cloud emphasis is too much of an issue, for example, web site IDs that store IDs and Passwords 100% in the cloud leaves the data too susceptible, as well as making the ID and passwords unavailable a portion of the time ( there is no such thing as 100% cloud up time), so basically I have to use KeePass, and I have 2 major AV and Antimalware suits that I am recommending over Norton. Norton has some good products, but they are writing themselves out of the picture and it is a marketing problem when they are destroying what I think is a good product."

"We have a 5 year old laptop that we were about to throw away because it was too slow running XP.  So I thought let's install Windows 7 and see what happens.  The difference in speed dramatic.  Now the programs launch right away and there is little delay switching back and forth between tasks.  It feels like a new computer.  Later on I placed a $[...] 4GB flash drive in the USB port to take advantage of ReadyBoost.  Now this laptop is really speedy.  Since we were going to trash this laptop, but now we can use it a couple more years, the purchase of the Windows 7 upgrade was well worth the price.

Update 11/3/09: Someone commented that maybe it was just faster because I cleaned out the ""bloatware"" that was on the old XP system.  Well that doesn't apply in this case, because I'm talking about a clean XP install vs. a clean Windows 7 install.  Previously we tried to make the laptop faster by installing XP from scratch.  That didn't help, but Windows 7 did the trick to speed things up.  I can only guess that Windows 7 is just better optimized under the hood."
"I am a retired systems manager, with experience with Microsoft Windows. several flavors of Unix, limited use of OS-X, and such long-gone operating systems such as MS-DOS, IBM-DOS, TRS-DOS, CP/M, and DEC's RSTS..

Looking back over my use of  MS Windows products for nearly 30 years, I would never have rated any release higher than ""3."" This is because Microsoft's corporate culture is marketing-driven, not quality-driven. Its products are pushed out the door much too quickly, and many of the security vulnerabilities, bugs, and undesirable ""features"" are never fixed. What's more--customers get whiplash from Microsoft's constantly ripping up the user interfaces to which customers have become accustomed, and replacing them with something far different and non-intuitive.  This costs customers time and frustration, and businesses money in lost productivity. Add to those problems the registry--a cumbersome, unreliable cornerstone of this system, and frustration and loss of productivity are guaranteed. From my perspective, the only reason for using Windows is that its software is ubiquitous--if you want to do application x and want to share it with user y, you tend to be in the Windows trap.

Although Windows 8 is better than some (such as the infamous Vista), it still has bugs. Such as the one that prevents some laptops from completely shutting down and powering off. Even the implementation of several ""fixes""--some by Microsoft, some by others--failed to fix this problem on a Lenovo laptop. Restarts and shutdowns will reach a point where the machine is doing nothing for an extended period, and yet it is still powered on. You must manually power it off, then on again.

If you are purchasing Windows 8.x, yet prefer the user interface of Windows 7 (or got used to it), you may wish to consider downloading and installing the free product, Classic Shell, which safely restores that look and performance."

My bottle did not come with a sprayer but I guess this would be another way to use the product:  spritz over fabrics like couches, beds linens.

One thing that was odd about this is the lid was on rather loosely with no safety seal.  Some of the product had leaked into its inner shipping poly bag.  Perhaps a safety seal would eliminate this from happening as well as add a modicum of safety.

In terms of potency, the product I received for this review has a very noticeable lavender scent.  It does not appear weak or understated at all.  Since others have had this concern, it does make me wonder about the company's QC.

Overall - this is a nice product which lends a nice fragrance to my clothing.  I would recommend it."
"At first I was enthusiastic about Norton 360, Version 2. I installed it on computers with both Microsoft XP and Vista Home Premium operating systems.  I previously had Norton Internet Security installed on both, so I thought it was just an upgrade.  For this reason I gave the program 4 stars.  Now I'm not sure.

After two months the XP operating system ran without any problems either on Visa or XP.  But then the new computer running on Vista crashed.  I lost all my files and had to access the recovery portion of the hard drive to get the computer to boot.  Then I had to download all the security downloads.  I have only dial-up so this has taken many hours.  And I have to reinstall all the programs I use - and delete the junk programs that came with the HP computer.  What a mess, and what a lot of work. Even the backup disk, created with Norton 360 didn't work as I hoped.  I do have all the files on the disk, but they did not all reload after I fixed the crash.

Update 3/1/09:  Maybe the problem was with the operating system, Vista Home Premium; or maybe it was Norton 360.  And maybe the glitch was repaired with a later update I download.  Anyway, the problem hasn't manifested itself since I reinstalled everything. Furthermore, I must admit, the problem never did occur with the WinXP operating system.  Also, it should be noted that the program I'm using has been updated with a new version.

Update 6/7/09:  I have continued to use Norton 360, Ver. 2.0, for another three months with Vista and WinXP and have had no new problems. Actually, I have grown to like Norton 360 and now rely on it with confidence.  It has reported stopping over a hundred threats and has stopped me cold when I accidentally entered several attack sites."
The Family Tree Maker would not work on my Windows 7 64 bit computer. I had to send it back. I used the ancestory.com online website instead.
"We got this for 2 Macs and 2 Windows machines. It works OK on both platforms. I use it mostly on a Mac, now. I don't like that almost every time I go to use it, there's yet another update to go through. It's really annoying. We've since gone with the monthly online version."
Informative and often brilliant.
"This edition of Turbotax lacked several help screens. There was a message stating that help would be added at a later upgrade.
Other than that, I think I did pretty well with my taxes. I filed them in late February."
"Having an impossible time downloading this.  It downloads, but won't install.  I called Adobe and got a non-English speaking person that I could not understand very well (and that is putting it nicely).  I have not had time to troubleshoot the problem, so even though I purchased it two weeks ago, I still have not been able to use it.  Thus, I cannot rate the quality of it, just the install trouble."
"I have this OS on an old laptop and it is truly madning. Crashes like there's no tommorw.  Security holes the size of the ozone.  Windows 95/98 were good but this is when the wheels came off, this was like a pre Vista it was that bad, thus far I would say ME and Vista are still the worst version of windows I have ever used, yes even worse than Windows 8 in terms of bugs/crashes."
"Thanks Symantec...you've officially change my attitude (for the better) about running security software!

I have to admit that when it comes to running security software, I have never practiced what I preach.  For example, I installed antivirus software on my parents' computer years ago, but I almost never run it on mine.  Why?  Because I've grown tired of software that slows down my system, but my parents care less about performance, so it's not a big deal for them.

Without exception, over the past several years, every time I've attempted to put security software on my own computer (antivirus, firewall), the impact on system resources has been frustrating.  I think it's dangerous to be without such software, but every time I try, my system comes to a screeching halt.

So, after roughly another year of ""living on the edge"", I found a good price on Norton Internet Security 2012 and decided to give it another shot.  I was absolutely amazed at how unobtrusive their software has become!  NIS 2012 has actually changed my attitude about Symantec (a major culprit in the past in my battle to protect my computer's CPU and RAM).

Here's what I noticed:
+ Installation went very quickly!  I didn't time it, but I'm pretty sure the process took less than a minute.
+ Updates went very quickly!  It turns out that event though I bought this 2012 version, I was eligible to update to the 2013 version for free.  This process was simple and quick.
+ Though I know it is running in the background (and as an add-in for my Google Chrome browser), NIS 2012 (and 2013) has been barely noticeable.  I am able to go about my business-as-usual with no apparent issues from Norton.

About the only time I observe Norton doing its work is when I download a file over the internet.  Norton politely pops up, checks the file to see if its safe, and then disappears moments later when it is done checking.

So, as long as NIS continues to quietly protect my computer in the background, I plan to stick with it!"
I have been a TurboTax user since 1994 never had a serious problem and I have always trusted the software.
Got this for my niece and she loves it!!!
it will last 6 mouths and u get to do it agian
"Always acceptable and widely enjoyed by all ages and tastes.  When you don't have any idea of a specific gift, these gift cards are perfect.  Also, Amazon has such a large range of items, there is always something for everyone."
I love the smell of this body wash! It doesn't dry out my skin either!
"I had no issues setting up on my PC with this prepaid card. If you're familiar at all with Photoshop CC and Lightroom, you know these are quality products. No difference here, I've been an Adobe user for several years and they've yet to really disappoint me with any of their products. Recommended."
Great addition to Christmas!
"This isn't a perfect typing software, I suppose, but it's great for beginners or even a brush-up. I used it ahead of obtaining a mandatory typing certificate for my job, and my husband used it as well. We both saw good results, and I passed my test. My major issue is that this isn't entirely intuitive to set up. However, once it's installed and you get going, it's easy to use and obviously effective."
"It's kind of an odd mix of reviews here. Evidently, there have been multiple listings and products used under this number so that there are multiple items being reviewed. I am reviewing the exfoliating gloves. They are mediocre. They are just a little rough and are good for things like legs and your back, at least the parts you can reach! The gloves are nothing super special and eventually, they get a little gross. You have to keep them clean as well and let them dry completely otherwise they will go yucky."
"I've had four previous versions of this product before online mapping sites made the pre-trip-planning portion of this software mostly obsolete.  It has had a good run.  It still offers something to those who want to plan long road-trips in legs, I guess, but even that use is fading with more compact GPS systems.  The mapping system does what it says it does, so that's fine....

What bothers me is how poorly the GPS hardware works.  Upon first installation, I was right next to a window, and it could not pick up any satellites at all and asked if I had a clear view of the sky -- well, no, and unless you're driving in a convertible....

Finally, as a passenger in a mini-van, I was able to obtain ""constant-intermittent"" service.  ""Huh?"" you might well ask.  Well, at least every mile, the hardware would lose satellite tracking, reacquire it, and then squelch out in its chirpy/brittle voice (even my old GPS has 6 smooth voice-choices for English) that it was re-routing and tell me again and again and again what the next turn is.  That became extremely annoying after about 3 minutes, as it was impossible to have a conversation in the vehicle, even when the next turn is in 51 miles.

I tried the male-to-famale USB cord they included to enhance the signal.  It's 28"" long (not including the connectors).  This is just long enough to be too long to rest the receiver on your lap(top) and too short to tape it to the windshield or a window, which might actually be useful.  Another loser component.

There's no traffic notification system designed into this system, which is something even my 2-year-old Garmin has.  That feature saves me a LOT of time sitting in traffic, and I can't see going backwards to this MS offering.

Also, you can't just type in a destination while driving.  You have to set up a complete ""trip"" before-hand.  This is just silly.  What you must do is create and plan a ""trip"" to your destination from some place you recently passed, while driving (disclaimer....), from whence it will re-route your ""trip,"" just to make the unit function using the same approach it did years ago before the GPS component was introduced.  It's almost as if the MS designers knew this was a dying breed and didn't bother to fix such obvious flaws, such as the passenger (or driver) trying to manage a laptop while driving...."
"This review is on the magazine Forbes and not the Amazon subscription or subscription process.

Forbes is a ""to the point"" magazine.  I appreciate that.  The articles a short, concise and not lacking in information.  While I also read a few other financial magazines, Forbes is the one I will go back to and grab to reread a particular point about a particular issue.

This magazine, while full of ads like the others, offers a great deal of insight between the covers.  Honestly, if I were to be asked to specify just one financial magazine to read, Forbes would be my answer."
"Was not what I expected.  Is too basic for what my needs were.  Simple, fairly easy to learn but didn't have the features I needed."

"I took the leap and installed Windows 8 Pro. I didn't do a clean install due the complex system I have and the number of programs and hardware that would have to be re-installed. I chose the upgrade from Windows 7, keeping existing settings and files. This process took longer almost 55 minutes. The install asked one question, uninstall MS Security Essentials? The anti-virus is now part of the OS. I did the whole install within Windows 7. Upon completion Metro appeared, when I flipped to my desktop it was as the same original 7. Wallpaper, folders and programs were all there. MS Office, Chrome and Firefox. IE10 is remarkably fast. Plus works great with a mouse.
So far I'm extremely pleased, almost high."
"I never have a chance to download the item, it keeps asking to purchase another code. And when it goes to Symantec website setup, it becomes more complicated. I will not purchase again."
I've renewed my subscription 3 times. This magazine is always interesting and has great writers. I read it cover to cover every  month. Great magazine -- none better.
"Powerful accounting or bookkeeping software for your business. Yearly support services require you to purchase annually and this is trending with what the industry is doing with Office Software and also with accounting software. Quickbooks only supports a few years before it no longer is supported and is essentially obsolete.

Sage (formally Peachtree) is a robust and complete set of accounting tools for those that provide services or for those that track inventory (much more complex). The email of invoices is a handy internal tool, but the lack of payroll options outside of an add on is somewhat frustrating.

All in all, those that are familiar with this software or those that need more robust tools will really appreciate the software, for those that are new, it will have a steep learning curve with productive results."
"and so when they mailed me the free software for my Mac, I decided to use it again. We have rental properties and when I started to input the information, the software quickly recommended upgrading to premium. Ok, so I did. Now, I have to ditch this whole return and buy Turbo Tax as well since it's screwed up my rental figures by applying ""real estate professional"" to one property only. It's mysteriously disallowed my depreciation.

The questions the program asks are lockstep and don't give enough straight forward help (like the other reviewer it was recommended that I read some lengthy IRS pamphlet- that's a great help-- thanks a lot!!) and it is difficult to know where it goes wrong in the interview. I think this software was rushed onto the market without enough testing. However, I'm sure that if your return is fairly simple and not 35 pgs long like mine, it works OK."
"Intuit would like to force me to pay extra in order to buy the Small Business edition of TurboTax.  I have a small business and can recite schedule C with my eyes closed. Since I never needed ""extra help"", TurboTax Deluxe worked perfectly for me, until this year. Intuit has crippled Deluxe and Premier for small business owners and is extorting extra money from its users for simple functionality. Oh, they said, I can print out the forms, fill them out by hand and then mail my return in. Why would I buy tax return software that did not efile?  Did the Ferengi aliens take over Intuit? This is the most ludicrous statement I have ever heard!

Done with TurboTax!  After using TurboTax ever since it came out (over 20 years ago), I have switched to H&R Block Deluxe which imports perfectly from last years TurboTax return, W2s, broker transactions and yes, ability to do schedule C and 5 free Federal efiles... everything that TurboTax Deluxe used to do!

Just because I hate corporate greed, I am now looking for a replacement for Quicken. I have two years before I have to pay the extortion fee (forced upgrade) for Quicken."
i got this for my daughter she loved it!
Works great but still learning all the great features.
I really enjoyed this product.  I was amazed that a person with a limited computer skills as myself could do as well as I did.  It is easy to use and quite straightforward.  I designed a very cool webpage for my friend.  Recomended
Perfect for gift giving!!!
"Oh, I wish I could describe this scent and do it justice! First of all, I love citrus scents and secondly, who doesn't love a smell of a fresh sugar cookie? This is a light, breezy smell that is just stong enough without overpowering. I'm someone that gets bothered by strong perfumes and this is just perfect. Light, airy and yummy. Great for teens and tweens as well. It also comes in a small spray bottle (not offered here) that is an even better bargain."
It worked great.
"A Very Reliable and Upgraded Version of MS Office (Excel, PowerPoint, Word & Outlook.
Can't get along without them . . . and they have improved since the last edition."
"I am absolutely amazed that this piece of garbage was shoved out the door for sale to the consumer.  Read my reviews, see how I praised the last 2 years of this product.  I was happy to upgrade when I received the email from them.  It's such a great product, I had no qualms for upgrading every year.

I downloaded the new installer and viola! the problems started.  First off, this program requires you to uninstall older versions of the previous product.  Well I was a happy user of PC-Cillin 2006 and thought no problem.  Big mistake!  Their uninstaller couldn't rid my system of all of the files so every time I ran the installer I was told another version existed on my computer and I needed to uninstall.  Guess what?  The uninstaller cleared out enough files that it couldn't launch the uninstaller for 2006.  What a joke!  It took a special uninstaller from the company to clear out all of the garbage.  I should have known right there that 2007 was going to be a disaster.  To my surprise (not really) 2007 would not install/load properly.  And the best part?  It cleared out my 2006 so I had nothing to go back to.

Can you say ZoneLabs Internet Security?  I can, did and I'm not looking back!

How does garbage like this get out to the market?  Steer clear if you value your PC."
"I bought this for my brother for his bday, although he hasn't used it yet I'm sure it works as expected"
I love the linden scent; it's so refreshing.  All of the Pre de Provence soaps I've tried are such a treat.
"There is a lot that can be accomplished with PaintShop Pro X5 Ultimate to make your photographs really stand out. The main problem for me is learning how use all the features of the software. It was a little tricky to get up and running during install, but I now have it working and have been impressed with the added features from the last version. It is a decent photo program."
great Christmas gift
"I can't believe that there are so many negative reviews of a software that's not even used until January 2009 when it's not even Thanksgiving.  It's difficult for me to accept that all of the people who posted a have actually used the 2008 version of TurboTax and dislike it. I'm giving this 3 stars because I haven't used it yet, but all my prior years' usage would get 5 stars.  I'm checking out the printing fee directly with Turbotax instead of automatically believing a negative review and then posting another negative review before actually using the software.  I suspect that H&R Block is having their employees post negative reviews in order to get people to purchase their own tax software.  I'm not buying it."
Good quality
You can't go wrong with this device.  It's the only hub I have that operates solely on power supplied by the PC.  Plug it in and go.  It's that easy to use.
I WAITED TIL NOW TO PURCHASE THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE I ALREADY HAD THE 2007 PROGRAM.  I ALWAYS WISHED I HAD MICROSOFT OFFICE ON OTHER COMPUTERS AND GRABBED THIS ONE WHEN I SAW IT WAS A 3 PC USER PRODUCT.  NOW  I HAVE THE PROGRAM WHERE I WANT IT WHEN I NEED IT.
"Have used TurboTax Business for over 20 years.  You should conclude I really like it and find it's economical.  The problem I have is with the Efile feature and its signing procedure.  That procedure is too complex so even though it's included in the program I don't use it and just mail my return.  The IRS needs to simplify the ""signature"" procedure."
Great way to shop for gift cards.
They love the Amazon cards. Amazon needs to add more choices in the gift boxes
"I originally got a subscription to Islands on a whim as I hibernated through a cold Chicago winter. I was pleasantly surprised by the stunning depictions of different islands as well as the diversity of articles and islands they chose to feature. Some articles talked about local food, others discussed culture etc. One of my favorite articles in particular was about a European island where people typically lived to be over 100. It not only showed pictures of the island but also had some wonderful writing about the lifestyle, people and history of it."
It didn't work with my new Windows 7 computer so I returned it. Microsoft makes things so complicated.
"I do not like this software:

- It could not retrieve my 2008 return
- The stock sales are confusing and unclear
- Scary : they knew my health history. Where did they get this info and how?
  I am very disturbed.

Stay clear and use an accountant."
"Do you need an antivirus (AV) program if you have a networked computer?  ABSOLUTELY!  Do you need an antispyware (ASW) program if you web surf?  You probably should.  Do you need Trend Micro's AV and ASW 2010?  Uhm, no.

TM's AV is BASIC.  If you have to pay for this, you can get the same basic AV capabilities using free online software (do a google search on free antivirus).  You'll note that when you look at the back of the box--not shown on Amazon, you can see that our of all the nifty gadgets and gizmos that TM AV premium has, and wonder why the heck you bought the basic version--there's not much there.

Sure, TM's AV/ASW 2010 quotes itself for being optimized for WINXP, WINVISTA, and WIN7, but to tell the truth, so do all the other AV's out there.  And guess what?  There's no proof in the pudding.  It's no faster or slower than anything else out there, but there's not much to the program, so yeah, it's probably much quicker than its premium cousins.  Big surprise.

TM's AV/ASW 2010 has a feature that is kind of odd is its behavioral engine--I have no idea what it does, and you'll never find out in the manual either.  Also, it does the basic quick scans, full scans, and scheduled scans, but the timing for the scheduler leaves A LOT to be desired.

Bottom line: should you purchase this?  If you don't do the research on any other AV program, and you really want to have basic AV protection, then yes.  However, I'd say just get a little web search savvy and pick up some freeware OR go to the well-established AV products from the ""other"" companies."
"this street atlas is very good
it works great on both Vista and XP

Gift card just as expected
"For the price this is a pretty decent language program, but it's pretty basic. To break it down, you get several items in this set. First there is the pocket guide, which in my opinion isn't really sized for a pocket. It's a 7 x 20 piece of cardboard that is folded so that it's 7 x 5 when closed. There are six-pages of words & phrases printed a bit too small for my eyes (about 5pt). The small print and high-gloss finish made it hard for me to read. Second there is an smart-phone/tablet app, which is apparently the new feature for this package. The app was easy to install (I downloaded it from the Amazon appstore to my Kindle HD 10). There is an access code that you have to put in to download the Level 1 Spanish language module. The app is pretty basic, with a male and female speaking each word. I actually like this as there are some differences in the pronunciation, which I think helps to make it easier to understand the different way people can say the same thing. It's a bit disappointing that you only get the module for the one level. I think you have the option of purchasing others.

The bulk of the language package is the software and the interactive DVD. The software was simple to install and worked well on my computer with MS Windows 7 Pro. While I've used the lesson/tutorials, I haven't played with the Oscar Lake game much. You can also record yourself as you're doing the lessons so that you can compare your efforts to say the words and phrases. I didn't have a microphone so I haven't been able to do that yet. The lessons seem to be broken down well, and are easy to follow. The interactive DVD is pretty clunky, you have to advance through the individual parts of the levels using your DVD player remote. I'm not really sure what you get out of doing the DVD over the computer program  you pretty much cover a lot of the same material in the same way.

As I mentioned, I think this is a pretty decent language program, and I think eventually I'll be able to pick up some basic Spanish from using it. But like learning most things  you have to put in the time and effort to make doing this successful. You're not going to learn Spanish overnight."

"PSP X8 Ultimate was just fine...until X9 was released. Like most other users I now receive nags daily to upgrade X8 to the newest version. I have done everything I can think of (and every remedy others have Googled) to terminate these annoying upgrade solicitations from Corel. I've unchecked both boxes provided in X8's ""communications preferences"" submenu (in the program's help page), and I have expressly requested Corel in the company's privacy settings section for my account, to cease sending notices pertaining to upgrades, fixes, etc., -- all to no avail. I've utilized W Windows 10's notifications options in my effort to prevent these nag ads from appearing on my screen -- but nothing seems able to end these unwanted intrusions. I guess all that's left is to delete PSP X8 and all references to Corel in the Registry -- and end a very long-standing relationship with that company."
great articles!
"First off I did like using this software. It was simple to install, easy to use and functioned well.

The problem that I see AVG having is, proving enough worth for people to jump from the free version of their software to something that requires a yearly fee. A couple years ago I moved from Norton's to McAfee and then finally to AVG. I enjoyed it for the simplicity that it is. There is no bloated resource drain, etc. It does what it does well and easy.

Granted there are a few extra bells and whistles under the hood of the paid version but, is it enough for the average user? In my opinion not really. For an average user like myself who does web surfing, email, and that's about it the added layers of security will largely go unnoticed or under utilized.

Don't mistake this review though. AVG is very good software. There is a good value here but when a company gives away a version of something for free there needs to be a little more punch to get me to upgrade to a premium version."
"My review of this program is essentially the same as Norton Internet Security 2013.  It's a good anti-virus program with some performance penalties.  If you are using a laptop with a solid state drive, I would insure that the optimization feature is turned off."
"Argh... I remember being stuck with a limited selection of software that would play HD DVD (for those that remember that now dead and well orphaned product) and Blu-ray and being faced with the choice of PowerDVD and a few other products (including from a competitor of the manufacturer of this product).  In the end, well, I'd have to recommend going with a competing product *still* as it seems that Cyberlink has failed in any real effort at improving their products in any significant manner.

Let me summarize it this way -- this product is ok if you have no other choices, but if you check around just a little you'll find you do have choices and I think you'd be happier with those products rather than this one."
"Here's a sample of the horrible interface:

1. A full scan is simultaneously marked as COMPLETE and NEVER RUN.

2. To schedule a scan to run later, you have to click the ""SCAN NOW"" button.

3. The ""quick scan"" runs every day, which is annoying and interrupts work, so I find the schedule setting, and... IT IS ALREADY SET TO ""DO NOT SCHEDULE THIS SCAN"".

So it presents contradictory information, settings are hard to find, and even when you find settings they don't work.  Non-functional settings have been a problem with almost every version of Norton I have tried, and not always with the same feature.  I think one previous version would try to backup my entire hard drive automatically, despite that being turned off according to the UI."

"I have been a fan of the Quickbooks series for quite some time. Back when Windows 95 was the alternative to DOS I used to fight my boss about the benefits of Quickbooks over say, Peachtree which used to be DOS only. Move ahead to now and I don't think I would recommend this package to anyone. The overall functionality is there. The thing that really chafes me is the way they dangle ""add ons"" that you must purchase. Why? Its because they know the average user does may not need payroll. Fine, then don't ship it with the software. Instead, make this addon an inexpensive purchase, NOT a subscription. That is highway robbery. Sticking it to the small business that may use this software is underhanded and petty.

Pros:

>> Easy to use
>> Low learning curve
>> Basics are plenty for most small businesses

Cons:
<< Subscription service to add payroll & more
<< Feel ripped off when using this software like they just want to dip into your pockets every time you use it.

Overall if you just need a basic accounting software for your business you may be better off looking somewhere else. This package is ""very"" basic and you will need to add a good deal more subscriptions or addons to get it to the level of some higher priced initially, but overall better software packages.

Thank you for reading my review."
"Corel PaintShop is a pleasant surprise.  I take a lot of pictures on vacations and most of them are pretty easy to clean up. The ones that give me the most trouble are from our scuba diving trips. Close ups are usually ok, but taking landscapes and pictures of my wife usually end up looking like I took them with a blue filter on the camera or they are just really washed out. Using White Balance really helps clean them up fast.  As an armature photographer I think this is much easier to use than Photoshop, and has all the power I need.  All in all it is a great software package."
"As Andy Warhol once said, in the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes. I don't think he expected us to be doing our own production work, however.

This software lets you start with your own video, and then cut, paste, crop, enhance, tweak, title, correct, voice over, scene transition, etc.  The program is quite usable once you get used to the ""rooms"" paradigm, and there's also a Wizard version that is even simpler, if you're willing to give up some creative control, as well as a simple slideshow maker. There is also a QR link to download a free (simpler) version of the video editor for tablets. (That version has more handholding, and will be a good starting point if you are new to this kind of program, and also own a tablet to run it on). Unlike the video editors I grew up with, this one will access your system's camera and microphone directly, so you can also record video/audio on the fly. Cool.

In addition to the Power Director video editor, there are other applications and add-ons associated with this package, and here the confusion starts. Do you want Delux, Ultra, Ultimate, or Ultimate Suite? ""Delux"" is apparently the basic  version, with some kinds of video formats not supported. ""Ultra"" and ""Ultimate"" include a simple stand-alone audio editor, called ""WaveEditor 2"", but Ultimate has more add-ons in the package (listed below). ""Ultimate Suite"" has a more sophisticated audio editor, called ""AudioDirector,"" as well as color grading software - ""ColorDirector.""

PowerDirector Ultimate includes the following additional features over PowerDirector Ultra, all nicely presented on the Cyberlink website -

- NewBlue Video Essential 1, and NewBlue Video Essential 5 (all the various packages are at http://www.cyberlink.com/products/partner-plug-ins/partner-newblue_en_US.html)

- NewBlue Video Titler Pro v1 (http://www.cyberlink.com/products/partner-plug-ins/partner-newblue-tp1_en_US.html)

- proDAD Adorage Filter (http://www.cyberlink.com/products/partner-plug-ins/partner-prodad_en_US.html - I'm only getting one effect showing up - it's not clear which items are actually included)

- CyberLink Wedding Pack (http://www.cyberlink.com/products/creative-design-packs/wedding-1_en_US.html)

- CyberLink Holiday Pack 5 (http://www.cyberlink.com/products/creative-design-packs/holidays-5-pdr_en_US.html)

Ultimate Suite also includes a Travel Pack, and perhaps some other features I haven't figured out yet. Which version is best?  Well, were you the kid who had to have the 64 box of crayons, or were you satisfied with the 24?  Me too. Would I get the 96 or the 150 box? Not clear. But I wish there was a less confusing way to decide - maybe one ""suite"" that had everything, and one basic package that came with a coupon for your choice of two upgrade packs. (Just a suggestion folks, but really)."
"We have been using Trend Micro for four years and have been pleased with it.  I installed this on my new laptop with no problems, and I am not a computer geek.  When I tried to install it on my desktop, I had problems.  I couldn't install it using the software, but went to Trend Mirco's site and was able to install it from my account there.  This product is a great deal since it can be used on three PC's."
"I used both webroot's spysweeeper and PC tools Spyware Dr.

Last year it seemed they were close in detections.

Now Spyware dr is giving spysweeper a daily smackdown.

Spyware  dr consistently finds things that my other AV and/or anti-malware scanners miss.

At work, I run 2 anti-malware scanners for precisely the conclusion someone might draw from the above writeup.

No two scan tools are the same in detection capabilities.

Unlike anti-virus scanners, you CAN have more than one anti-malware detectors installed on a PC; (but you would probably want to limit things to only having one software pkg running in the background, in realtime).

And if by chance they WERE close in detection abilities; then there is a good chance that the actual REMOVAL of the detected ""pests""
might go well for one product, while another product fails miserably at removing detection ""pests"".

I will say that even spyware dr had some problems in removing an ActiveX trojan and I had to use JV powertools to remove the registry infections, at the registry level.

May 1st,2009 Update:

Incredible detection and removal in an  ACTUAL, real world circumstance just a day ago.

A co-worker got infected and gave his drive to me to clean.

I hooked it up as an external hard drive, via a USB external hard drive chassis.

I first scanned it with webroot spysweeper, then kaspersky AV and then Norton internet security 2009. Kaspersky and norton found trojans and deleted them.
[In case you are wondering, I have 3 home PCs, each with a different internet security suite.
But all with a secondary malware  scanner, which is Spyware Dr.]

I was ready to give it back, but since I was not going to see my friend until the later, I decided to give it a final scan.
So as a final scan I used Spyware doctor.

I could not believe it.

Spyware dr found a #%^$#&  ""Rootkit"".
Plus, it removed the rootkit.

I was happy for my friend, but very unsettled that the other 3 programs did not find & delete the rootkit.
After all, how many IT techs would scan a hard drive as many times as I did, and with as big a variety of software scanners as I did?

I went ahead and did a clean install of XP on a different (new) hard drive, for my friend.
I advised him to install and update an Internet security suite before hooking up the external hard drive and importing any of his old data.

Pros:
1. excellent detection - beat out 3 other programs in an actual test.
2. good cleanup/removal ability
3. new updates either daily, or close to daily.

Cons:
It can add some extra overhead to your pc and depending on what it is scanning, can slow your pc.
Best to set up a scheduled update and scheduled scan during your off hours (like when you are sleeping)."
"First, because a lot of reviewers here seem to have some background in Spanish, I want to mention my own experience with this language. Basically, I have next to none!

I mean, as an American, I've of course encountered words like ""grande"" and ""hombre,"" but I've had almost no Spanish instruction in my life. (I did have a semester of Spanish in sixth grade, but I am 99.9 percent sure the instructor didn't actually speak Spanish, and I certainly didn't learn anything. Plus, that was two decades ago.)

I'm still working on Level 1 of this program, because I'm the mom of a very busy toddler and I also don't want to go so fast that none of what I'm learning ""sticks."" But so far, I am absolutely in love with the Rosetta Stone program.

The software (which I run on a Macbook, with absolutely no problems) is very intuitive and easy to use. There's almost no English -- just pictures and Spanish words, phrases and sentences that you quickly come to associate with one another. For example, the software says, ""Es rojo"" and you select the picture of the red object, as opposed to the blue or green or yellow one. It's almost like being in Latin America and having a very patient Spanish-speaking friend point out everything you see, again and again and again, until you learn to associate the word and the concept or object.

This method works surprisingly well for verbs and other grammatical constructions, I've found. I was really amazed at how quickly I picked up things like subject/verb agreement just from the photos and from repetition.

There is definitely a lot of repetition. Some people may find this frustrating, especially if they pick up on something very quickly and then remember it well, but it's worked well for me. I tend to grasp a concept very fast and then forget it almost immediately. But working through this program slowly seems to really be pounding Spanish into my head.

The audio companions, while probably not strictly necessary, are nice. I listen to them while I'm driving. They're mostly of the ""listen and repeat"" variety -- at least the ones I've encountered so far are -- and it helps me to try to visualize what the speaker is talking about, as a way of refreshing what I've learned."

"Product has been unavailable for some time and I was happy to find it on Amazon.  Used it for years until Thymes discontinued it. Was told this was a special ""edition"" just released last Christmas, and I hope they will do it again this year, as I will order some for gifts if it is available."
Love it and will be ording it soon for taxes. thank you for a wonderful product.
"I have always been a big fan of WordPerfect. Huge fan! It is so much nicer than Word...mostly because it does what ~I~ want it to do, not some automatic formatting crap that is a pain to work around. This is almost like having a typewriter...2 spaces STAY as two spaces...2 returns don't automatically number, etc. BUT! you have the option of many more things, manual word and letter spacing, rotating text in certain parts of the page or table if you want, etc.

However, I have been having a little trouble with it shutting down on me. Also after a few hours of working, my black cursor indicator disappears. I can still type and stuff, but it is hard to know where you are on the page. It may be because I put it on my work computer...which is old an crappy. But it is where I do most of my typing!

I will put up with it gladly though instead of having to fuss with word to type and format the way I want. I don't ever want to stop using WordPerfect!"
"I recently was running 'AVG free edition' on my Dell dual core Vista PC with 3GB RAM. Just the other day, I was attacked by a 'Trojan' virus, which AVG could not apparently get rid of (I even tried a full system scan). I still kept getting pop-up messages regarding the virus and a new tab I never had before. I also had audio advertisements running without my choosing at times, even when I closed my browser! Talk about annoying. So I decided to can 'AVG' and go with Norton 360, which I downloaded. It seems to be working in some regards, but a full system scan took nearly 6 hours (5 hours, 50 minutes to be exact)! Is this normal?

UPDATE 6/26: Today, Norton 360 keeps asking me to re-start my computer, each and every time I turn it on!  2 starts every time I want to use my PC?  Are you kidding me?!  Ridiculous!  It also did not stop yet another Trojan virus, which it cannot 'quarantine' or get rid of.  Now I have 2 tabs i've never had before, and the ad music keeps playing again, even when i'm logged off of my 'Explorer' browser.  And 'Windows Security Center' does not work at all.  It has been disabled (I get a message stating that 'the security center can't be started').  I cannot turn it on or off, which includes updates and firewall settings too!  In addition, many applications run very slowly, or don't run at all when Norton is updating automatically!  You would think a 'full system scan' would have taken care of my issues.  There is a reason this crappy security suite is 63% off (at time of download)! What a waste of 32 dollars.  I am going to try Kaspersky, and hope it fares better than this."
"First, i am no video expert...photography is my 1st hobby.  But we all shoot video, and often need tools to make a final presentation.  Its a very complex field vs. single frame photography.  So Newbs, beware...there is many lower end, or even freebie programs to get started.
I have used many video editors in the past...and damn, this Pin. 19 is quite intense, hard to fathom all this at such a reasonable price point.  Most of it is beyond what I would ever use, at least at the start.  Like, most of these programs which keep evolving over time, they are very feature rich, so newbs are often overwhelmed.
I am most curious so far about 4k video....which so far, worked well.  What I really want to start exploring is 3d video!  But, upon initial review, I have a lot of studying to do, as 3d adds another layer of complexity to video.  But the fact at this price point, 3d editing is possible, well, I will slowly learn and explore this new medium.
The user interface is good, assuming u have a somewhat of a graphics background, as many of these programs share some common interfaces.  Hard for me to ding a product with this much power, at this price point.  I appreciate some of the other reviewers comments, as I have learned from those as well."
works great.

"I couldn't rename my pre-Leopard files and can't delete a pre-Leopard file without typing my password each time. I'm typing this while waiting about one half hour for help from India where Apple now seems to be going for it's help-desk. I've been passed off to three people and am now waiting for the 4th.
The system reaction time seems slower than Tiger despite the promotional literature. I should have passed  on Leopard."
"I'm very mixed on whether this should be a 3 star or 4 star review.  I've decided to give it a 3 star review because, frankly, I had to keep googling youtube videos to figure out how to do things that should be very easy to do.  Once you figure out how to do it, then you realize how powerful the editor is.

This year I've created projects with Cyberlink PowerDirector and iMovie.  Not surprisingly, when you just want to quickly put together some clips to post to facebook, iMovie wins.  Next up, I like power director, but it is only slight ahead of Pinnacle Studio.

One really nice thing is that it has a lot of built in transitions and effects.  I found the export menu to be one of the easier menus I've used.

I liked the clip editor screen quite a bit (after I youtubed a tutorial).  However, I used color and brightness correction on a snow video (sledding) and the final result didn't look very good.  It really struggled to properly correct the snow.

One thing I really didn't like is that the effects / transitions labeled ""GPU"" wouldn't preview render for me at all.  This is very annoying, especially since I have a Radeon r9 270x GPU.  I also pulled up the GPU monitor when doing export and as far as I could tell it never even used the GPU.  I do have an i4770 CPU, which it pegged at 100%. So, as far as I can tell from reading the documentation, you have to have a Nvidia GPU or you will not get any advantage from your GPU.

All in all, this product didn't leave me especially unhappy with it or very excited about it. In other words, I don't see much of anything that makes it stand out as an obvious winner."
"I was a little nervous to try this after reading some of the negative reviews but for me at least it wasn't too hard to get up and running on my Windows 7 based system.  You connect the RCA cable to your VCR and the USB cable to your computer.  The software install took a few minutes.  You can also hook it up to your stereo to record audio off of a turn table, though I haven't tried that yet.

I've taken a few old VHS movies through the ""Easy Wizard Mode"" onto DVD.  It will also burn Blu-ray if you have a High Def camera.  You can burn VHS onto a Blu-Ray but there's not much reason too.  That accomplished all I wanted to do.  I put the DVD into my player and it worked like a charm.  The VHS format was crummy, and I found that those DVDs did not look very good on my 55"" Plasma.  However watching them on a 38"" LCD was fine.  If you want good quality video you're just going to have to spring for an HD version of your movie.  But if you've got a lot of old VHS tapes of movies that you'd like to keep around for watching and you are willing to be flexible about the video quality this is an fairly easy way to get it done."
"Disappointed with this version of Turbo Tax, and had to end up going to a tax professional to have my return done. Why would I need to spend $40 for the deluxe version of Turbo Tax in order to get my tax return done? I think Turbo Tax needs to be upfront about what features you'll get with the basic versus the deluxe. I always use the 1040EZ to file my taxes.  I'd rather spend the extra couple of dollars to get the features included with the deluxe version than waste money. Luckily, I got this software to try out."
"I'VE CONTINUED TO DOCUMENT THE SORRY SAGA OF MY EXPERIENCES WITH THIS PRODUCT UNDER THE HEADING OF QUICKEN DELUXE 2009. CHECK FOR EVEN MORE BAD NEWS THERE ...

A forced/hostage upgrade from Quicken 2005. You ""have"" to upgrade since they've cut a deal with the financial institutions to cut off your online  access with the institutions if you don't upgrade every three years. Just as found when I was hostage upgraded in 2005 from 2002, there's nothing more than a cosmetic face-lift, no meaningful fixes/improvements -- but there's even more problems.

* Product now will not connect properly to Fidelity; no problem under 2005.

* Took forever to figure out how to turn off a ""reminder"" function ... that kept reminding me to pay bills already scheduled to be paid using the auto-pay function. 2005 did the same thing and it's not been fixed.

*You can turn off the product registration nag screen ... if you Google to find out how. Product does not have to be registered to use it.

* Un-reconciles accounts six months back every once in a while. I've been assuming that's being caused by a few bytes of bad data that occasionally comes from the financial institutions ... that the Quicken people have not properly coded so as to filter out. This bug also surfaced in 2005. Two weeks into 2008, I've seen it again already.

* You can't turn off the ""free update/revision"" nag screen unless you take the update. No such nag screen in 2005.

* When connecting, the completion screen used to show which accounts had new transactions to match and had convenient buttons next to each to take you directly to the account.  Gone in 2008. Now I have to look through every account each time to see where transactions might have been retrieved.

* Icons everywhere attempting to peddle other unwanted Quicken products. One of the 'product improvements' in 2008.

* Doesn't handle stock distributions correctly (since they were not actually paid for); keeps generating error messages when you enter the correct posting of no cost incurred. Same problem in 2005.

* Tricky screens/checkboxes/prompts that try to bait you into using/enrolling for QuickenDot services when you don't have to or need to. Users that did so now post complaints they can't undo it and that the QuickenDot server is constantly down, causing problems/delays when trying to connect to other accounts using a one-step update.

Yet another company that's grown totally complacent about product quality while wallowing in its assured-for-the-moment revenue stream. It will bite them hard in the long-run. Postings indicate similar complaining regarding the major competitor product, Microsoft Money. If history is any lesson, there's no reason to suspect that these software products will ever get better under these conditions. Some other product will have to steal their customer base before they wake up and smell the coffee.

If you are not already committed to either of those two products, take a good long look at open source software such as GNU Cash.

[Update April 15, 2008] Does now connect to Fidelity ... occasionally. When I opened the portfolio area today, the entire computer screen flashed with confusion and the product crashed. 2005 never once crashed. Still flashing but no subsequent crashes. Who knows what happened. Not me. Apparently not Quicken programmers either.

[Update July 12, 2008] Connects now more or less on regular basis. Software still flashes/flickers routinely. Also slow to load, apparently trying to read every single record into RAM, regardless of age. Pop-up screen this morning stating ""We've noticed you are not downloading your current Quicken Visa/MasterCard transactions, click here to ..."" I don't have one. Obviously a deceptive come-on intended to trick users into the application process for a Quicken credit card. Nice. Still constantly beg-screens me to take the lastest software update.

[Update October 18, 2008] Just downloaded this week's financial transactions and Quicken wiped out four months of reconciliation on one of my credit cards ... again. When Quicken goes under, I'm going to wear a pink tuxedo to the funeral."
"This product is excelent, i receeived in justig time, all OK.

"Windows ""upgrades"" are WORSE THAN USELESS.

When I had to get Windows 7 with a new computer, several programs I owned--including the rather costly Corel PhotoPaint--would not work. In other words, Microsoft essentially destroyed a couple of hundred dollars worth of software for me. The operating system has bugs too, e.g. when I try to select a default program to run a certain type of file, the ""always use this program"" box is grayed out.

Microsoft Office ""upgrades"" also are like throwing money down a sewer. The 2010 version of Excel does not do anything substantially different than the XP version, and actually has less functionality in terms of importing other kinds of files (e.g. Quattro Pro) than the XP version. The last thing I want to do is get Windows 8 or higher and then discover that Quattro Pro, which I have to use for my financial records (because I can't import the files in Excel) won't work any more. There are other problems as well, e.g. ""Search my computer"" NEVER works for the Help function in Office. It is clear that Microsoft is running on name recognition only rather than the quality of its products.

I had to buy Windows 8 with my new tablet, and it is absolute trash-much harder to even access your desktop than with Windows 7, and it keeps slamming unwanted applications onto the screen when I try to access my desktop."

"I have used McAfee (and Norton) for several years now.  This version seemed to install much more quickly than previous versions, and it installed on multiple pc's, as advertised with no problem.  In the past, my computer has been protected, the software caught trojan and other viruses before they were able to do any damage.  McAfee is consistently among the top security software for pc's.  I recommend purchasing cd's to install the software as opposed to buying online from McAfee, though.  McAfee defaults your setting to have the software automatically renew, and they already have your credit card number from your purchase.  You can't change the setting yourself, you have to make a phone call.  Very inconvenient and annoying, and the reason for only four stars.  This new version also creates a folder called the mcafee vault.  It is supposed to offer extra protection for files you direct there.  I chose not to use this, and was disappointed that the file cannot be removed, even if you don't use it, another small annoyance.  Overall recommended product."
"TREND makes an average security software lineup priced accordingly. I have not problems with this software. It does pretty much as advertised. If you want to get away from all the hype with the big name products like McAfee and Norton then this is a potential option.

It is setup to run basic/minimal security out of the box. I'm sure TREND doesn't want to overwhelm the average Windows user and increase their likely hood of getting more tech phone calls. I prefer a more robust setting with better protection. You can go in a change the settings to a more advanced setup, but this is not easy for the average user.

It was easy to install and removes any old security programs you may have on your computer that may cause a conflict with it. Modern security programs need to have complete control and don't like sharing resources with other competing programs.

I like that is comes on a usb key. CD's are so last decade now. With more and more people with broadband internet they tend to just junk up your office or get scratched. This is also nice for netbook and users without a cd/dvd drive.

Running the program did cause a few of the built-in windows security features to conflict. Windows firewall flagged up a warning as TREND's firewall was being setup. The firewall was also set to minimal protection as default. This provides virtually no protection. Make sure to change this.

Windows XP users shouldn't have many problems with this program. Be careful if your running the new Windows 7 as many people have reported that this does not run well on it."
Bought this for my daughters christmas. She loves Ihop and the first thing she wanted to do is take me to lunch. Win win!
"For some reason in all the years I've been playing these games, when it came time to pick out which title to play next I always skipped over Secret of the Scarlet Hand. I don't know why, but I always just assumed that I wouldn't like this game. Maybe it's because it's notoriously educational (and who wants a game that is like school?) or maybe it's because the previews for it aren't terribly interesting. Whatever the case, Nancy Drew has once again proved me wrong. My intuition on these games must be seriously off, because every game I'm sure I won't like ends up being one of my favorites. And this has indeed become one of my favorites of the early Nancy Drew titles. I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.

PLOT - 5/5: Nancy is hired as the Deputy Curator at a Washington, DC museum called Beech Hill. It is quite an exciting time for Beech Hill because they are preparing to open a new exhibit on the Maya, the highlight of which will be a very rare (and very expensive) artifact - a large elaborately carved stone called a monolith.

But poor Nancy just has the worst luck when it comes to vacations and dream jobs. Before she knows it, Beech Hill is robbed of one of its most beloved artifacts; a rare and unusual jade carving of the Mayan King Pacal. It seems to be related to a string of art thefts happening across the country, since in all the incidents Mayan jade artifacts were the target and a threatening red handprint was left at the scene.

I thought this plot was just wonderful. It was well thought out, thorough, and unique among other ND titles. The length was perfect; I finished it over the course of a few days. There were lots of little twists and turns that I really enjoyed. It was interesting and intriguing, and very educational. Let me repeat that; it was VERY educational. It is set in a museum, after all. There is tons of information to take in - some of which is vital to the mystery of some of which is not. I have always loved history and am especially interested in the Maya and Aztec so this game was just my cup of tea. But if you don't like history - or aren't a big fan of plenty of reading in a ND game - this game might not be for you.

CHARACTERS - 4/5: Suspects in this game include Joanna Riggs, the curator of Beech Hill and therefore Nancy's boss, a fairly serious young woman with a history of being a bit too eager to acquire artifacts for the museum. Henrik van der Hune is the museum's resident expert in translating Mayan glyphs, so he is arguably the only person in the museum who can guess an artifact's true value. Then there is Taylor Sinclair, an art dealer located in DC, who often does business with Joanna and appears to be unusually concerned over the museum's safety. Finally, there is Alejandro del Rio, a Mexican ambassador who accuses Beech Hill and other museums like it of flat-out stealing artifacts that rightfully belong to Mexico.

Phone friends include Bess and George, the Hardy Boys, and Franklin Rose, who is a member of the Beech Hill board of directors and friend of Nancy's father. There are quite a few one or two time phone friends related to the plot as well.

Unfortunately, the four suspects weren't very memorable. Their personalities were not particularly well defined and there wasn't anything quirky or fun about them. Worst of all, none of them were very suspicious. Basically, no one from this cast of characters is going to be making my favorites list anytime soon. However, the previous deputy curator, Sonny Joon, seen only in notebooks he left behind at the museum, was absolutely hilarious and his notebooks were a delightful comic relief. I hear he shows up again in some of the newer titles so I'm really looking forward to that.

SETTING - 5/5: The setting was excellent. Beech Hill was very interesting and there was tons to look at inside. If it were a real museum I would definitely visit. Other places to see include Nancy's hotel room, Taylor's office, Alejandro's office, as well as some other locations that are unlocked throughout the course of the game. One thing that really blew me away was how realistic it all was. There were little things - like how could you see the exterior of every building before you entered it - that made a huge difference. It was so easy to get into the mystery because it really felt like I was there.

PUZZLES - 4.5/5: I liked the puzzles, though this game tended to repeat itself as far as puzzles go. In other words, you do the same thing a few times throughout the game. The puzzles in the museum were mostly information scavenger hunts, where Nancy would be posed with a quiz question and you would have to search the museum exhibits for the answer. That didn't bother me, but I could easily understand someone finding it tedious and too slow-paced. In hindsight this game wasn't as puzzle-heavy as some other ND titles, which worked for me as I'm not a huge puzzle fan. But the puzzles did work in seamlessly with the plot and I never felt like I was stuck doing something unnecessary just to make the game longer.

IS IT CHALLENGING? Not really. Most - if not all - of the puzzles are explained by the game, and Nancy can call her friends for hints. I did go online for help once for a game of ""chance"" that I lost maybe 20 times in a row, thinking that there might be some strategy I was missing. But it seems that the mini-game couldn't be won until you reached a certain point in the plot, which frankly was pretty frustrating to learn I had wasted all that time. Anyways, I would give it a 3 for challenge.

ENDING - 3.5/5: The ending was probably the only part of this game that really didn't impress me. Although the ending was very intense, it was just sort of awkward and didn't make a whole lot of sense. The culprit wasn't too predictable and their motive made sense. Overall the ending was underwhelming. But be warned that the ending of this game is pretty creepy, and because of it I definitely wouldn't recommend this game for young children.

FINAL SCORE:
Plot: 5
Characters: 4
Setting: 5
Puzzles: 4.5
Challenge: 3
Ending: 3.5
= 25, divided by 6 = 4.16 rounded to 4 stars"

"Whether you're a hobbyist or a professional, Corel Draw Graphics Suite X6 provides impressive bang for the buck. The primary programs in the suite are CorelDraw for page layout and vector based drawing, and Photo Paint for digital image editing and retouching. In addition to these two main programs, the Graphics Suite also includes CorelCapture, Duplexing Wizard, Bitstream Font Navigator, and an Extras folder with clip art, digital images and fonts.

The installation disk drop downs allow you to install as much or as little of the suite as you need or want. One section is for the programs that comprise the suite itself, a separate section is for the extras - clip art, photos, fonts, etc. (Even the fonts are available with a drop down that lets you deselect some that you might not use.)

Corel has provided a generous amount of documentation, reference material and instruction to make it easier to learn and use these programs including a 300+ page manual and plenty of tutorials.

"Back when we owned only one computer, McAfee was the anti-virus software we used.  After my husband became a certified system engineer and our home network grew to rival that of some small companies, McAfee remained the brand we counted on.  We still do.  This is an excellent suite of anti-viral and utility programs and a great value for money.  In a word -- well, two words -- buy it."

All that this program download does is make one doubt that even a ""New PC"" is just loaded with all kinds of malware of which is just their view point.

"This software is EXCELLANT and I've used it for 2 years now. None of that bogging down nonsense like I had with Norton. And, it's caught everything that ever came at it! Great product."
"I hope this review serves to clarify some of the complaints that people have posted regarding Office 2008.

Preface:
After being disappointed with Leopard 10.5 -which I also reviewed- I kept using Tiger. When finally 10.5.2 arrived I began using it. It fixes many Leopard bugs. According to some websites, at least 130 bugs have been fixed. This is important since many problems with third party software may be related to other software or to the operating system. For example, Apple is aware of problems with its Sync services and Core Image. Also, some bugs have existed for many years and have not been fixed, such as a potential bug when moving data to an external device.
Keeping these issues in mind I did a completely clean install of Leopard 10.5.2 in a brand new hard drive.
I installed Office 2008 as well as the available upgrade to 12.0.1.

First Impressions:
Some useful features have been added, such as Elements Gallery, which may be a time saver for many people. Some features have been removed, such as VBA, and this may be a deal-breaker for many people.
I'm keeping Office 2004 in a separate partition in order to use previous versions of Word and Excel.
At the same time, I can still use the new versions when I don't need the VBA features.
Lack of VBA support was announced well over a year ago, so this came as no surprise.

Starting up:
Each program took approximately 10 seconds to launch. Office seems to have a peculiar way of handling fonts, though, and launch times can be greatly effected. After installing another program that installed more fonts, and installing Extensis Fusion to manage my fonts, launch times for Office programs was approximately 150 (one hundred and fifty) seconds, instead of the original 10 (ten) seconds.
Now it takes about a minute to launch these programs. In all fairness, the slow down is partly caused by third party software.

Overall (and very brief)  impressions:
PowerPoint works with presentations that used to crash my 2004 version. The 2004 version was practically unusable for me. This was a welcome upgrade.

Excel works fine and the Elements Gallery is a good addition. It lost VBA support and the Abalysys Toolpack. I kept the 2004 version as well.

Word seems to be a solid upgrade. Some third party templates do not work with 2008, so I kept Word 2004.

Entourage works very well. I had to re-select the folders that I had set up for my rules, and re-apply categories to my folders. Syncing with Address Book always adds many duplicate contacts. Fortunately there are scripts to deal with this inconvenience. Hyperlinks still require a workaround, as mentioned by another reviewer. I would not rate Office with 1-star solely based on that issue.

Expression Media used to be called iView MediaPro, iView Multimedia, and iView many years ago. It used to be a $25 shareware program when I first used it. Eventually it became quite expensive so I never upgraded until I received this version. So far I'm happy with it. It has worked fine for cataloging thousands of fonts and pictures, and I'm entitled to a free upgrade when version 2 comes out.

Price:
There are free Office alternatives, as well as iWork. I( still prefer Microsoft Office for the most part. The only exception may be Keynote 4.
Microsoft offered a substantial discount under the names of The Technology Guarantee Program and the Super Suite Deal. Additionally, for one day they offered a $[...] rebate. So users could get the Mac Special Media Edition for approximately $[...]-$[...] with these offers.
Had it not been for the offer, I would have stayed with Office 2004. I've used Office 2008 for a few days, every day, and so far have encountered no problems.

Overall I'm satisfied with the upgrade. Support has been great, both by Microsoft and the MVP people. Search their forums and you'll find a lot of useful advise."
"Try different security software since all manufacturers offer free trials (most 30 days, though Norton's is 15), and no security software works great on all computers.  You can then purchase the software you like elsewhere at a lower cost compared to the manufacturer and type in the security key.

I am giving stars based on how well it protects and what are the odds of the product working well.  On the plus side Norton is bullet proof, and I can attest to that since we use it at work (it also has advantages in a network environment).  Five star protection.

On the down side, I do not like Norton since while not bad anymore, it is not fast and efficient.  But my biggest problem is that I think it is locked down so tight that it too easily causes side affects.

I tried it at home and I could not get it to work at all, which is OK since like I said, no security software works perfectly on all computers.  However I could not remove it.  I tried standard uninstall, a utility program on the Norton site, and standard windows methods including registry deletions.  I finally booted up in command mode and deleted the program that way.  However I then lost network connections and tried for three hours before I gave up and did a total new install of Windows.  It must have thought I was a virus.  We have problems at work which we solve with new installs also.  Based on my expereince and all that I hear, I feel odds are good it will not work for you hence two stars.

Like I said, nothing works well on all computers I also evaluated Trend Micro and BitDefender on two of my home computers, a super fast computer and my kids old 1.4ghz clunker, both XP computers built by me.  BitDefender was outstanding on my kids virus/malware magnet, but somehow either it or I turned off protection on my computer (granted it warned me with two big red X's and I was too dense to look that up).  The 2007 version of Trend Micro does not work on my kid's computer.  I hated the McAfee 2007 interface so I never tried the 2008 version.

Bottom line - TrendMicro, BitDefender, Norton, Panda, and others offer great protection.  Pick one and see if it works great.  If you do not have Norton, try one of the others first since I think others have a better chance of working.  I decided on TrendMicro, bought the software from Amazon much cheaper then straight from TrendMicro, and will be inserting the security key into the evaluation copy."
very helpfull magazine
"I love this server software! Setting it up didn't take too long. The installation took a while but after that, it was smooth sailing. Having a lot of computer-related knowledge in server and internet security, it was easy to get all my network PCs and Macs connected and be able to access documents off the server from any machine."
So far it is doing everything I need it to do.  Time will tell how well it plays with others when I send letters and trty to open and edit from other word processors.
"I have used Kaspersky Internet Security programs for several years.  During that time I tried Norton, McAfee, and recently bitdefender.  In every case one of my three computers crashed and I had to recover the operating system and all the junk programs that came with my computer - and uninstall them - and re-install all my good programs.  (I did have back-ups of my data and photographs - so I only lost two days work fixing things.)

I'm not going to go into all the details of this program.  Others have covered this better than I could.  I just want to make it known that I think Kaspersky simply is the safest and best, and I wouldn't surf any website without the latest update.  Kaspersky Internet Security 2011 is as it says on the box: ""Everything You Need to Stay Safe.""

Just one more thing: I also use Windows Washer to get crap off my computers and keep them running full speed.  Kaspersky programs don't bother with Internet clutter or other non-threats, and neither do the other security programs.

Surf Safe - Surf Fast - Surf Happy"
"The main difference between the standard edition and the home & student edition, is the inclusion of the roxio secure burn (which can be used with a cd, dvd, or bluray) and ebook publisher (which supports both the kindle and nook mobi and epub formats) functions on the standard edition. The other features--including word processor, spreadsheet, slideshow creator, video, etc. are the same and the design is similar to microsoft office. It works with over sixty types of files, and most notably pdf documents can be both created and edited.

I think the standard edition is worth it because of its unique features. Unfortunately though this program can only be installed on one computer."
This is very high quality soap.  It has a wonderful scent.  It lathers well and rinses clean.  It left my skin feeling moisturized and not the least bit dried out.  It is very good soap!
"Seems to do a very good job of not allowing spyware to install, a great job of protecting your computer against viruses, trojans, etc., and has very easy to use and effective firewall at the presets/configuration.  However, it gives you scripting errors on many sub-sections, including spam control and some areas of firewall control.  I tried to do a live chat with Symantec support.  I was able to reach a tech in far less than the 15 minutes noted on their screen.  However, when I described what my problem was, I was suddenly disconnected from the live chat session.  Maybe the disconnect was just an error, but combined with the non-configurable sections of the software, the experience made me find another antivirus/firewall solution and then uninstall the product on one computer.  (I had it running on two machines.  The one it is still installed on is more modern and has 2 GB RAM...it gets the same scripting errors.)

It might be worth the current $20 being asked here (discount) to someone who never wishes to customize controls since the antivirus, etc., do work well.  But, make sure you have a relatively modern machine running XP."
a lot of great tips in this magazine from weight loss to skin care
"VERANDA reigns along with the other three most beautiful and stylish U.S. shelter magazines today: Architectural Digest, Elle Decor and House Beautiful. What I like about VERANDA is the photography and rooms dominate and the text takes a supporting role.  The magazine features many full-page and double-page spreads of gorgeous rooms with not a lot of text interrupting.  Design is one of the fields in which you can learn by just studying a room in detail to get a sense of the scale, proportion, balance of texture and light and shadow etc.

You are training your eye in what the best designers find beautiful.  A full and double-page spread allows you to do that better than smaller, choppier photos. It's great to have more visual, less words in which the rooms triumph. More to see--less to read. There's enough text in VERANDA to get into the designers'/homeowners' minds. VERANDA'S lush heavy paper stock is a joy, too, and increases the aesthetic experience.  The photos of the rooms look spectacular on it.

VERANDA features eclectic styles and locations.  This month, for example, the magazine showcases a townhouse in Georgetown, a Park Avenue apartment, a Parisian pied-a-terre, a Florida ocean-front home and a Normandy-inspired Atlanta home along with a Cotswold garden. There's a mix of styles from Provencal antiques to Art Deco to a soft, tailored modern. It's a monthly infusion of visual beauty and grace. (As an aside: I love buying my shelter magazines through Amazon as I've been able to get great subscription prices and track my subscriptions so I don't miss a single issue, which is helpful when you subscribe to lots of magazines.)

Under new editor Dara Caponigro's vision, VERANDA magazine sings and soars."
I am a loyal supporter of Norton products - never had any issue Nortons did not take care of
This software has premium version previously called Norton 360 premier and worked the best prior to 2015. However the system got changed to Norton standard security and cost $20 more than in the past.
Utilitarian.
Always a delight to have Amazon deliver a surprise gift card to a family member in the least time expected. THANK YOU SO MUCH
"Gotta love the Taco Bell gift card. It's simple to use, makes paying faster and it's from a restaurant I love."
Too many times they refer you to the website to get a recipe or additional news.  Why buy the magazine if they do that?
"Movie Studio 13 is incredibly intuitive and its user interface is pretty ""standard."" By ""standard,"" I mean if you've ever used the free Microsoft Movie Maker (that comes with Windows) and are familiar with basic multi-track movie editing and timeline concepts, you'll have no problem picking up Movie Studio. It's. That. Easy.

If you've never used a movie editing software before, start with the free Microsoft Movie Maker and seek out free tutorials on that free (albeit advert-laden) video site. THEN, come back to Movie Studio 13. The basic concepts are the same -- so you'll have no problem transitioning to Movie Studio.

Movie Studio 13 Suite is of course A LOT more powerful than Movie Maker. The Suite comes with Movie Studio 13 (for editing movies), Sound Forge Audio Studio 10 (for editing sound files), DVD Architect Studio 5.0 (for creating and authoring DVD/Blu-ray Discs), and Acid Music Studio 10 (for creating soundtracks for your movie -- includes 1 GB of high quality sounds/music you can mix to your heart's content). So, you see, Movie Studio 13 Suite contains a very powerful and complete suite of tools to enable you to produce PROFESSIONAL-grade videos.

If you're debating whether you should get&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sony-Movie-Studio-13/dp/B00I3MTI9Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sony Movie Studio 13</a>&nbsp;(basic stripped down version),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sony-Movie-Studio-13-Platinum/dp/B00I3MSBC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sony Movie Studio 13 Platinum</a>&nbsp;(a cut above the basic version), or this version of Sony Movie Studio (Sony Movie Studio Suite 13), I'd strongly recommend you swing for Sony Movie Studio Suite 13. Dollar for dollar, you get a lot more for what you pay when you buy the Suite version of Movie Studio.

Some features that I love about Sony Movie Stuidio 13:

+ Fully Customizable Workspace
The Workspace contains the following panels that you can optionally turn on or turn off:  Explorer, Trimmer, Master Bus, Video Preview, Project Media|Transitions, Video FX, Media Generators, Device Explorer. To do so, go to View/Window and select Explorer|Trimmer|Master Bus|Video Preview|Project Media|Transitions|Video FX|Media Generators|Device Explorer. Each panel is resizable and can be rearranged to suit your preferences.

+ Easy And Intuitive User Interface
You can drag and drop your resources (video clips, sound files, images, etc) right from Windows explorer into the tracks.

+ Easily Apply Effects (To One Or More Tracks At A Time)
You can Link and Unlink each track (e.g. Video, Audio, Music) and apply Fade in, Fade Out, transitions, and other effects to all tracks all at the same time (Ctrl-click to select each track). Similarly you can perform other operations like splitting, cuting/copying/pasting multiple tracks at the same time.

+ Make All Or Part Of Your Video
Movie allows you to rendering (or make) all or PART of your video into WMV, MOV, MPEG-2, MP4, or AVCHD files. To do so, select a region, go to Make Movie, and check Render Loop Region Only. I find the option to render only part of the movie immensely useful because I often find myself debating whether to include a particular sound or movie clip. With the option to render only part of the project, I can make quick changes at a later time by either incorporating or omiting elements in the final cut.

+ Movie Studio supports 4K videos
4K videos are ultra high definition videos FOUR TIMES the resolution of 1080p/Full HD movies. When 4K videos become the de facto standard for high-definition videos, you know you'll be ready.

---
Movie Studio 13 Suite is a superior movie editing software that's equipped to help you produce professional-grade videos WITH EASE. I really, really love it.

If you're new to Movie Studio or if you're trying to decide if the new Movie Studio 13 Suite is worth the upgrade, I'd recommend you download and install the 30-day free trial of the programs that comprise the Movie Studio Suite (Movie Studio Platinum, DVD Architect Studio, Sound Forge Audio Studio, and ACID Music Studio). These are available for download at ""sonycreativesoftware com-download-trials-moviestudiopp"" (replace the space with ""."" and each ""-"" with ""/"" to reconstitute the Web address). You have 30 days to try out the programs to see for yourself if the Movie Studio Suite is worth purchasing."
"I'm a big fan of Norton Antivirus the past few years.  Slim, low profile and gets the job done.  Norton's changed the product line and merged Norton Antivirus and Internet Security.  Big mistake.

This product covers five devices, but most people don't need it for five systems.  At $80 a pop that's a crazy expensive product.  The mobile product line is deceptive.  The iOS version doesn't offer any malware protection (apple does that).  They offer a lost phone finder, which is built into the OS anyway.  I didn't test the Android version, but at least that version offers some malware protection"
I was able to download this software easily. I like being able to use all the Office software that I am used to. Thanks!.
"I currently run Norton 360 on all of my computers, and have loved it, so when this upgraded backup came out, I was excited. I have been running Norton products for many years, and they all work seamlessly, and the latest versions are even more outstanding than the previous, so I figured that this would follow suit.

Not so, at least for me.

At first, I tried to backup my basic photos, but realized that 25 gB doesn't go very far when you have a decade of photos to save.  (I have 90 gB!)  So, I decided to back up my documents...

When I ran it, it conflicted with my Norton Antivirus, and I had to call Norton Customer Support.  They walked me through a process where I had to delete one of my computer's backup through the Antivirus program to make it work.  I was told that I could just re-add it later and run a complete back up...this computer is my boyfriend's, and doesn't have a tremendous amount of data, so I didn't worry about that...

They walked me through the process of setting up the back up, but even with their help, it didn't work.  The could not figure out what the problem was, either.  It shows that I have ""increased"" backup through the Norton 360, but it's not accessible.  Crazy.

Top that off--we cannot get the deleted computer back onto the system where it backs up his data.  The Antivirus is still there, but it refuses to complete a back up.  NO clue why.  Customer Service doesn't know, either.

So, perhaps if you don't currently run a Norton product, it will work.  But for me, running 360, it conflicts at some level that is confusing to everyone involved.

I'm really disappointed..."
"I switched from Norton IS back in 2004 and thought I would try PC-Cillin back then.  I gave it an OK rating based on some missing parts in PC-cillin internet security 2004.

Now however, it appears as though PC-cillin has the complete package and the memory footprint is still way below the other guys!

The 2 biggest features from 2004 are the ability to block URL's by type (i.e., guns, hate, adult) etc.  In the 2004 version you had to manually input each URL that you wanted blocked.  Finally! what a great upgrade.

The next most impressive upgrade is the WI-FI alarm for unauthorized uses on your network.  I love it!  I've often wondered if my network was getting leeched and now I will know for sure.  After a few clicks you can ""trust"" or ""untrust"" a device and make it so it will not be able to connect.

This years product seems to be a little more aggressive in the spyware category so that is also a bonus.

I was a very loyal Norton user 2 years ago and now I couldn't be happier I switched.  This product does it all and at about half the use of resources compared to Norton.

Well worth the upgrade if you have WI-FI, a network, or just want the latest and greatest."
must have if you are dealing with cheap attorneys who do not buy Microsoft programming.
I like how it is a well made full size Christmas card. Plenty of room to write a sentiment. The gift card is securely attached inside so no worries of it moving about or falling out.
"Very nice magazine one of my prefered,"
"I've used windvd for a lot of years, mainly because it is well-behaved and seems to play the wide variety of media that I want to play without complaint.  This version is no different.  I'm using this both on win xp and vista and have had no problems on either platform.

One thing that I really dislike about this version however are the controls.  Everyone is familiar with vcr-style controls.  Play, pause, stop, fast forward, fast reverse, and skip to next/prev chapter.  So why dork with that?  *boggle*  But no, Coral decided that it would somehow improve the interface to remove the fast forward/fast reverse buttons and combine that functionality with the chapter forward and back.  The net result is that it is a lot harder to use, and much less intuitive."
"I found NXT2 to be a functional and easy to use tool to capture, edit and produce video and music.  The interface is simple and intuitive.  So much so that I accomplished video editing without a glance at the help feature.  And the overhead on system resources is not bad.  I installed NXT2 on a dual core Intel processor laptop that is 5 years old and running Windows 7  it works just fine editing video.

But for the price point, I much prefer Cyberlink Media Suite Ultra.  I am running that on my desktop computer and it has way more features.  In addition, Cyberlink is a much better media player that even works with NAS devices."
Just what I wanted and it arrived early
"TTax2011 Deluxe (Federal + State) works great for me, as have TTax Deluxe versions over the past decade. I highly recommend this software especially if your tax return involves complications (NOL, passive gains & losses, depreciation, AMT, etc. -way too complicated thanks to the Congressional Boneheads who have made tax preparation a living Nightmare by passing stoopid tax code changes over the past century - can you spell Flat Tax?)."
"Thank You, I only wish it was more affordable."
"This is a cute story of a town that was stripped of all its colors by a villian named Dr. Dull. Dot and Dash enlist the help of pencil and friends to help catch up to Dr. Dull and restore the town's colors. Throughout the story the reader can select a picture to have it respond or on words to help sound out letters. There is a pause in the story (about every 3-4 mins)called game time, where the reader can respond to questions about the story line, play some games, word recognition by choosing the word that is spoken, letter recognition and drawing, ect. My 4 and a half year old son absolutely loves this game and I was happy that there was enough interaction to keep him from being bored. highly recommended for preschool to first grades. Excellent educational game as well!"
I love this lotion.  It has a light clean smell to it.  Putting it on then adding a little of spray of perfume gives you a smell that brings lots of compliments.
Perfect gift option for the person who always eats out
"I'm reviewing the dried lavender blossoms. The scent is wonderful, so long as you like the scent of lavender -- and I do. I mix this with some dried flower petals and use it as potpourri in the restroom. It's not an immediately overwhelming scent, but when you walk into the room, it smells very nice. In the fall, I'm going to mix it with some ground cloves.

I'd give this five stars if it were just a bit less expensive. It's not overpriced, but it's not a steal, either. Overall, though, I'm happy with it."
Good magazine!
I love this hair cream! It has a nice subtle scent that isn't overpowering and it is very lightweight.
"Good program, as always. Been using this brand since the late 90's, Don't know how anyone can have a problem downloading it. It was a breeze this time."
"I ordered this magazine (Mens Journal) through Amazon June 19th, 2015 for a bargain price. I just received my first (September-2015) issue (August 7, 2015) which took a month and a half.  I found the magazine to have many interesting articles and departments.  I especially enjoyed reading Style & Design 2015, Secrets of a secret agent by Josh Eells and The lethal thrills of BASE jumping by Phil Klay.

Other departments include: Record book, four-day week-end, adventure, travel, dispatch, food, spirits, fashion and essay.  I also enjoyed the health & fitness section explaining the facts about eating red meat. The last word column was also interesting with an interview with Merle Haggard. This magazine is aimed obviously at the young professional man who likes cars, tech tools and adventure hobbies.

If you are into fashion, cars, high tech tools and adventure you should check out this mens magazine.
Rating: 4 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Pro-Systems Combatives Vol. 1,2)."
"Had no problems whatsoever with this software. Was easy to update and did taxes quickly filed and got approved by IRS within 24 hours. Do have to pay $20 for efile of state taxes. Federal efile is free with code supplied on CD sleeve. I don't see any difference with turbo tax, except that with H&R block, audit support is free. I can't remember if I had to pay to efile state taxes with Turbotax last year. Anyhow, H&R block software is a very good alternative to Turbotax - the reason I bought it is because is cheaper than Turbotax and had used H&R block tax software before and had no problems then either. I don't remember why I bought Turbotax last year - I think it had better reviews and I had some really complicated estate stuff last year. This year H&R block got better reviews in some places that Turbotax."
"Chock full of articles and plenty of tips on the weigh watchers diet. Many testimonials and several easy to prepare recipes
Would  buy again. Good magazine but not great."
"I like Norton Utilities for a thorough cleanup of my hard drives.  Be careful to watch your settings on installation or you might find some browsing history that you would have liked to keep gone.

A reliable, reasonably priced product with a long track record."
Can't beat an Amazon gift card for any occasion
I have used Norton products for a long time. Bought the renewal cut and pasted the key on 3 computers. No problems. I Echo the advise of waiting till the day before to buy as you will lose whatever time is left on your original subscription
"I've used Trend Micro's products for years and have been very satisfied! No issues to report and highly recommend it!
Even though I am a power user, I love the feeling of turning on my PC and knowing my security definitions are already up to date...in the cloud."
"Great ingredients, but didn't agree with my skin"
"Should have listed to the other reviews. Have been using TurboTax for over a decade but the product has gone to the dogs. Will not be using next year, I can promise you that."
"First of all, you don't need to risk you money on this software. They offer full function version for 30-day trial. Corel has a 30-day satisfaction guarantee, but that is for purchase made directly from them only. So, try before you buy.

Currently, I am using ScanSoft's paperport software for following manipulations:
(1) To combing multiple documents into a single PDF file. Or remove/extract pages from a multi-page PDF file.
(2) Rotate page(s) of PDF files.

My intention of using Corel Fusion is to convert PDF files into editable documents.

The Goods:
(a) Easy to install and does an excellent job of converting documents to PDF files. The software allows me to open multiple PDFs, drag and drop certain pages among them, and then recombine them. The drag-and-drop assembly feature is excellent and easy to use.
(b) I don't have to go through the trouble of opening up a file. I can simply drag the file or document into the program.
(c) I can convert a batch of files into PDF instead of doing it one by one.

The Annoying:
(a) It does NOT come with any owners manual, not even on the installation disk!
(b) The speed of file saving is slow. Also, the editing speed is slow. My PC has Intel iCore-7 with 12G memory.
(c) Corel Fusion can only convert PDF documents into Word or SpreadSheet.
(d) Don't try to fill in a PDF blank form with Fusion, as this is not a What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get program. Forms that appear fine on the screen will not print out correctly.
(e) Corel Fusion uses heavy compression with no user control on the image quality. Be careful if you intend to include graphics or pictures in your PDF files.

The Bads:
(a) It does convert PDF file into Word document. But tables doesn't work and bullets has problems. All the text is there, but the formatting is gone.
(b) It does not allow you to click on a text filed to edit it. To cut and paste text objects, you'd better do it in Word, not in Corel Fusion.
(c) Corel Fusion provides comment boxes with large border for me to add comments, paragraph, or a signature. However, it's extremely difficult to neatly position the comment boxes in the document.

All in all, at this bargain price, Corel PDF Fusion is a good choice for people want to combine pages into a PDF file, extract pages from PDF files, or rotate pages in a PDF file.

However, if your need is to convert PDF files into editable files, you might need to find a better alternative."
"One for being a new OS and one for being a successor OS. As a new paradigm, I'd give it a 5. As a successor to Win7? Not even a 2. It's a fork of the OS family - not an advancement. You would think MS would have learned this. Every other release sucks. Perhaps that's by intent - a learning experience that users will pay to vent about. MS then collects the information and uses it to produce a working OS.

Thus, Win3.11 leads to NT3.5 which in turn leads to NT4 and then WinME/2000 to Vista (oh wait, two failures in a row!) to Win7 (the big winner since NT4) and now, Win8.

If you're a touch user or a tablet user or a new user or a user who just wants a computer for social media interaction and some document management plus photo manipulation, congrats. Win 8 is for you. Once you figure it out. Apps for you to buy and MS to sell you and make money with. Applications to do real work. A desktop for that occasional use - once you know where it is.

But if you're a dev or a power user of any kind. Wow. No way. Win 7 or perhaps a general move to Mac. Sure, you'll lose a lot of software and the software you do get will most likely be a generation behind, but you'll have superior hardware and a better interface.

Come on MS. Release Win8 for the masses. We get that. Then release Win8Power or Win8Pro or Win8Real. Whatever. Don't make things like the desktop and multi-tasking and the start menu afterthoughts. Don't make me buy Apple.

So - are you old? Don't care about computers outside the love you'd give a toaster? Then Win8 is for you.

Are you a computer user instead of an app user? Then Win8 is a mess. Just a hot mess. Stick with Win7 and wait for Win9. Pray that they learn their lesson and don't drink their own kool aid. And if they do? Well, it'll give you time to save up for that MacBookPro you want. Or iMac 27""."
"Generally happy with HR Block - much cheaper than TurboTax if you have an S corp - but no efile for state which is costly for me, and some quality problems - support has been ok.  I've used it for years and will continue."
"Spa Parties and T-shirts that say ""Delish"" are very much a part of Rachael's magazine complete with pullout recipe cards and travel features. The recipe cards all have shopping lists on the back, so you can grab the cards and head to the grocery store. There is also a handy recipe index organized by categories at the end of the magazine.

The Kids recipe section encourages young cooks to participate in family meals. This issue had a recipe for a delicious tuna salad with roasted red pepper and grape tomatoes. Just for Kids tips give ideas for how to juice a lemon and there are cute kid comments about the recipes.

Everyday with Rachael Ray embraces life and does it with a realistic flair. In the June/July issue, ideas for picnics include shopping lists and recipes for Melon Skewers with Orange-Lime Marinade. Roy Yamaguchi cooks at home with his family and offers recipes like Miso Cod with Buttered Mushrooms.

What I like most about this magazine is the realistic recipes complete with everyone cooking and enjoying life. The pictures are spontaneous and the series of pictures for the Ice Cream Cake are step-by-step heaven. Just when you think this magazine has everything you could wish for, an Everyday Menu Planner appears to give recipes and shopping lists. Grilled Shrimp with Cucumber Salad and Smoked Turkey Panini are must-have recipes for the summer. Peaches resting on a marshmallow meringue are perfect for dessert after the Baby Back Ribs with Jammy Glaze.

This is a magazine about cooks, chefs and Rachael's recipes. The ""Ask Rachael"" section gives you a chance to send in e-mails to ask Rachael about her life or to have your foodie question answered in the magazine. She also has decorating advice so now you know what to do with the shells you collected at the beach (or you could find them at Pier 1).

What is the best feature in this magazine besides the recipes? ""What is in the refrigerator of your favorite Celeb?"" I'm always intrigued.

If you collect cookbooks, there are many featured in this inspired magazine. The advertising doesn't seem to overtake the pages and is subtly blended in so it feels very natural and interesting.

Worked exactly as described. No complaints.
"This soap is great. It foams up and is so nice and milky feeling on the skin. It smells really good, but you definitely have to like the scent of Sandalwood to enjoy it."
"I hate Quicken, but it seems to be the only thing available that does the basic banking functions that it does.  I love MS Money, but they stopped supporting it several years ago, so I had to go to Quicken.  I hate it, yet, I stick with it, because I haven't found any better alternatives.  Dear Intuit - if you read this, please hire me to help you design an alternative version of this product.  I will work with your programmers until we get something that I love to use.  Then you can have your two products compete with each other.  You know there are enough people who HATE Quicken, and yet use it anyway (like me) that there is a market for it - why not capture the complete market?"
"Setup: iMac 2011 with 12 gigs of RAM (8 gigs RAM is an upgrade), Windows 7 Home Premium

I bought Fusion as I was getting tired of rebooting  from Mac to Windows and vice versa. I was also considering Parallels but Fusion was cheaper at the time I was shopping for a software. Both have high marks and good reviews so I figured any of the two will do.

It came in a box with a DVD and a USB dongle; I chose the DVD. By the way, I have already installed Windows 7 Home Premium using Apple's Boot Camp.  My only concerns were some reviewers mentioned that they have to re-enter or re-register Windows (or  maybe in my case, Autodesk's MEP 2011).  I have all the licenses but still have a bad feeling that something might go wrong and you have to deal with all the headaches of calling customer support.  Everything went smoothly.  There was a dialogue box that popped up telling me that Windows need to be registered again, but all I did was press enter and I'm all set.

The next concern is how MEP 2011 will work along with Fusion.  I see a little bit of hesitation with a few commands but almost negligible that I really don't care.  I am quite happy with the performance. Revit is another thing, I may need to do a bit more searching online to make sure it will work before I install.

Switching between Mac and Windows programs are all stitched-in into the software, quite amazing. I am working on MEP drawings running in Windows and at the same time listening to iTunes on Mac OS."
works good
"As always, well-written and interesting articles....buy it!"
"This software has SO much going on.  Theres a plethora of things you can do with it. . . which is GREAT.  .. but. . . if you're a beginner, then you're probably going to be VERY overwhelmed.  Pinnacle offers tutorials. .. but for a fee.  Fortunately, there are several very good tutorials to be found online for free.  But I have to say. . . This is not the easiest software to use for a novice.  You have to be willing to put in the time-and-effort.  Ive used it for quite simple things, and it works, but its time-consuming.  Make sure you look at the differences between the three different software options.  The Plus software (this listing) has just about everything one could need. . . but. . . . if you need 360 video, then youll need to check-out the Ultimate software."
Product worked OK except for spending hours on phone with Quicken personnel to get previously purchased state program to process; kept asking for payment again.  Over 1.5 hours with first two Quicken personnel did not accomplish anything.  Third person and third call to them resolved issue in matter of 10 minutes.
"Wordperfect Office X5 is a great alternative to the Microsoft's Office.  Most of the features and ease of use found in Microsoft's Office can be found in Wordperfect's Office at a fraction of the cost of Microsoft's version.  The major downside is that OpenOffice provides a free alternative to Microsoft's Office that almost makes this software hard to justify even at a significantly lower price than Microsoft.

**** Positive Points Include: ****
- Easy to install and use
- Comes with a tutorial
- Offers competitive performance to Microsoft's Office
- Compatible with most major Microsoft formats
- Comes with 3 use license so it can be loaded on 3 of your computers

**** Negative Points Include: ****
- Hard to justify when OpenOffice provides the same features for free

*** Overall: ***
This may be a good choice for a small business or anyone that needs a tutorial or support.  For most casual users with a bit of Office Experience, OpenOffice will easily serve their needs for free."
"A good security suite with an easy to use menu.  I've been using Norton for several years and the software has improved significantly.  It is no longer a major drain on system resources although an exception exists with MS outlook, I especially appreciate the identification of safe web sites when you are using a search engine such as google."
Bought for someones birthday . they like ruby tuesday. Its a gift card nothing negative about it
"Norton's Hotspot Privacy by Symantec is designed to keep your online activities private, to protect your logins and passwords, and provides identity-theft protection. In my experience setting it up it was incredibly easy, quick, and everything seems to be in check.

If you're a person who is constantly on public WiFi, this is a very good product to protect your information. It can be used on up to five devices such as an iPad, iPod touch, Mac, and PC.

I like this software, and I have had no issues with it.  I sometimes use public WiFi when traveling so this software is very useful for me.
It includes a one-year protection."
"Do not buy.  I have used TurboTax for several years with no problem - until now.  Intuit  has ruined the program and it will not work.  You end up in a loop trying to update the forms and files - which the program will not do unless you call and give a code.  When you call you get an automated Robo voice which after several questions tells you to wait and then disconnects about a minute later.

TurboTax also seems much more intrusive than before.  It snoops all over your computer files for extra information that it does not need."
"Only a limited trial version is ""free"".  I bought the software for 1 year & started having problems with my computer right away.  Their customer service by phone was not satisfactory- they did not solve my problem or even try.  They do not back up their product with any guarantee.  DO NOT WASTE YOU TIME OR MONEY!!"
"A very large bundle of very excellent software for a very small price.  These are great productivity tools for High School and College students, and is more than enough for home use."
Cute and comfortable
"I was moments away from purchasing this at a retail store even though the only feature I really wanted was the ability to burn HD-format video onto a standard DVD (obviously with less time per disc due to the much smaller storage size). This was the number-one touted feature on the box (and on the Amazon website). I didn't have my reading glasses with me and almost missed the itty-bitty 2-point type down at the bottom that said that this feature was only available with a separate purchase of a special plug-in only available from Roxio. What the crud? This is SOFTWARE, not a mechanical device... if the software doesn't support the feature it advertises, then IT""S NOT A FEATURE... the plug-in is a separate software product and they should not be able to advertise it as part of the parent application! This is one of the most misleading cheats I've ever seen. At least on the web-site they don't hide it in 2-point type, you just have to follow the asterisks. If it's still worth it to you, and you don't mind rewarding deceptive marketing practices, the plug-in is available at the Roxio web site for twenty bucks extra. Let me know how it works, cuz' I ain't buying it."
"I'm not the biggest fan of security suites that try to nanny you whenever you open a browser, and in that regard, Trend hasn't really won me over. Like AVG and Norton, Trend splatters iconography all over the place to let you know what it thinks is safe, and what's not. Personally, I think it's a bit gimmicky.

Similarly, the ""tune up"" functionality seems like it serves more purpose making customers feel like they don't need to fall for those TV ads that make ridiculous promises. Taken in that light, it's a fine way to stop Grandma from wasting a bunch of money on making her computer 400% faster than when she bought it, or some such nonsense.

As for the underlying virus scanner... It's fast, accurate, and efficient. Where Norton wants to slowly rob your system of resources, and Kaspersky wants to spend as much time as tolerable launching its console, Trend seems to get everything right. I'm hesitant to call it the best AV solution out there, but it's definitely in the running."
"Good protection, occasionally appears to slows down browser"
"<Warning: You must be careful of [stealth marketing], and wrong reviews.>

Microsoft Office 2016 is inferior to Office 2010. Office 2016 has many malfunctions and inconveniences. So, you must not purchase [Microsoft Office 2016]. I report as a victim to you.

If you need a high-performance office software, you should purchase [Microsoft Office 2010] or less.
If you need a low-performance office software, you should use free software, like Libre Office, Google Drive, and so on.

<Detailed Explanations>
During operation of Office 2016, we must carry out forcible sign-in at Microsoft account certainly. As the proof, our [Microsoft licensing name] is displayed in the screen of upper right absolutely. It is useless information.

When we save a file, [Access to the Microsoft's storage in the Internet] is displayed preferentially, like OneDrive. Because, It is a source of revenue for Microsoft. But, it is very useless for users.

About 20 days after I started to use Office 2016, a following error was displayed.
----------------------------------------
The license of this application is not found. Restoration was failed. Microsoft Office will end.
[OK] [Help]
----------------------------------------

I searched about this error in the Internet, and I realized that many users is suffering from the same error. [The licensing data for Office 2016] is very fragile, despite very high licensing fee.

When we use Microsoft Outlook, A weather report is compulsorily displayed in the center of the upper part of the screen. This is an absolute deterioration. The very useless information is displayed in the most important place. It is too user-experience.

Many icons are made into monochrome. In Office 2010, users can distinguish many icons with their color. So, Office 2016 became very inconvenient. It is too user-experience.

Excel 2016 often displays an error [Operation was stopped] and it is forced to terminate.

<FAQ (Frequent Answers and Questions)>
Question: You recommend Office 2010, but the support term is shorter than later version.

Amswer: No problem. Any problem cannot be found, even if the support period passes. Because this is a typical sales promotion called [a support end fraud].

Microsoft always forces purchasing latest products for end of support period. However, how many injury occured? The answer is [zero]. You can confirm it with retrieving the information in the Internet. Informational underdogs are being deceived by the sales promotion. Even if you suffered from a victim, the amount of damage is much less than [the cost of the installation for the useless software].

Now, which is you, an informational winner, or an informational loser?"
"Pinnacle Studio 20 Plus is a good entry in the Pinnacle Studio 20 lineup, the other 2 being the standard or basic and an Ultimate version.  I will be testing and reviewing this on an Intel Core i7-4770, 16GB ram in Windows 10 64bit.  Additional hardware to note is gpu of Nvidia gtx970 and a 4k lcd monitor.  Files to be tested will be 1080p.

You'll enter your serial number, then choose a path for installation.  You'll be installing the main program, standard content, bonus content, and 20.0.1 service pack off the internet.  I normally install most of my programs to D, not the typical C, so here's hoping there won't be any issues with that.  Installation was wonky in a sense for me.  In the end, the main program installed itself to C, gave me an install choice in which I chose D but it installed Pinnacle MyDVD there...so who knows what it needs to install.  After installation, you'll be greeted with a registration page upon startup of the program.  After startup, make sure to set your preferences.

So I couldn't figure out how to add my own track and opted to use one included in the program.  I decided to export a 1080p video to 1080p with the altered audio track to see how it would turn out .  Surprisingly the file is smaller than the original and still seems to retain the quality with what I could only imagine is a lot more audio information.

Features I'll hopefully test out will be the live screen capture and later the stop motion animation.  I also want to test its 3d editing powers but don't have anything for that yet either.

For now I'll give it a 4 star rating.  Not the easiest or intuitive to use but hopefully with more learning and usage this will improve.  If and when it improves I will come back and bump up the review to a 5.  I'll be testing and using the software ongoing almost daily, at least once a week anyway given time constraints."
"Perfect, thank you!"
"I installed this on my Asus netbook, and my Android tablet running Froyo. Both less than 12 months old, and neither one used much on a regular basis.

The Netbook:  This software, during the installation process, tries to make you think it's found threats on your computer, when I know for a fact my netbook had nothing wrong with it.  It's a scare tactic to make you think you NEED McAfee (and no other brand) to make your PC-life better and stress-free.  I didn't care for this.  The installation was smooth and problem-free, but seemed to slow the Atom processor down just enough to be annoying.  I uninstalled it, and went back to Free AVAST. I also wish a CD would have been included but I can see where that would only be useful for PC's with a CD drive and that's not the market-share McAfee is seeking with this security suite.

The Tablet:  The one thing it did was cause my tablet to lock up. I didn't want to bother trying to figure out the cause so I restored the tablet back to the default. IMHO tablets don't need an anti-virus."

"I have had the free version of this on my computer for at least a couple of years. That one has saved me from several bad web sites and has been well worth installing it. I didn't really think that the full version would be that much different but it is. When having it running while doing a search, in the results it will tell the safe sites from the bad and catch about 90% or more of the bad ones. So if you do a lot of surfing and looking up stuff this will help guide you away from the bad sites that can damage your computer.
  Some of the other reviewers say that they cant see any use for it for advanced Internet users, but anybody can stumble into a bad site and not know it, even the pros. And although I don't like any of the other McAfee programs, (there antivirus program that was with my MSN DSL slowed my computer down to a crawl and missed a lot of stuff that some of the free antivirus programs like AVG picked up on) I do like this one and recommend it for all Internet users. For only $20 its a cheap safety net that works."
Intuit has again hit a home run with the 2015 edition of their tax program.  It is very easy to fill in your information because of the question format.  I've used Turbo Tax and loved it for many years now and every year it is better than the last.  I highly recommend Turbo Tax.
"I can't imagine living without TurboTax to deal with our abomination of a tax system.  I don't know if it's accurate or not and don't care.  In March, I fire it up, enter a bunch of garbage, and click File.  Done, gone, over with for another year."

"(...)""The New Yorker"" does set the standard. I can't agree with every idea, and not every standard they set is worth chasing. However, the sum of this magazine, helped founded by the great wit Dorothy Parker, is a solid thinking, literary, humorous magazine.

I fully recommend ""The New Yorker.""

"I always run hot and cold on these photo and video editing programs. Some programs offer too much flexibility (Photoshop), while others completely fall short (I'll let you fill that one in). Some provide too many additional add-on features, some provide none. With PD5 Ultra, Cyberlink has hit the sweet spot for me, as I am not a professional photographer, but want to be able to manage and edit my work.

Installation was easy and smooth on my WIndows 7 64-bit computer (yes, it's got native 64-bit support). Start-up is very quick, and the interface is excellent - a neutral grey that makes it easy to work with your photos. Importing is easy and relatively quick, letting you get to work almost right away.

There are five main sections: library, edit, slidewshow, print, and adjustment.

The Library section is great. It's basic, but really works nicely and smoothly, gathering all my photos into one easy-to-navigate and searchable place. It's often the libraries that I dislike the most in these programs, but I'm very happy with the one in PD 5.

Adjustment lets you tweak thinks like white balance, color, tone, tinge, etc - you'll be familiar with these as they're settings found in most cameras. Don't want to go manual? There are a huge number of presets available as well, for those that like to grab and go Instagram style, and they're all quite good. An excellent and well balanced set of tools overall.

Edit provides the full suite of tools one would expect; object removal, merge, frames, effects, etc. For the most part, the effects are excellent and varied. The extract tool works fairly well (using a lasso or smart-tool) and the ability to tweak the results is a welcome feature. Object removal works well too, though depending on the subject matter it can struggle from time to time.

Slideshow and print are simple and what you would expect: ways to build slideshows or set up printing.

Honestly, the program is too deep to list everything it can do in one place. Cyberlink provides a bunch of tutorials that are set up to help beginners and experts alike get the most from the program - and there's a lot to get.

It runs rock solid, looks great, has a suite of excellent tools and allows beginners to get going while more advanced users can dig deeper. A fantastic program, a great choice and now my go-to photo editing software."

"Amazon had the best price for Norton 360 for 365 days than the norton website. I paid almost $28. I received the cd for the product, too. The norton software on my computer was about to expire any day when I received my new norton  antivirus in the mail. I am a satisfied Amazon customer and norton user."
"I've been a Kaspersky Internet Security (KIS) user for several years and never had a problem.  The product worked, and a transition from my older Windows XP systems to 64-bit Windows 7 systems was largely seamless.

I typically shop for security software all year long - when I see a good deal, I buy it, knowing that at some point, my annual subscription will require (expensive) renewal.  So it was in June 2011 when I bought PURE on a 100% rebate special. It sat on my shelf for 5 months while my KIS-2011 subscription ran out, then I tried to install PURE, after doing a complete un-install of the expired KIS-2011 product.

While PURE installed OK, updated, ran scans, and appeared to provide firewall protection, it was incompatible with MS Outlook (Office 2010 - 64 bit version).  I could not start MS Outlook if PURE was running as Outlook would just hang indefinitely.  If I exited PURE, Outlook ran fine.  This problem is widely posted now on various forums, and it appears that Kaspersky still has not been able to fix it in the current version of PURE (I had build 152 after it completed all of the updates).

After hours of troubleshooting with Kaspersky techs, they recommended that I try KIS-2012, so I downloaded the Trial version, un-installed PURE, and installed KIS. It works perfectly - no issue with hanging my email client.

So unless you really need the additional features of PURE, I'd recommend staying away from it this year.  KIS-2012 has been updated, works fast, unobtrusively, and reliably.

It took me a couple weeks to work out an exchange for the non-usable PURE product, but Kaspersky made good on an exchange and I now have KIS-2012 going for the coming year.  Not a big deal for me as there is better Password manager and disc encryption software available, and I don't need remote management of security in my small business environment.

I gave it 3-stars because the rest of the product appeared to work as advertised -- I just could not use the Anti-Spam, nor could I run my email client at all when PURE was installed."
"Love this shampoo. I first bought it years ago from Sally's Beauty Supply. I have very coarse hair. It leaves it silky smooth and feels like I don't even need conditioner,  which is a first. I like that it doesn't contain phosphates, because that's not something I want to have to worry about. I'm definitely going to purchase this again. Great shampoo!"
"I've been using Quicken for a while and I think more people should use it for their budgeting needs and to track their spending.  I have all of our finances loaded into it and it lets me see where we can save and helps me plan for those big purchases or trips.

Quicken will help you get a handle on your finances in a time when that is more and more important."
"After ten years of using Turbo Tax, I will be taking my money to H&R. While there is nothing wrong with TT, it's actually a fine product, this is the second time in 3 years that the makers greed has overshadowed the usefulness of the software.
As a Quickbooks user, this ""over site"" by parent company Intuit, has also lead me to start looking for an alternative to QB as well."

"This is the fourth Pre de Provence soap I tried, I loved the others but this one dried my skin out. After using my skin felt tight and itchy and to calm it I had to use a total body lotion after the shower. This soap arrived in a clear plastic wrap with no labeling at all without an ingredient list. The scent to me is of citrus and I suspect the natural oils of the citrus fruits in the fragrance are what is oil-stripping my skin and leaving me with dried out skin. Ratings 2 stars = Don't Like It. I cannot comment on anything else about the ingredients since I have no ingredient list and there is not one on the product page either."
"Probably the most expensive of all - but also has the highest of ratings.

This is my second year using Kaspersky Internet Security (KIS) and I am more satisfied than last year.  This version seems to create fewer confusing situations and also appears to be stealth in operation.

I have to admit, however, there is a lot to this program that I know little about - but try and learn as I use it.

There wasn't a User Manual with the shipped product, but there is an easily downloadable version that you can obtain from Kaspersky.com.  I am one that would have prefered a hardcopy at installation - but loading and launching was a breeze!

From my past experiences with this product it can be difficult getting through to Kaspersky's Tech department if you require immediate help.  You may have to wait a few days for any acknowledgement.  But when received, it is usually very specific and to the point.  I have had a few opportunities to discuss a loading procedure with a live Tech and was very pleased with their level of competence and understanding of my situation."
"If Microsoft 8 works faster and better under the hood, great.  I am not opposed to the pretty tiles..  but they lead to apps that just don't cut it.  I have spent years finding and working with programs (mail client for example) that do what I want very well.  Great if they come up with a better mail client but they haven't... and it is unlikely that they will be better than the market (this was always Windows' strength..the market competes to come up with applications that work well).

The aggregation function of the people app is nice, but frankly, it just isn't as good as the facebook page itself so I am not going there. It is cool to see my photos aggregated, but the functionality isn't near as good as picasa.

so I have to wade through these tiles to get back to the programs I already know and use.  It seems like such a waste of time.  I am happy to try new things but they just seem to want to go to the top down approach of apple (with all their built in apple applications).  It works for apple because they have honed these programs over years and years.  Even at that, they aren't as good as marketplace produced applications.  Their benefit is that they are so tightly integrated with apple, they work well without glitches etc.. but still, they are only valuable because they have been honed.  I am not willing to wait 10 years as MS hones its mail app.  I'll use the one I have.  Or finally go to apple if this becomes too much of a hassle.

I tried windows 8 on my extra laptop.  If I avoid the apps and go right to my desktop, it is fine.. but annoying.  I will not upgrade my main desktop computer or my other laptops.

This is a fail.

"I've been using Office 2011 for Mac for a few years and it's been fine. I also use Office 2007 for Windows and both have been fine. Recently, I started using Office 2016 for Windows for work and wondered how the new Mac version looked. I have to tell you, all the professional reviews I read were very high on Office 2016 for Mac, but all the user reviews on Amazon and elsewhere painted a completely different picture. I went into my evaluation of Office Home and Business 2016 for Mac with huge reservations, but after about a week, I'm beginning to think that Microsoft may have resolved many of the issues that that existed at launch.

I'm using an old MacBook Air (mid 2012) with just 4GB of RAM and the Office installation did not suddenly bog my system down, nor have I had problems actually running Office. Every piece of the suite--Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook--runs smoothly on my Mac. And they look so much better than Office 2011. One bummer I didn't know about in advance was that Outlook 2016 for Mac only supports Exchange Server 2012 and above and my company hasn't yet upgraded to the newer Exchange server. I'm not sure why this limitation exists for the Mac, because the Windows version works fine with the older Exchange server.

I also want to mention that I researched the licensing and from what I've read, you can install this version more than once, but it can only be running on one computer at a time. If you happen to get a new computer or you reinstall the OS, you're allowed to install it again. The caveat is that you must uninstall it from everywhere else and you can only do this once every 90 days. Also keep in mind that this version does not allow you to install Office on your iPad or iPhone. Those licenses only come with a subscription to Office 365."
"Item arrived in a timely manner, securely packaged. I have used this product since 2006. Very user-friendly, easy to follow and complete forms. Data can be brought forward from the prior year. Very nifty features such as error checking and estimating your risk of an audit. E-filing is included."

"Let me start by saying I am no way a professional photographer, but this software makes me feel like one. I take a lot of photo's of my grandson, and let me tell you, this software makes them look professional. I could upload all the pictures, and file them, then drag out the ones that I was to edit, but it saves my original pictures AND the ones that I have edited. This software loaded on my computer with no problems. It hasn't frozen up my computer yet. Which is a problem I have had in the past with other photo editing software. I will stick to this for a while."

"I was a geek back in the days of DOS and PKZIP.  ZIP products are just something I need.  Back then, of course, we had no clouds for storage, only PCs and servers.

WinZip is worth the price of admission just for storing photos before uploading them to cloud storage.  That free space goes fast!  And you need a backup, not just on an external drive, but off site from your computer.

WinZip is easy to use, and I always have it on my computers."
Its a great product an gets better every year.
"I haven't really had a chance to make a document yet, but I have ordered a book, and I will be using it a lot.

There is a brush or a crayon, or a charcoal for every purpose. I have tested all kinds of combinations with colors, textures, brushes, etc.  They are AMAZING!

The tools are easy to use.  As a Photoshop user there was a learning curve, but then I found there were a lot of commonalities.

This program is made to work hand-in-hand with such programs as Photoshop.  Corel even says so on it's site.

Painter is quite powerful; yet, even though it is no substitute for Photoshop it is way less expensive.  Corel customer service is good too.

My only complaint is that it is prompting me for updates, and I keep installing, but it is definitely not as easy as Adobe.

I am so impressed by Painter and other Corel products that I am purchasing a Wacom tablet.  A small version of the latest model.

I know I made a great decision to purchase Painter 11."
"I have some windows 8 devices, but they occasionally annoy me because of all the lame defaults that are hard to change.  It's easier to repair Windows 7 to get away from the spurious default settings and attempts to do unwanted favors."
"My daughter is very interested in drawing and recently bought herself a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wacom-Bamboo-Spark/dp/B010PKT6C2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wacom Bamboo Spark</a>&nbsp;with some money she earned. She is not super computer savvy, but wants to turn her art into computer-type comics or maybe graphics for t-shirts. The Bamboo Spark helps her use her love for drawing by hand with a pen, into a computer image, but she needed a program to help refine and color her drawings.

We have Adobe Photoshop student edition, but it is really suited more for photos. She can use it and enjoys it, but she doesn't really like it for drawings. She thought this would be a nice tool that would work for both photos and drawings. She loves it so far!

It is definitely powerful. There are so many features that we just are learning. I was almost embarrassed to try to write a review because so many of them are written by people who are skilled with these programs and zoom through all the features right out of the box. But then I figured that there must be other people like us who are beginners and looking to learn...everyone had to be a beginner once, right!? ha ha

We like that there is a tour right away to help you get started. There are also a bunch of videos available to help you with what you want to do. I know when she first started with the Photoshop, and wanted to so something like a gradient, the internet was a huge help to walk you through step by step, and then you felt more comfortable with improving on that if you wanted. I know this program isn't as popular as Adobe, so there might not be as many instructional pages around, but we chose Corel anyway. I have always found Corel items just to be more simple and intuitive. I am a huge fan of WordPerfect and update that all the time. I always get complements on my documents and people always want to know how I did something...and I tell them you gotta ditch that crappy MS word! ha ha!

I really like that we can just use this without a lot of training or experience and without subscription. It isn't cheap upfront, but it is a powerful program. You can get cheaper or free stuff, but it just doesn't have the tools needed to really be creative. This is a wonderful introduction to a higher level."
Great content - we grew up reading this magazine and it endures
"Discounted Panda Express? Yes please! Bought this on a lightning deal, so it was a few bucks off."
It's okay. Works fine. Ribbon bent.
It is good in that it will transfer prior years as well as download financial info.
"If youve used MS Streets & Trips in the past then you know this version is not their best effort.

My biggest complaint is the automatic routing. MSST will point you in the general direction but I seem to have to do more refining of the route in this version than I did the last. Otherwise, it will guide you the long way around a more simple & shorter route. The ability to choose driving styles or roads has been limited in this version. Im not sure why!?

Im a nationwide truck driver & I use MSST mainly to plan a trip & check the miles before I leave. And even though I purchased a small ultraportable 12"" laptop for the road, its still difficult to use the GPS function as there isn't room for the laptop for safe visibility. And, its just not a very good GPS product. Its semi adequate.

For GPS, I use a Garmin Nuvi 350 & its great. Its far more expensive than the MSST but its far more useful.

MSST is a good product for the money if you get it on sale. Much better than yahoo maps or the other freebies. Just don't expect to much..."
"Really nice package of programs, works very well, and quite easy to learn how to use it. I had to contact customer service with installation help, and they responded reasonably fast. There was a hardcover book with feature descriptions included.
It is very versatile, you can do so much with the suite, from professional applications to kid's projects to making study materials for the classroom to web site creation and so much more."
"I honestly have to say that when it does come down to computer software, Microsoft has been the leader at getting the programs out to the public, and has taken a very strong stance at delivering the best for all your PC needs. But while Microsoft has been so dominant with those needs, Apple has been one of those companies that has delivered with external devices brilliantly, especially with the Ipod and Itunes assertively. But for word processing, it has been your choice of one or the other. But there are also those whom are just not really thrilled about getting into a subscription service for MS Office 365. They may have just one computer, and only one for those needs. Well, this would be a good buy for those with only 1 Mac computer for those simple needs. Microsoft Office 2016 for 1 Mac computer, works just as strongly as the Office 2016 for the Windows computers, and you do have all the simple features including Word, Excel & many of all your office software needs. It runs very smoothly, and doesn't have a lot of flaws when installed. It works very nicely with updating all your old files from Word and some from other word processing suites like Corel, and converts them so well. It really stands up well for the money, and runs very smoothly on the Mac computers. I sincerely recommend this suite for your Mac computer. While Microsoft has been so geared on Windows, they have some really good pieces for the Apple brothers.

"I have reviewed a number of products over the years for virus protection and general security. My major concerns tend to be in order: does it work (is it actually catching anything?), system resource usage (when active and in background), memory footprint (how much of my system memory does it use) - both of the last bear directly on the impact on other program performance - and lastly ease of customization.

On all counts this product has been a success in my opinion, it has reported numerous cookie and Trojans discovered over the past 6 months (highlighting risky websites before I traveled to them). It does tend to be a little more resource intensive while scanning than some other products I have used (both during active and background scans), noticeably slowing down other software. The memory footprint is small and certainly competitive with the best products I have used in the past. Customization of scan schedules, and trusted sites/senders is fairly easy, and certainly competitive.

Kapersky and Viper were past favorites for their small footprint, low impact of system performance and ease of use. I have panned McAfee and Norton for their piggish use of system resources and difficulty in customization. My overall feel for this product is that while it may not be what I would consider a best buy (mostly due to system slow down while scanning even in background mode), it is much closer to my preferred products than those I do not like and can comfortably recommend it. P-)"
It's a gift card. Not much else to say :-)
"Firstly, let me start by saying that I am a complete newbie to PaperPort; this is the first time I have tired the program.  As such, I initially found myself overwhelmed by the sheer amount of things I could do with my documents, be they existing and newly created/scanned. However, after spending some time with the tutorials, I started to get the hang of things.

Here is my experience with Paperport 12:

WHAT IT IS:
Paperport is ""document management software.""  It's not just scanning, or  OCR, or PDF software; it's everything you thought you could do with your documents and photos, and then some.  The program is aimed towards users with knowledge of scanning and editing, and for the most part, assumes you already have basic understanding/familiarity with this.

WHAT IT DOES:
* Scans Documents
* Views and Edits PDF Files
* Edits and Enhances Images
* Organizes Files
* Assembles Documents
* Searches for Items
* Add Notes
* Handles Forms

OBSERVATIONS:
* I installed Paperport 12 on my Windows 7 Pro (64-bit) computer, and it runs perfectly.

* There is a downloadable scanner database that works with Paperport, and you may or may not need to troubleshoot your scanner to get it to work.  My scanner is an Epson V300, and I was able to get this to work from within Paperport after downloading the database and running the troubleshooter.

* You can scan your documents, page by page, and add them to ""stacks"" of pages, which then can be turned into a searchable PDF file.  You can also stack existing documents and turn those into PDF files for sharing.  Paperport comes with a full PDF editor, which allows you to add photos, forms, etc to your PDF documents.

* Paperport uses ""OmniPage"" as the OCR engine.  However, to use OCR, you first have to make a searchable PDF.  I was unable to get this feature to work with my test page.  Back to the tutorials!

* The program uses a ""ribbon"" style toolbar (as seen in Microsoft Office) so if you are not familiar with the ribbon toolbar, (like me!) then you might be a bit lost at first.

CONCLUSION:
If you've used previous versions of Paperport (or something similar) in the past, then you will probably have no trouble navigating the mountain of menus on the ribbon toolbar.  I know that as a beginner, I have only scratched the surface of what Paperport can do, but so far I like what I see.  I look forward to taming the clutter . . . after spending more time with the tutorials.  Because Paperport 12 is not beginner friendly, but has such great potential if you take the time to learn it, I am rating this product 4 out of 5 stars."
"Delicious, inspiring, magical ideas.  I enjoy reading this magazine from cover to cover as soon as it arrives.  I dogear the recipes I want to revisit and then end up making many of them once the rest of the family has gotten their hands on it and the requests start pouring in.  Fun ideas.  Healthy ingredients.  Loved the bookmarks provided.  Photos are so cheerful.  Articles are great at introducing new foods, ideas and cooking methods.  A magazine I look forward to finding in the mailbox. (We do not have cable (an experiment) so I do not get to see these recipes when they are featured on the Food Network so this makes up for it!)"
This was a gift.
"Pros:
* Upgrading from Pro X6 on my Windows 7 machine went smoothly
* A boatload of special effects/transitions
* Allows easy manipulation of audio/video separately or in tandem
* Renders video very quickly (my videos average 15 min. apiece and will render within a few minutes if they aren't heavy of the audio and extras--of course, this would vary based on the type of video you're producing along with your hardware set up)

Neutral:
* Doesn't include a user manual--documentation must be downloaded from the Corel website (and it's highly recommended to do so and read it because...learning curve)

Cons:
* Learning curve -- I went through this with X6 Pro, but this upgrade moved a few things around and added a few features which sent me back to VideoStudion bootcamp, so it's wise to plan accordingly
* Ultra-strict licensing -- this isn't new, but still worth mentioning: If privacy is a major concern, you'll want to read and re-read the license agreement because there's a note in there about collecting potentially personally identifiable information, plus, you may only install this software on a single machine and should you wish to reinstall it on another machine, you'd need to contact Corel for permission.

Overall, this was a great upgrade from the previous version of VideoStudio with added useful features an the simplification of a few others."
The best way to gift :) just make sure to check the balance prior to giving it as mistakes can be made with card balances. Otherwise great idea for my friends as I purchased a few of them for birthdays nothing like the gift of coffee and teas from a good company.
"This program is an absolute blast to use!  Think of creating your own Wallace and Gromit style movies.  Of course, it is tedious, and time consuming (you'll be amazed at how short your film ends up being after quite a bit of work), but it can be fun as well.  The software is really easy to use, and it helps you along.  For example, you can overlay the previous frame on your current one to make sure you didn't move the LEGOs (or whatever your subject is) too far at one time.  The final product is surprisingly professional.

The only thing you need to be aware of is that this doesn't work with just any camera.  You need certain camcorders or DSLR cameras (listed in the product description) or you can simply use the computer's web cam.  Of course, that means two major drawbacks.  First, your built in webcam probably doesn't offer you very many options in aiming the camera.  Second, most built in webcams are very low resolution.  So while you can shoot HD video with this, you can't with your built in webcam.  The end result is slick, but too low resolution for most needs.

In the end, this is five star software if you have the right camera, but four star software if you don't."
"I'll update the review after a while of using it. For now, it seems to work fine. The installation went without problem (I uninstalled all of my previous security software first). It works as described so far, but as everyone knows, you really can't be sure how well a security program is working until you've used it for aa while and it's been tested by real attacks.

So, so far so good. It stays in the background and seems no different, basically, from the Norton that I usually use."
"The Rosetta Stone (RS) learning interface is well designed and very clean. It is the most user friendly language learning program I've experienced.  What's more, the user interface applies to all of their language modules so learners of multiple RS language modules will be comfortable and at home with the ""dynamic immersion"" approach.

At best, the RS Mandarin will train you to be conversational in Mandarin. It will not allow you to recognize and write Chinese characters easily- that is an entirely different discipline better served by other instructional approaches. It is possible to speak and not be able to read the characters at this stage.

Mandarin is hard language to speak for most westerners. The 4 primary pronunciation tones (see Wiki's Pinyin article for an excellent overview) sound subtle to western tongues and are very hard to pronounce for the typical English speaker. This is because the way the mouth (lips, tongue, breathing) moves in pronouncing Mandarin is completely different to speaking English. My wife, an American from the South who speaks English with a somewhat relaxed and dragged out accent, has incredible difficulty in discerning the tonal differences, let alone pronouncing them accurately. Discerning and learning these tonal differences is crucial to successful conversational Mandarin. If you remember the 70's-80's Kung-Fu movies, they sometimes have a Westerner as a sparring combatant and they will sometimes speak some Mandarin in between the flying punches. To the Mandarin speaker, it always sounds really funny because they have typically messed up the tonal inflections. For example, ""ma"" can mean mother, horse, to scold, to wipe, a question, measles, etc., when used with the correct tone and context. So, to avoid speaking ""Kung-Fu Mandarin"" (comical and embarrassing in a business meeting, but at least it gets them smiling), it is essential to listen to the Mandarin speakers on the RS software very very carefully and practice repeatedly. That said, the speakers on the RS software have clear excellent accents but the microphone pronunciation feedback tool is not tight enough and will tolerate tonal mis-pronunciations.

If you are learning Mandarin alone, it would be very helpful to still seek a native Mandarin speaker. It helps to observe the mouth when pronouncing the words (I wish RS would have avi's of the speaker's mouth up close as a pronouncing aid). It also helps to be corrected immediately to avoid entrenching bad habits. And if you are finding an instructor, get an educated person that speaks with a proper accent. You want the Beijing news reader quality. China is a large country and speakers from different parts of China have very different accents. For example, speakers from HK or Canton will often speak (if they even can!) Mandarin that is heavily tinged with a Cantonese accent.  No point learning that. Should you be discouraged? No!!! If you are in China or get Chinese cable programs, you will notice some westerners on the language and outreach programs. Folks, these guys speak a brand of Mandarin with such accuracy and poise that would put most native speakers to shame!"
"As a longtime user of Photoshop, I recommend that these high-end features are not for everybody, and I have been searching over the past few years for a good alternative for the beginning or lite user, who just needs a basic photo editing tool for red-eye removal, the addition of some basic but cool effects, and file management.

Core PaintShop Photo Express looked like it might be that tool, so I was excited when I was given the opportunity to try it out. Let me start with what I like:

1. Good integration with online services. It is very easy to go from PaintShop to post the photos on photo sharing sites or to even get them printed. However, this is not a feature unique to PaintShop and even some free programs (Picasa) do it almost as well.
2. Media organizer: For people like my grandparents who for some reason have a very difficult time organizing files and folders within Windows, I do think that the Media Organizer could be helpful. It is not quite as powerful as Adobe Bridge, but is very user friendly. Power users will be annoyed at its lack of features.
3. Simple edits: To do basic edits, Corel is very simple. Cropping, red eye removal, and pre-made enhancements are easy to add.

HOWEVER,
as one reviewer has already commented, the fact that it overwrites original files is extremely dangerous, especially for the entry-level user at which this app is targeted. Yes it's cool to change the colors, crop, and add effects to photos. But these need to be saved as separate files so that the original untouched photo is still available. As far as I can tell, this isn't even an option. People like my grandparents won't even know what they're doing until they've changed all the pictures they've taken while playing around.

Also, all of the features that I like in Corel (see above) are done better in both Adobe Elements. As I said, the features of free programs like Google's Picasa really aren't that far off from what this app can do. So I do not recommend it.
Rather, for the entry level person, I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Photoshop-Elements-8/dp/B002ID8R3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Photoshop Elements 8</a>&nbsp;or Picasa, which is free.
For the advanced user (or one who wants to be) I'd recommend you get&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Photoshop-CS4/dp/B001EUBSL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Photoshop CS4</a>."
"The product requires activation, which includes sending machine identification information to Microsoft.

The good news is that the Office Standard license allows installation on both a desktop system AND a laptop.  It also allows you to transfer the license to new systems, over time.

From the license: ""Before you use the software under a license, you must assign that license to one device. ... You may install another copy on a portable device for use by the single primary user of the licensed device. ... You may reassign the license to a different device any number of times, but not more than one time every 90 days"""
"We are now in the second month of the third year of using Kaspersky to protect three computers on a home network.  This is the first year of ""cloud protection"", which I confess I still do not completely understand conceptually, but I have noticed that I get more warnings in the lower right-hand corner that potential threats have been stopped.  Kaspersky is definitely the most user friendly virus program that I have ever used, and I have used several:  McAfee, Trend Micro, Windows One Care, among others.  It loads smoothly initially, and for yearly updates, the process is even quicker. We run Kaspersky on computers with Windows 7 Home Premium and Internet Explorer 9.

The main menu has a summary page that summarizes your status on various aspects such as threats, protection, updates, license and recommendations.  From there you can focus on choosing several types of scans, updates, parental controls or tools, including creating a rescue disk, troubleshooting (which I have never had to do), privacy cleaner and browser configuration.  I particularly like that I can set everything once to run automatically every time I have the computer on and be done with it.  The other thing about most virus programs that is bothersome to me is that you usually have to disable them in order to install just about any other program.  Kaspersky is very forgiving in this respect as opposed to McAfee, which usually will not let you install anything without a big hassle.  When in scan mode, I have not noticed too much of a slowdown on my computer, although typically I run full scans when I am off the computer; these usually take about two hours to complete.  Overall, I am very satisfied with Kaspersky."
"As a former designer with over 10,000 hours of CADAM experience, I was interested to learn whether Corel's CAD program would be a good substitute for AutoCAD. While I no longer draft and design for a living, I have an occasional use for rendering drawings, both mechanical and architectural, and CorelCAD is considerably less expensive than AutoCAD. Plus, I have the experience with years of use of other Corel Suite programs.

I found installation of CorelCAD to be somewhat problematic since there's no guidelines other than the installation disk. It took several minutes for Virtual Studio 2.0 to install on my XP SP3 machine (3.3Ghz processor, 3.24GB RAM). At the point of registration I got an error message, however, following the guidelines listed by another reviewer, I was able to reboot and find the program functional.

Working with CorelCAD is quite different than CADAM where a stylus is used, however, both the cursor and typed commands replace the stylus, and after a short time and watching a couple of CorelCAD tutorials, I was able to begin a simple drawing.

I like being able to open, work with and save files in the DWG format, and I appreciate the customizable 2D and 3D design tools offered. Smart Editing lets me re-size, reposition, align and copy entities in seconds.  The Properties Palette allows me to layer, color and even copy properties from other entities. I have yet to try intersecting solid entities or use any of the more complex 3D operations, however, as I progress I will report of my findings. I am working with a Windows platform and prefer the DWG format though it also supports DXF and DWF formats.

One negative is that it takes an inordinately (well, maybe only seconds, but it seems too long) long time for the CorelCAD screen to appear after clicking on the icon, also the My Drawings folder that is created in the My Documents directory is a bit tedious to make changes to. It could be my older Dell computer that's the problem, but time will tell.

I have never used AutoCAD, but my experience with CADAM is only moderately helpful in operating and understanding CorelCAD. Thank goodness for the tutorials! I expect to move from novice to adequate user in a short time. More documentation seems to be on the way; it has ever been thus for Corel's other programs.

Note: check your software. There's a 2012 upgrade you can install. Here's the info from their website. ""If your version is anything lower than 12.4.056 you should download and install the revised update to benefit from an update notification within CorelCAD when the next update will be released in the future.
There is no need to uninstall the previous version of the software - the revision will update/ replace any previous version of CorelCAD.""

All in all, this is a fairly robust program that should serve the designer well at a fraction of the cost for AutoCAD."
"Cyberlink PowerDirector Ultimate Suite v11 uses a great video editor (see my review for Cyberlink PowerDirector Ultra v11) and adds two new applications called ColorDirector and AudioDirector plus additional bonus extras.

ColorDirector refines your clips with many options. Changes that you can make include tone, white balance, brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, clarity, exposure ect... Presets are available as well as the ability to link to key frames. You can define selected areas to change the color within or outside the selected boundary then users can apply a motion or gradient mask.

AudioDirector improves on the wave editor. Process and change your audio using multiple layers. Volume and audio effects can be linked to key frames. Use audio tools - noise reduction to remove background noise. Spectral view to visually see and remove defects.

As I said in my other Cyberlink review steps have been taken to make this a faster program including Cyberlink's Smart Video Render Technology (SVRT) which only renders clips that require it and leaves the rest.

System requirements:
This powerful software needs powerful computer hardware.
CPU - fast and powerful
RAM - 6 GB
HD space - 100 GB recommended
Graphics card - 1 GB or higher VRAM and openCL capable recommended

Bonus effects and design packs create extra value.
Includes:
10 motion effects
12 paint effects
Travel pack 2, Holiday MagicStyle pack and Romance Pack v3 design packs.

Excellent product for making ""professional"" home movies."
There very nice
"Very happy with Amazon Music.

Easy to download and upload music.  Easy to manage music.  Functionality is better than iTunes.

My favorite feature is having the lyrics."
"I just purchased this a couple of weeks ago and have been using it at least 4 times a week.  Love the voice recorder that lets you see how well your spanish is.

Some of the audio is too fast, but overall this is a great program for the cost!"
"I upgraded (from 2012) in order to have mobile access to the data.  And that is a useful & long-desired improvement.

Unfortunately, Intuit did its usual half-hearted, half-designed job with this feature, and it's quite disappointing:
1.  You can't sync investment accounts.  The old investing.quicken.com site is very limited, not worth using.  (For example, you can't see simple consolidated views of your investments, can't run basic reports. etc.)
2.  The sync from the desktop isn't automatic, and takes a long time.  If you're used to other online products that sync to the desktop (think Dropbox & Google Drive as two very popular examples, there are many others), you will find this clunky & old-tech.  Everytime you open Quicken, it will tell you you made changes, whether you did or not, and suggest that you sync.  This should be an automated, behind the scenes process, it's not hard.
3.  The alerts are rather dumb, and they're essentially hard-coded.  You can't create your own rules, and you can't even do a lot with the built-in rules (you can just pick some parameters from a limited list).  You can't delete them all either, if you consider them dumb and pointless.  Again, not hard to do a lot better.

There are no significant improvements in reporting, or in investment analysis.  If you look at the ""What's new in 2013"" page, you see mobile, alerts, and ""more flexible budgeting"", whatever that means.

There is a tweak to how accounts show up in the nav bar, where you can put some accounts in the ""Separate"" list, which means ""show but don't include with main set of accounts"".  This is mildly useful.  There's also a feature to mark an account ""closed"", also slightly useful -- in theory.  These account still show up in the list of accounts when you're doing a transfer between investment accounts!  Clearly someone forgot what the word ""closed"" might mean.

So all in all, same old Intuit, same old Quicken.  Buy it if the mobile feature is useful to you.  (BTW, I tried Mint as an alternative, and I couldn't stand the heavy-duty selling on every darned screen.  Maybe some people can tune this stuff out, I couldn't.)"
Nothing to it.  Just an advertisement.  Little article content.
"First and foremost this DOES NOT allow a upgrade from Windows 7.  It does allow you to keep all your data but does wipe out your applications so if there is a program you can't live without and can't find the original disks you have a BIG decision to make.  I would suggest you put all self generated files, e.g., documents on an external drive and then disconnect the drive just in case.

Shortly after the installation the OS did a critical update so when I came back to my computer it was done.  Note:  I did an 8.0 to  8.1 upgrade on my Surface pro the day before as a downloaded upgrade.  The results were not stellar to say the least.  On the tablet I had to remove the update because it wiped out the wifi connection and I tried everything I knew to restore it.  Once I backed off the update it worked just fine.  On the desktop (New Dell that came native with 8 on it) I began getting error messages saying that my IE browser was an old version of Netscape and it was incompatible.  The solution I found was to install the newest version of Fire Fox which seems to fixed the problem.  It appears that some vendors are not as compatible as they thought they were and MS has some work to do.

So In my estimation 8.1:
1.  Has some bugs that need to be addressed
2.  Is faster than 7 was
3.  Has a smaller learning curve
4.  Has some compatibility issues
5.  Needs to allow drive indexing for external drives to speed up the seek time
5. Needs MS attention to fix the glitches pronto if they want to gain in their market share."
"The shoes fit perfectly and came within the time frame i was given.  Very comfortable, which is needed since my job requires a lot if standing abd walking throughout the day."
"Love the product, except for the fact that TWO bottles have now broken after being dropped in the shower. The tops needs to be screwed off which I would change to a more friendly flip top which would not require three hands. The product is too expensive to  be wasted down the drain or watered down because the top keeps getting broken off (two different bottles)."
"I was a windows user most my life. I faithfully owned every version of Money Microsoft produced and then they did an end of life on there software so I switched to Quicken. Well then I got a mac and went to quicken for mac and it was nice. I used Quicken 2007 for mac for several years and finally Quicken came out with what they called ""Quicken Essentials"" which was just a useless program. They stripped out most the useful features, etc. So I downgraded back to Quicken 2007 as my primary finance tool and in parallel started playing with iBank. iBank is NOT as ""pretty"" as Quicken 2007 was which is sort of sad to say. But the software does everything I need it to do. Then when Apple announced OSX Lion and Quicken announced Quicken 2007 would not work well that just sealed the deal. I left quicken 2007 and have been using iBank 4. I've used iBank for probably 3 months now off and on and the last 2 weeks daily as my primary tool. It was a slow transition  as I wanted to get used to it slowly before I upgraded to Lion.

What I like is it works. It's simple and the web connect download of transactions is super fast. Quicken used to take a long time to download my transactions, iBank is a meere matter of seconds.

iBank also has the one feature most other software is missing, the cash flow forecast. A vital tool with how I do my budgets.

iBank is NOT the most polished piece of software I've ever used. But given the limited finance software on the mac it really is the best. Plus if you use the add-on iphone app and sync your data to it, you have one more way to keep track of your money. The app is a few bucks in the app store but it is worth it.

I'm happy with this, I wish they would fix some graphic issues, make the forecast chart look better, but that's really the only complaint I have and that's minor.

If you need finance software I recommend you download a trial version of this software from the developers website at iggsoftware and then if you like it enough to buy it, get it here on amazon as it is cheaper then buying it straight from the developer or the apple app store."
Cleansing properties are above any praise! Suprised by how good an all-organic product can be. Hair feel amazing after use.
"I can't honestly say if this thing is protecting me from viruses - but I can say that after a week of use we began the wrestling to remove it from the computer.  The number of popup warnings and ""update me again"" and ""pay for more protection"" things was driving me insane.  Every time the little box wanted to pop up in the lower right hand corner, whatever I was doing or typing would freeze up, Then the stupid box would pop up, and there was never an option to just make it go away for good.  Now I'm sure I could wrestle with the settings but really - I can get AVG for free and not have to fight with something that wants to update itself in the middle of my typing a proposal."
"I've been using PaintShopPro since version seven. I'm upgrading to X6 from X5&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PaintShop-Pro-X5-Ultimate/dp/B008MR2GKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PaintShop Pro X5  Ultimate</a>&nbsp;which I gave a very favorable review.

The biggest reason to upgrade to this new version, X6, is the 64-bit performance. It may, actually, be the only reason to upgrade now if you have X5 or X4 unless one of the added points of functionality is critical to use (some added RAW processing, mainly). I wanted the 64-bit because I do very large files and will have a dozen open at one time. X6 will speed this up for me, and keep more stability.

At this point, there are really only a couple things I go to Photoshop for anymore, versus PaintShopPro. One is right justified text - Photoshop does, PaintShopPro does not. There's a few image filters, too, which I like on Photoshop. Other than that... if you're looking for does-almost-it-all image processing, now with 64-bit performance, I recommend PaintShopPro X6."
Purchased for my daughter for gym class.  She loves them.  Very cute and very comfortable.
what's not to love
"""Message in a Haunted Mansion"" was my second Nancy Drew game (my first was ""The Final Scene."") The graphics are beautiful, with numerous little details that really made the Victorian mansion come alive. Nancy is staying with a friend and helping her fix up a Victorian mansion that she is going to turn into a B&B, except strange accidents keep happening that delay the grand opening. Is the house really haunted?
The only problem I encountered was that I must have played out of order, because I kept finding clues and I had no idea what they were related to. The story seemed disjointed and not as in-depth as with ""Treasure in the Royal Tower."" But I really enjoyed the bandit/Chinese subplot, the sance, and the many puzzles. The sound effects were genuinely creepy: one minute you will be walking down the hallway and the sound of a woman crying comes from nowhere. Or you're walking up a deserted staircase and you hear ghostly whispers.
There are two levels, junior and senior detective. The puzzles are slightly harder for senior detectives, but the plot is the same. If you get stuck you can call your friends Bess and George for hints. I needed to look online for hints quite a bit since, as I said earlier, I must have missed clues since large parts of the story were missing for me.
One of the things that bugged me was the fact that there really weren't many places to explore. You can't leave the house, and you only have access to your room and one other room, the attic, the dining room, parlor, and basement. I was hoping for more rooms/secret passageways to explore. Not having more locations really cut down on the game's length/replayability.
Overall, ""Message in a Haunted Mansion"" is a fun outing for detectives: a chance to explore a spooky haunted house, gather clues, learn about Chinese art and writing, and dig up clues about a timeless love story and hidden treasure."
"I was using Windows 98SE and overall was happy with it.  While I experienced some lockups and freezing, it didn't happen that often.  What prompted me to switch to XP was a desire for better memory management (Windows 98 doesn't do a very good job), more stability even though Win98 wasn't bad for me, and an overall change of scenery.  So finally I made the plunge, doing a clean install instead of trying to upgrade over 98.
The Upgrade Advisor that you can download from Microsoft.com was very useful.  Luckily everything except my NEC printer was compatible with XP.  Next, the Transfer Settings and Files Wizard that comes on the XP disk also came in handy.  It gathers all your settings and/or files from the ""old computer,"" saves them in a file (or transfers them directly - you have various options) which you can then put on the new computer.  I wound up transferring only settings using the wizard.  Originally I told it to transfer files too, but it copied too many things that were unnecessary and the result was way too big to fit on a cd.  I would advise copying your documents and other important files manually but letting XP transfer your settings.  That way you can be more selective about what gets transferred (assuming you are doing a clean install).
Installation of XP went very smoothly.  It identified all my hardware, and I was able to reinstall my software with no problems.  Using the Transfer Wizard to move the settings to the new installation worked fine and was a real time saver - it moved all of my internet and e-mail settings and messages over with ease.  All user input was very clearly explained and the process overall was quite simple.
Using XP: There's a lot I still have to learn, but so far the system has been stable and I notice memory is managed much better than under 98.  It loads faster and while the much more colorful layout took some getting used to, now it seems like 98 is in black and white by comparison.  I also use the ""clear type"" option for fonts and find that they are easier to read than under a ""normal"" display (it seems to me that the main difference is that clear type makes it darker and bolder).
I'm glad I made the switch.  I've read some complaints about installation experiences and also the strict registration requirements but my experience so far has been all positive (knock on wood, of course!).  It seems like the Microsoft engineers really gave this a lot of thought and put it into action."
"I have used Turbotax Deluxe for years. This year I cannot update seven files to get rid of the ""Do Not File"" note at the top of the forms. In fact I cannot file until these files are updated. I spend an hour on the phone with tech support. They finally gave me a new download. I installed it and have the same problem. It doesn't work well with El Capitan operating system. I hate to go to H&R Block but I am totally frustrated."
"I have been a user of Lightroom for several years.  I've dutifully upgraded from Lightroom 3 up to the current 5.1 as successive versions were released.  When I was offered the chance to review Cyberlink PhotoDirector 5 Ultra, it seemed like a natural fit...

To make a long story short, CPD5U is a solid competitor to Lightroom.  If you're a current Lightroom user, moving to CPD5U is a no brainer...the user interface is very similar and the workflow is the same.  It was able to import photos from my new Sony NEX-5T in both RAW and JPEG format.  Lightroom (at least my version) couldn't understand the RAW file.

So far, everything that I've tried to do in Lightroom can be duplicated in CPD5U.  Exposures, white balance, hue and saturation can be easily corrected; facial blemishes and red eye removed; pictures can be cropped and queued for printing.  Editing is non-destructive, which is critical if you need to back up and start over.

For roughly half the price of Lightroom, I don't see any reason that you shouldn't purchase this instead.  Unless there's a really good reason to continue upgrading LR - some feature that I absolutely need - I'm going to stop paying for new versions and switch to this instead.

Highly Recommended"
"...then you will love Vogue! Vogue is THE fashion magazine -- the competition pales in comparison. This gem does not only supply beauty and fashion advice, it breathes it. I love the articles on the latest fashions, love the profiles on the latest designers and I absolutely love the layouts taken from runway shows in London, Paris, Milan, New York, etc. I shall continue to renew my subscription as long as Vogue continues to maintain my healthy diet of Valentino and Prada."
Makes my hair shine better than anything else I've tried!
Not a lot of arch support but really lightweight.
I have used Quicken for years and usually up grade when new versions are available. It makes it easy to balance your bank statement every  month and track your savings.
"A good place for friends, and family. Adore the steak fries!"
"Corel products are really hit or miss for me. It seems like one month they're releasing software that I absolutely love and which functions beautifully, and the next they're putting out software which seems rushed and untested, or in some cases even worse than previous versions of the same product.
Corel VideoStudio Pro X3 is somewhere in the middle. I was really excited with it at first, as I run a blog and frequently create and edit videos for uploading to youtube. After really getting into it, however, the bugs and crashes started rearing their ugly head. I have been using it for a few months now, and thankfully I haven't completely lost any project I've been working on, but it's been a headache working through the problems. Corel support, while usually very helpful in my experiences with them, in this case didn't have much to say. Because of those issues, I cannot give this product a full recommendation.
It's still better than simplistic, problem-filled programs such as Roxio Creator, but I would recommend something like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sony-Vegas-Movie-Studio-HD-Platinum-10/dp/B003L4ZQKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sony Vegas Movie Studio HD Platinum 10</a>, which in my experience with it is less buggy and more to-the-point than VideoStudio Pro X3."
Great program much better than file explorer
Logan's is my favorite restaurant for steak.  Always cooked to perfection.
Great and easy
"Product is excellent. Priced fairly and arrived less than three days after purchase. Worked very well considering that it was different from the hardrive adapter that originally accompanied the unit. Overall, great deal! Highly recommend."
"I've been using the WillMaker Plus product for years. The 2012 edition is more of the same. Starting with a couple of editions back, they removed the trust maker from the product, which is a big shame.  You receive access to Nolo's online living trust website with this product, but a couple of weeks ago I received an e-mail saying that access was coming to an end for owners of this edition, and continued use would require payment.  As a long-time loyal user of Nolo products (and I have tons of their books, most of them bought out of pocket), I'm disappointed they have not reversed this poor decision to remove trust documents from WallMaker Plus."
"I bought this for one reason and one reason only: the hope that iMovie had been fixed from the 2008 version to be more like the 2006 version. Didn't happen. iMovie is now worse than ever. Editing audio files is probably the most frustrating thing I've tried in a while. The interface is not designed well, and I found myself looking for features that used to be there (fade out video effect in conjunction with audio fade out) thinking they've got got to be there somewhere, and then finding out that they simply don't exist.

IMPORTANT: If you install iMovie 09, it will make your existing install of iMovie HD UNUSABLE. You CANNOT keep your old installation of iMovie 06HD when you install iMovie 09! This is amazingly frustrating, especially sine iMovie 09 will not open iMovie 06 video files!

I honestly think they don't want to make iMovie 09 work the way it should to force people to buy the much more expensive Final Cut, even if you don't need all of the features of a full video editing software. Working with HD video in iMovie is a joke; it lags, stutters, and crashes for no apparent reason.

iPhoto is fine, but the new features are not that impressive. The face recognition would be awesome if it worked well, but it doesn't. It wanted to group my grandmother and my sister together (I guess there is a little family resemblance there). The GPS feature is awesome if you have a GPS enabled camera, but if you have a camera that nice you're probably using a proffesional image editing software. Eventually (next 2-3 years) as consumer cameras start to have built in GPS, this feature will be valuable, so I guess you could say iPhoto is ahead of its time.

Garage Band works like it should, but there aren't any improvements that make it worth upgrading. The much flaunted lessons must be bought and downloaded, they don't come with the software. It is useful certainly, but I just don't see anything that makes me believe upgrading is worth it.

Frankly, this is just another ho-hum release. You don't need to upgrade unless you just have to have GPS photo tracking or face recognition software. If you were hoping (like me) that iMovie would be more robust, think again. It would have been very easy for Apple to include two versions of iMovie: advanced and basic. Basic would be the default setting and advanced would include the features lost from the 06 version. It could be turned on or off for the best of both worlds. Instead I have iMovie HD installed on top of iLife 09. Waste of hard drive space.

iLife 09 doesn't offer any compelling reason to update if you have iLife 08. There aren't any improvement that are not relatively minor or obscure (face recognition for example). And there is one MASSIVE disadvatage, at least for those who prefer iMovie 06: installing iMovie 09 will cause iMovie 06 to become inoperable! You have no choice in the matter, and no prompt lets you know that you are losing iMovie HD by installing iLife 09. It just happens.

Why Apple doesn't allow the user to control how many or few features are available is beyond me. I'm not saying everyone should want all the features from iMovie 06, but for those of us that do, why not make them available? This sort of 'one size fits all' approach is really frustrating."
"Sometimes when I find myself critiquing Nancy Drew games, I realize how much variety this series has, while still never really moving it's roots; The sleuthing that we all love has relatively stayed the same, but the setting changes with every game. Whether it's a haunted mansion, or a ranch or even a train, HERInteractive takes on a new form of fun with each additional mystery, and while Secret of the Scarlet Hand is an older game in the series, and definitely not one of my favorites, there is still fun to be had with it, and orginiality is clearly evident.

Story: 6.5/10. Nancy lands an internship at a museum in Washington D.C, which is devoted to the Mayan culture and will soon be exhibiting a newly discovered monolith to the public. But, shortly before the exhibition, one of the museum's most treasured pieces is stolen from the museum, as well as a strange 'accident' that occurs involving the museum's epigrapher. It definitely wasn't one of my favorite plots, but was still somewhat interesting.

Setting: 6.5/10. It was definitely an interestingly original idea to have a Nancy Drew game take place in a museum specializing in Mayan culture. You also get to hope on a subway to visit other character's offices, a hospital and Nancy's hotel room. I personally thought that the museum was pretty boring, but maybe less boring as the game progressed, and I found things I didn't know were there before.

Characters: 6/10. The characters were pretty annoying this time around. The epigrapher who got amnesia was very irritating to care to and talk to, Taylor Sinclair, an art specialist, was very annoying, and Alejandro, an ambassador to the Mexican Consolate, was even more annoying to talk to.

Puzzles: 8.5/10. The puzzles were good this time around, and the only reason I'm saying this is that there's a pyramid inside the museum, and on each level on this part of the museum, there are different quizzes and games that you have to complete to progress to the next floor. This was a big part of the game and I LOVED it.

Activities: 6/10. There weren't that many activities, but the games in the pyrmaid were decent.

Ending: 6.5/10. The ending was obvious, and what you had to do to end the game was kind of confusing, and took me a few tries to get it right.

Total (averaged): 6.6 out of 10, averaged to....

6.5/10.

Although this game does have some originality and fun, it's too bland and boring for my taste, and I'd recommend new HERInteractive fans to go with another purchase for now."
"There are SO many things you can do with this software. I have an online hunting and camping store and this is great to help create flyers... they look SO professional! And it's easy to use. I used the Microsoft ""test drive"" to see how this software works and it's a good thing to do. I don't recommend the 60 day free trial ( I lost all my old Outlook emails when it expired .. if you know how to get around that, then go for it but the other ""online"" free trial they offer is just as good and you won't loose anything ). Like my Outlook 2007 review, this was a real treat for me and worth the price .. which again WAS LOWEST AT AMAZON, by a LOT. WORD, POWERPOINT, ONE NOTE (A Really Cool Feature!) .. all of it is great. If you need Office capabilities but can't afford the REALLY nice stuff, this works just fine. You will be happy with your purchase."
"Excellent Magazine.
I don't have Cable or satelite TV so I very rarely get to sit and watch the food network, so I don't always know the cooks mentioned in this magazine. However, I love this magazine. The pictures are bright and colorful. The recipes are almost always easy to follow and generally don't require unusual ingredients. Every recipe I have tried to make out of this magazine has always turned out. They often have a different or unusual take on a recipe- for example, instead of a traditional macaroni and cheese recipe they will have five ways to update macaroni and cheese. There might be a recipe for three cheese macaroni, crab and cheese macaroni, and some other unusual recipe.

Enjoy. Well worth the money."
"Kaspersky isn't my favorite antivirus. I find that it's scans are slow and that the interface isn't as user friendly as it could be. But the parental controls/filtering software bundled with other antivirus programs is lacking.

So I still find it slow and not the easiest to configure/use, but I have installed Kaspersky pure where people need both an antivirus and filtering software. Having separate filtering software seems to slow the computer more and can be a risk if your antivirus messes up your filtering software.

I haven't tried too hard to get around the filtering software, but most of the time it just being there persuades people not to go to blocked stuff. You can pick categories so you can choose what you block. I really like the fact that you don't have to have a separate administrator account in windows--that's a big plus to those with one account or who don't want to have to log off when they're done.

In conclusion, it may not be my favorite for just antivirus, but it make a compelling piece of software when you look at the filtering component too."
This year's product is much easier to edit than previous years. Override is also easier. Editing a form is very convenient. TurboTax has always been easy to use. It audits your return and compares your return with other U.S. averages. It allows you to file electronically (for a small fee).
One of few that have 8 ports.  It was a great price.  It worked right away and got our system up in running in no time.
"I got into too big a hurry when I bought this.  I installed it over Kaspersky Internet security 2010, and was offered 30 days of Kaspersky Internet security 2011, and then it would revert to just the anti-virus program."
"Very pleased with Uhuru Naturals Hair Growth Shampoo.  It stopped my hair loss, and adds volume.  My hair has even developed waves that it never had before, plus it's soft and silky. I'll certainly buy more of this excellent shampoo when I finish the bottle I have now.  I've already recommended it to friends. This shampoo is gentle to my baby fine hair and leaves it really clean."
Amazing photography! Great food ideas.
No problems with functionality but the 2015 version is slower.  Updating account is very slow.  There is a few second delay after entering or updating an entry.  I archived transactions prior to 2014 hoping that a reduced file size would improve performance but saw no difference.  It is annoying but not enough to prevent me from using the 2015 version.
"The marketing information makes this software look like it should be fabulous... lots of useful features that I would love to experiment with.  However, the software just doesn't work.  I will keep using my very old JASC version of this software instead."
The food there was really good. Buy gift cards on Amazon can save money with 5 percent cash back bonus.
I have an Airbnb.  This is perfect for guests.  The price is right and I can provide shampoo with little waist.  I appreciate this product
"Yes I now have two Pinnacle products that I should never have purchased.(the other one is the Studio 17 Ultimate) What was I thinking? The product performed before par and I found it to be a pain in the neck to actually do what I wanted it to which is to help me edit photos Simple right? That's what I thought After the fiasco of trying to get help for the problems I had with Studio 17 and being charged to get support, I just gave up. There are so many other programs out there that are far superior than Pinnacle Systems. I would suggest going to your local Best Buy or similar store where you can speak to someone in person (no charge) to compare programs to your needs. That is what I did after I through this in the garbage along with the Studio 17. Sorry Pinnacle..this was my last purchase with you"
"I'm a 20 year PC veteran who recently bought a Mac PowerBook.  I'm running Windows XP Pro on my other machines, but am finding OS X is more stable, has a cleaner interface, and is simpler to work with when installing software and hardware.  I'll probably switch totally to Mac over the next year, assuming more software becomes available.
Note that OS X is built around a Unix-core, which to me is a big plus.  What a pleasant surprise to not have to deal with the Windows registry and never-ending driver issues."
By far my favorite fragrance and this is the perfect size. Great for gifts too since it comes pre-packed with a ribbon.
great software love to clean up those photos
"The Family Tree Maker Deluxe for PC package includes main software (computer program) in the box, printed Companion Guide, and 3-mo membership trial (followed by an inflated rate) to Ancestry now valued at $60 ($20/mo) making the software alone free. The program is well designed and easy to use for its very intuitive interface (screen windows). It provides full access to Ancestry's database over the Internet thus necessary to be had. The package is by far the best of its kind on the market and set the standard in the field. The Platinum version includes a 6-month membership and Photo Album Plus photo editing software. The Essentials version includes only a 1-month membership trial (followed by an inflated rate) and no printed Companion Guide."
I sent this back about two or three weeks ago because it did not work on my computer. I had Kaspersky Anti-Virus on my computer before.
"Microsoft has made some minor improvements to this version of Windows.  It's a little faster but by no means fast.  It's has some graphic-interface improvements which are clearly ripped-off from Apple's Mac Operating System (OS), but instead of improving on them, Microsoft took that usability down and actually made it worse (it's like the kid who cheats in class but still gets a bad grade).

You'll notice that all the people giving this OS rave reviews are comparing Windows 7 to older versions of Windows.  So they're comparing this OS to Vista (now 3 years old) and/or XP (now 8-9 years old).  Why don't they compare it to the Mac OS[...]  Because if you don't already know, the Mac is simply a superior, thought-out, well-tested, design and creates a much better end-user-experience.

Wanna be frustrated all over again like you were with XP?  Get Windows 7.  Wanna be frustrated like you were with Vista?  Get Windows 7.  It's your money, and it's your time (your life) - wanna spend both being frustrated and pissed-off and down-right angry because your expensive computer with expensive software isn't working like you'd simply expect it to... well, by all means, buy Windows 7 and continue to allow Microsoft to make your life miserable.

I have to use PCs - and Macs - I know the difference.  It wasn't until recently that I started using the Mac.  FYI, you can ""dual-boot"" a Mac so it runs both Windows and the Mac OS - so if you want, you can do your own comparison.  Or you can just ask a Mac owner and get their opinion.

Microsoft has been beating up their customers since day one - they don't love you.  They don't even like you.  They seemingly could really care less about you, your time, your money, your life.  It's your call...  I'm here telling you all this because, since I work so much with computers, I'm one of those people who's been beaten up badly by Microsoft, and I'm here trying to ""save"" others from that pain.

Best wishes to you all."

"For the first time in many years I have been pleased with a Microsoft Windows family OS.  When Windows XP came out I obtained what I was really expecting, a very solid, stable and enhanceable system.
Windows XP is based on the Windows 2000 code base with several major multimedia, administrative tools and security enhancements among other things.
This is really the closest you can get to a truly standard OS for all types of users, except system administators obviously.  We are getting closer to not having different Windows flavors running around anymore.
The acceptance of this OS will gradually relieve developers from having to design multi-platform applications, a major headache in the past.  As of this writing, Windows 95 has almost been phased out, and almost every piece of software is written for Windows XP (Home and Professional)
I've tested this OS on my personal laptop (Thinkpad T-21) and several Pentium family desktops (P-III 750Mhz and P-IV 2.4Ghz) with many different software and hardware combinations without major issues.  Software drivers are becoming quickly available for all types of hardware.  In terms of software applications, I had to wait a bit longer for a few applications to become XP compatible.
As with any OS, the compatibility issues were higher when the OS was released, but now you will not find as many, unless you still own very old pieces of hardware and software.  This is in my opinion the primary factor when deciding wether to upgrade or to stay where you are.
I will not get into the features of the OS, as they are very well described by Amazon and other reviewers, what I can tell you is what I consider the major highlights of this OS:
* Great multimedia features - MovieMaker, Media Player.  Windows Explorer has also been expanded with options to manage digital media such as pictures and music.  Multimedia devices are installed and configured easier than ever
* CD Burning options built in - Creating a music or data CD is as easy as drag and drop.  It may not be the most efficient burning system, but its a good place to start
* Administrative Tools - The Disk administrator, along with the disk defragmenter are two enhanced tools that I rely on with XP
* Windows Update - Microsoft has been updating the OS frequently with many security fixes and tools updates and enhancements. You can set up XP to update your system periodically
* Networking - Setting up a network is much easier now.  A firewall is also built in as part of the network security features new in XP
* System Help - The help tool has been enhanced to search not only locally on the PC but through the Internet as well.  General Help Topics are very detailed and descriptive with many illustrations.  Great improvement here.
* Wizards - Many more settings are performed with wizards.  Is like filling an electronic questionnaire, then XP takes over the rest of the configuration steps based on your answers.
And simply the looks.  Icons are more colorful, and they take  advantage of higher end video cards with more color options.  You can select display settings to look like the old Windows or the new XP look.
In terms of performance, I admit that Windows by design, does not consider low end machines and it may seem slow on low RAM machines.  I would definitely recommend having more than 256MB of RAM and a high end Pentium processor (P3 and up) for acceptable performance.  Fortunately, there are options to tweak performance settings by eliminating the sometimes unnecessary display effects.
I think at this time, you may be assured that Windows XP will be the best choice for you.  Don't hesitate to buy it, taking into consideration the points I mentioned above.

"Was the best at it's time, if you like the media center stay with windows 7."
"I'm a longtime Norton fan, but another household member swears by McAfee. They've been using the free internet security provided by the cable company, so I got them this to upgrade to. It definitely does the job it's supposed to and works well. Their computer runs smoothly and they never get viruses. McAfee seems to have the status of Burger King in a MacDonald's world, but they make a great product you can feel comfortable putting your trust in."
"I am a little disappointed with the latest version of Photo Express.  I use Photo Shop Elements and Photo Express for various projects.  The main difference I found between the products it that Photo Express does a little too much for me without asking and without my consent.  I understand that the auto saving over old photos and other 'convenience' features are there to promote ease of use, however, as someone who is a little more hands on that the average user of these products I am more annoyed by Photo Express than I am enamored of its convenience.  The bottom line is Photo Express is going to appeal more to people who want a product that does everything for them and thus makes it easy to use while Photoshop Elements is a lot more hands on and a little more complicated.  Both of these programs have their flaws and uses, but if I were to buy just one I would stick with Photo Shop Elements over Photo Express."
"The software installed and worked well on a Windows 8 64 bit system.  It is designed in a logical well thought out way.  The program was very easy to learn and to use.  The software is very comprehensive and provides a huge number of features.  Lots of power for the price.  One thing I especially appreciate about Corel products is that they have been very good about correcting any bugs promptly through service releases.

Excellent value and highly recommended."
"I'm pretty much an amateur when it comes to photo editing. A little fix here, clear up red eye & blemishes, nothing really complex. I have used both PaintShop Pro X5 and Adobe Photoshop and like them equally. It can take a little to get used to, especially if like me, you're not adept at editing photos. However, it gets much easier as you play around with the software more. I had a lot of fun cleaning up our old Disney World photos. I like the guided options, and found them helpful. The price is reasonable for what you're able to do with it."
It's a gift card!
"THE QUICK TAKE:  The Sony Movie Studio 13 Suite provides a bundle with a lot of features for a very reasonable price.  If you're looking for software that can handle a wide range of tasks, and are willing to put some time into learning how to use it, it's a very good choice.

FULL REVIEW: I find I form long-term relationships with software. ;-) Personally, I don't want to invest the time in learning my way around a particular piece of software only to bump into its limitations - to find out that it doesn't perform, or is lacking important features.  So I usually narrow my options to proven software with a balance of performance and usability, but with a bias toward features and performance.  If that fits your needs, Sony Movie Studio 13 is a good option.

SIMPLE VS ADVANCED:  Movie Studio does have the option to choose a Simple or Advanced interface, so it may help the transition for those looking to start by using a limited range of features, and have the ability to switch to the Advanced interface later on.  (Or not - the software is a good value even without using all the features. I know I'll never use all of them.)

VERY GOOD SOUND EDITOR: SoundForge offers a nice range of features if you need to do additional editing on the sound.  You can read reviews for it at the Amazon page for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sony-Sound-Forge-Audio-Studio-10/dp/B003L51CUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sony Sound Forge Audio Studio 10</a>.  Note that it is not a multi-track editor.

Besides the video and audio editor, a lot of other features are included.  But those are the two components I use, and those alone make it worthwhile for me.

TOUCH ENABLED:  It's also not a feature I use, but if you're interested in touch enabled editing, it's a new feature in Movie Studio 13, so you may want to look into reviews of that feature.

CHECK YOUR HARDWARE:  Sony provides hardware requirements that are somewhat useful with respect to graphics cards (you need a reasonably good one).  I wish they'd provide better  guidance on that, and with respect to processor and RAM. As far as I can tell, they provide the hardware requirements for editing low-res video.  Sure, the software might run on that hardware, but that's not what people are buying this software to do.  I have a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/EVGA-GeForce-GTX-750/dp/B00IDG3NDY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">EVGA GeForce GTX 750</a>&nbsp;in a desktop with an i5 3450 processor (mid- to upper-level i5) and 32GB of RAM. While you might not need that much RAM, I'd suggest installing at least 8GB to 12GB if you can."

"I have two desktops, one running Win XP (Dell Dimension 4600, 2.8 Ghz, one running Win Vista, 2.4 Ghz dual core).  I ran the full scan starting at the same time on both using Norton Internet Security 2007.  The XP version scanned almost 600,000 items in less than 2 hours.  The Vista version is still running after almost 8 hours and has managed only about 233,000 items.  The Vista PC is normally a fast machine.  It seems that Norton has some work to do to take advantage of dual core technology.  Had I known it was going to be this slow (not the first time, either), I'd have opted for ZoneLabs.  Zonelabs also found spamware that was not detected by Norton.  Granted that it was low-risk, but Norton should have found this kind of stuff as well.

I'd probably look more carefully next time before buying a security suite."
My neice and nephew loved these magazines. Great learning tool or girls and boys. They enjoyed the jokes and collecter cards that they could cut out and safe. Fun and makes a nice subscription to look forward to.
A hose was included with our machine so we didn't need this. Otherwise it would have been fine.

"Writing this review has been on my to-do list for a long time. That's because this is a wonderful product, with one big drawback. I've been hoping either to find other drawbacks that could justify a less enthusiatic review, or a solution to that one flaw.
CorelDRAW Graphics Suite will do everything you want it to do, whether you're creating brochures or websites or scrapbook pages. The learning curve is no steeper that it has to be for a product with this robust a range of options. The images and fonts included will come in handy over and over.
The only problem is: everyone else you work with will probably be using Adobe. You will have issues when you collaborate with others, you won't find tutorials that work for you, you won't be able to swap tips at the water cooler.
If that doesn't matter to you, then this is pretty much the perfect graphics package."
"Bird Watchers Digest is in my opinion a must have magazine for anyone that has any interest in birds.  From the backyard feeder to the world traveler observer, BWD has enough content in all areas to satisfy anyones particular interest, on any level.  There is even a regular section in each issue dedicated to back yard birding.  It isn't a magazine that is at all snobby and considers back yard novices peasants.  On the other hand, it is also a very technical and educational periodical for those that are advanced enough to actually take advantage of the many world wide travel suggestions and deals that are offered throughout the book. I first picked up some BWD back issues on Ebay and enjoyed it enough to order a regular subscription.  I was particularly impressed by its compact size, similar to Readers Digest.  It can be easily carried along in a purse or bag for traveling, and of course it makes a perfect addition to your bathroom library. The only caution that I would suggest to anyone that decides to buy a subscription is to pass on the offer of the digest newsletter that you can subscribe too for every other month that BWD isn't offered.  At $16 a for 6 issues it is not worth it at all.  Its a very thin, (about 10 pages) pamphlet style publication that has as many ads in it as helpful info.  Its a rip off in all honesty. I let my own subscription to it lapse after the first year.  You are much better off subscribing to the BWD email that is sent out periodically that is free, and loaded with article highlights and helpful info.  Overall I highly recommend BWD for all bird enthusiasts on all levels.  I think you will find yourself looking forward to each and every issue..."
"Used turbo tax higher versions for many years with decreasing satisfaction each year.  This appears to be systemic with Intuit as the same has happened with their Quicken product.  Each new version seems to be slower, more buggy, and more error prone than the year before.  Turbo Tax has never reliably downloaded my tax info either from the institutions, or my Quicken program, but has seemed to run fairly reliably, and accurately, with manual input of data.  This year that is not the case.  I have had to override the program several times for incorrect data entry, and been caught twice in endless run arounds where the program endlessly circles.  Turbo Tax has never correctly calculated the taxable portion of an employee contributory pension since I started using it.  I also notice the Intuit corporate greed evident in slick upgrade and price increase schemes.  The ""special"" customer upgrade price is always twice as high as the retail cost everywhere else by March.  I find Inuit's attitude toward customers, and business model very annoying.  I wish that they would properly debug their product, charge a reasonable price, and quit the sleazy marketing."
"We have been working to try to install this for two weeks and we give up.

I purchased the last version of Dragon and my son with dysgraphia has been using it. I was excited to have the new one.

We are trying to install on a Samsung laptop, 8 GB RAM I 3 core processor 2.0 GHz running windows 8.

It says there is a CD on the drive but does not recognize it to start the installation."
This is great software
"Great for a quick gift for a party.  Everyone might not love Wendy's, but few people will refuse to eat there...and everyone eats, so it's not like they won't use it!"
"In my view, this product is now useless UNLESS your computer already has Office 2010 already installed and you can merely enter the code you are buying with this product.  If you need to download Office 2010, good luck.  I am very computer savvy and found Microsoft now only supports 2013 downloads. I found other places where one could obtain links to download 2010 and used on that was supposedly relatively reputable. After installing the software and using up my code, AVAST popped up (love Avast) and said I had a rootkit type virus and it needed to run a boot scan on next start-up.  So, in my experience, this product is now useless UNLESS you already have 2010 Office installed (as in preinstalled) on your computer. Otherwise, you are taking a risk of finding a virus free place to get a copy of 2010 onto your computer.  (Or, it would also work if you have an Office 2010 Disk handy where that disk has been used but you can use this new code with it.)"
"If you look at the definition of bloatware in the dictionary, there should be a picture of this product. This security suite hogs the computer's resources and wraps itself around it so you can't get rid of it easily. In essence, this software is the worse virus that ever hit my PC. I was shocked when I counted almost 100 threads belonging to this internet suite when the PC was idle. 100 threads!!! Especially if you have an older PC, or one with not a lot of available resources, this software will slow it down to a crawl.

Another issue is when Live Update fails or does not complete for whatever reason (PC crash, reboot, out of disc, internet connection disrupted, etc), there is a chance this software suite will start behaving unpredictably. This is ironic since this is the software suite that is supposed to be protecting your computer, yet it cannot reliably update itself when there are problems during the update.

Perhaps their notion of protection is to slow your PC down to a grind, so if a virus or hacker manages to break through, it will be so slow they won't be able to do a lot of damage - this is my attempt at humor :-)

But to be fair, this suite seems to work most of the time. I did not have any viruses or firewall breaches - at least as far as I can tell. It has some level of customization and control, although you cannot turn off some of their annoying reminders. With rebates and bundles you can get it at a low price, but as always with mail-in rebates, you have to keep copies and records in case it is not received or lost in the mail."
"I wanted to write a review now before tax season is over.  I will update this review as needed.

So far it has worked great.  It installed no problem on Windows Vista.  it found last year's tax return on my PC and imported that--no problems.  It also imported my data from Quicken 2012 smooth as butter, all my stock trades came in and my capital gains for the year were calculated automatically..a beautiful thing.

Now, whether all this automatic importing is correct is another matter.  I'll need to review all this as my statements at my brokers become available.  However, at this time everything appears to be working great."
"Norton Internet Security is the ONLY anti-virus software I trust for my PCs. Sure, it costs a bit more than most of those other competitors, but my peace-of-mind is worth it! New features include ""Safe Web"" which checks each website for validity and security; ""Identity Safe"" which can manage your passwords; and a Symantec website you can use to check the validity of a suspect URL. It even gives you a map of your home network. Many more features are included.  I highly recommend!!"
"If I think this product is worth less than 1 star, why did I buy it?  Because I had the 2007 version and it worked ok, although weak on spyware detection. I had a 2 year license and would have been happy to simply extend it for a reasonable fee.  Unfortunately Kaspersky is greedy beyond belief and wanted more for a simple license renewal than I could buy a whole new boxed version at a local brick and mortar store.

I checked Amazon and they had AV 2009 for under twelve bucks (unexplicably today they are selling the same ""old version"" for sixty bucks. What is up with that?).  So it was an easy decision to pay the twelve rather than the outrageous renewal fee.  MISTAKE!

As others have pointed out my computer immediately slowed down to the speed of something from 1963.  Okay, I know didn't have computers in 1963 but you get my point.  This version doesn't do anything different, why is it such a resource hog?

As others have pointed out, KAV2009 does NOT play well with Microsoft Office.  I immediately began having problems saving files because the AV software was trying to protect the file.  How can anyone work with MS Office if they can't save files?  If I turn KAV2009 off, Office works perfectly, turn it back on and the problem happens again. There is no doubt that the AV software is at fault.  How can any software manufacturer try to sell a product that doesn't work with MS Office?

I've had it for about a week and simply can't live with the turtle-slow performance so even though I have almost a full year to go I have ordered another brand to replace it.  I have nothing good to say about KAV2009."
"This is scary. I have owned most every version of Corel for 20 plus years. This was a biggest mistake EVER. Create a restore point if you are stupid enough to be like me. I bought it without reading reviews, my past use was what I wen by. Creator 2 is still on one of my machines and works fine. This version was hard to install, and has screwed up my computer. Every web page needs to be reloaded at least once, sometimes twice to actually display correctly. And this is day one, after a week to get it installed."
Nice product
Absolutely fantastic program. Beyond all my expectations. I recommend buying it and learning how to use it.
"TurboTax Premier for tax year 2005 is a notable improvement over recent years. Gone are most of the self-aggrandizing promotions and registration issues of recent years; in the place of all the self-promotion, I found the 2005 package to be extremely stable, useful, and generally quite logical.

Installing the program was uneventful and straightforward, as was downloading the state product (in my case Minnesota.) Updating the program was likewise a non-issue. I found the interview this year to be more logical and user-friendly than in years past. I have a fairly intricate return, and I had very few issues navigating the interview. The one place that I did have some confusion (cleared up by ""Your Income Tax 2006"" by J.K. Lasser) was in entering qualified tuition expenses, as the program gives you two separate possibilities to enter them. That is a fairly trivial issue and affects few people, but does point out that there is still room for improvement in the program (especially in the ""help"" features.) I also have a perpetual question (that is really insignificant, but makes me wonder ""What were they thinking?""): why does TurboTax make you enter your phone number, but fails to print it in the correct space on your 1040 (making you print it by hand), yet on the state return it does print it out? These are obviously very minor observations, and in no way detract from my recommendation.

I have tried TaxCut in years past (though I did not do a direct comparison with TaxCut for the 2005 tax year), and while it is cheaper, I still believe that TurboTax is the better value. It is complete (especially the Premier program), fairly intuitive, and produces accurate returns as well as very useful worksheets for your records. TurboTax is fairly expensive, but I believe it's worth it.

TurboTax for the 2005 tax year is a marked improvement over years past, and I recommend it for preparation of all but the most mind-bogglingly complex returns. For those, I recommend a CPA."
"Okay, there are a lot of 1 star reviews on here apparently from people who haven't even USED the product and are upset that they can't afford it!  Please make your decision based on a review from someone who has actually used the product.  I can't imagine putting a review on a product when I haven't actually used it.

I agree that this is expensive, but as an individual and not a business/professional, I know that this product was not meant for me.  This is Office Professional - it has a LOT of features.  It is not designed for users who are mainly going to only use Word and Excel.  That is what some of the other versions are for.  If you don't need Access or Publisher or Outlook, then yes, this would be really overpriced.  I'm not going to complain about the price of the Adobe Creative Suite when the only thing I'm going to do is remove red eye and crop photos.  This software is designed for businesses and institutions.

The previous reviewer (Surgery 100 ""ADJ"") has done an excellent job of reviewing and covering the new features.  Also, I suggest checking out the related media videos on the product page.

The biggest addition is the ability to link and share information via the web.  You can link docs, notes, spreadsheets, share presentations via the web.  Lots of capabilities to share and collaborate.

I love using OneNote.  I use it for a lot of things and I think it is possibly the most underutilized program in the suite.  People may think it is for taking notes in class.  I'm not a student - it can be really helpful for organizing lots of different types of information.  Now I can share my notebooks via the web, a feature that CAN be really helpful for students and non-students alike.

A couple of features I like is the people pane on Outlook integrated with the Outlook Social Connector.  This allows me to link my contacts to social networks (facebook, LinkedIn) and display information from the social network on the people pane.  So, when I open an email from someone who has a fb profile, I can see all their posted items, previous emails, facebook statuses.

I also really like the customizable ribbons, though I'm still working on how to get them best customized to meet my needs.  The great thing is that I can.

Overall, there are some ""neato"" features and the ability to share online can be very helpful.  If you already have Office 2007, this might not be worth the upgrade price, unless you get a good deal.  However, this will be well worth the price if you have Office 2003 or earlier."
"Love everything about the Microsoft Outlook 2010. But have only one issue is the Crop for pictures is more harder to learn then it is with Microsoft Outlook 2007 it is still easlier to get it working than Microsoft Outlook 2010. I have not gotten it to work and it frustrated me that it not working when I need it most on the Microsoft Outlook 2010. Other than this is a great product and would tell friends about it.
Thanks again."
"The program installs easily, and scheduling backups was as easy as following the on-screen directions. As usual with Acronis though, a Secure Zone cannot be created on an external (USB) drive, so all the advantages of a Secure Zone are lost with this installation. I haven't had to restore from version 11, but have from version 9, and that was wonderful (or better)."
"I am a huge fan of Norton products - and have used it exclusively for all my personal devices since around 2003. The fact that this software is provided free by my cable provider is simply icing on the cake.

The latest iteration of this suite is just as great. I am running it on a 7-year old Core Duo 2 with 2GB RAM (Win 7 x64), and it still runs like a champ without hogging my system's resources.

The old standby features are all still there - my favorite being Norton's File Insight which gives you a trust rating on downloaded files, Quick/Full scans, and the user interface retains the familiar tabbed-window look.

The new Backup feature also follows very familiar idioms for this category of software. You pick the What (files and folders), Where (the destination), and When (the frequency), and it does the rest.

Overall, this is a recommended upgrade to a software staple."
"I've been using TurboTax for about 5 years (and Quicken since its first version), and this version is the best ever.  I'm amazed at the changes since last year, and the simplicity of doing my taxes this way.

ItsDeductible is a big bonus, if you itemize deductions.  I use it throughout the year to track both cash donations, and donations of ""stuff.""  At tax time, it's so simple to import the data and watch the effect on the final taxes.

Did you know that you can use one license for everyone in your household?  Unless you e-file, there are no additional fees for additional returns prepared with TurboTax.

Overall, TurboTax is brilliant and simple.  It's actually fun to prepare your taxes!"
"As an Excel devotee, I can say that Microsoft Accounting Professional 2008 is an easy convert for someone who's never used accounting software. It has a variety of templates that allow you to set up ways to monitor and track expenses. It has features like how to create purchase orders, track inventory, and run payroll, etc. As a small business owner (very small, employees = 1), I didn't really need all the extra features, but the ones that I did use were pretty intuitive. It does, however, allow me to bill clients an invoice using Microsoft Outlook, and with a nice, professional looking template to boot. It provides easy integration with Excel, allowing me to transfer business reports between the two seamlessly. As a whole, I wish I'd gone with the Express, which is the free version, because supposedly it's got less junk that I don't need to bog down my time, but for the features, I'd recommend Accounting 2008 to a small business owner."
"Just like any other gift card, got it and it works fine."
my go to photo editing software. works with windows 10 pro 64bit.
"I upgraded from Paperport 9 (having used versions 5 and 7 previously). Unlike those who experienced difficulty with installation, or who complained of problems once the program was up and running, I had no such difficulties. Of all versions I have used in the past 15 years, this was the easiest to install and most glitch free. I have only used this version a few days, so I am just getting used to the changes which have taken place since version 9 (which I also found quite problem free). My only reason for upgrading was I messed up doing some long overdue system maintenance which resulted in corrupting essential program files. I misplaced my version 9 installation disk and was unable to find a replacement at Amazon.com or Ebay, otherwise I would have continued to use the older program.

There are some changes in the latest one, requiring study and experimentation. All in all, however, I don't believe any of the new stuff will present much of a challenge. The current program is running much faster than the earlier rendition on my now antiquated XP computer. I am fairly certain PP14.5 (to which the program updated with the first automatic maintenance update) will be at least as useful, if not more so than all the previous versions. To my surprise and delight it even works as well with my Windows 98 scanner (a Visioneer OneTouch 8600), which was packaged with my first copy of Paperport. I am loathe to part company with the Visioneer, as I consider my several newer Canon scanners inferior and less convenient for daily use. But, then, I heartily subscribe to the old saw, ""If it works, don't fix it!"""
Quick Shipment and Works.
"I write a lot of papers for school and when I upgraded to a new computer, I found that my MS Office license wasn't transferable.  I was offered this product to try and...well, it works fine.  It takes a little getting used to because of the interface being different but my papers get printed and delivered just like I do it in Word, and my spreadsheets look great.  I also have not found any problems opening Word or Excel documents with this program.  Since I'm not using it in an office environment, I can't review the other special features involved but I have to assume that they will work fine if I ever need them.
Overall, I like the product and would highly recommend it to anyone needing an office suite of sorts."
Bought for a graduation gift. I am sure she will get good use out of. amazon has so much to offer.
"I'm using Win7Pro x64.  When it works, it works.  However, incompatibility issues can make this version of Windows a nightmare if you have legacy USB and audio gear from previous editions -- including Vista.

Unlike previous editions, what I'm seeing with Win7 x64 is a very slow adoption rate by OEM manufacturers. In the past, they were all in a hurry to jump on the bandwagon.  I guess this time, everyone it tired of the game and holding off for as long as possible before supporting this new version of Windows.  Frankly, it looks like the same nightmare Vista users endured.

I wish I had held off this version of Windows until 2011. If what you have works, don't break it with an upgrade until you can go to the store and Win 7 support on most all the gadget boxes."
"I installed Norton Utilities 16.0 from the CD and the install went fine. Then, I ran the 1-click system optimization/health thing... it found some registry problems, as I expected and had it fix them. Unfortunately it also decided that some things I did not want deleted should be... all histories from all applications, etc. I like to use my 'recent' files selections in many apps. Well, they were all gone. Not just internet browsing history, that would be fine. But last files used in Photoshop, in Word, etc. NOT okay.

Then it said I should defrag the HDs, and when I said to do that, I got a popup warning that 'speed disk' (which I assume is defragmentation??) will delete ALL Windows System Restore points. So, I said, stop. There is NO reason whatsoever to delete system restore points, rather, it should CREATE them before running any sort of fix. I couldn't find any way to do a defrag without the deletions.

I tried the 'find duplicate files'. It was totally indiscriminate, finding files which are shared and parts of applications. It found thousands. No way was I going to go through that list to see what should be removed and what should stay. And there was no way that I could find to do an advanced search - to exclude certain types. There was a minimal search modifier, but it was grossly insufficient.

I suppose this might be good for someone who has no idea what to do with their computer, and doesn't really use it much. But for anyone who is a heavy user (I work on my machine from home) this won't do the trick, and in my opinion, could actually make problems worse if you don't have knowledge that is NOT provided with the utilities."
"I've been running this for a few months now and I have nothing but good things to say.  The interface is pretty simple, it runs scans quickly and doesn't seem to hog a lot of resources.  I'm running on a Win 7 Pro machine with a Core i5.  Whereas with Norton, I always could tell when scan stared, with Kaspersky I only notices if I check, or I get a report at the end of a scan.

Other than a few email viruses it hasn't reported much.  I still have Norton on the system, and I run a few scans occasionally to see if Kaspersky has missed anything: so far nothing.

The only negative I could give is that a power user might find doing ""deep tweaks"" to be a little more frustrating, but I think the average user will be pretty happy with the streamlined interface.  Most the reputable review sites give Kaspersky high marks for detection, which is most of what I care about, followed by performance.  Overall this does everything I want.

One thing I will note is that Internet Security Suites seem born to have conflicts with different systems.  Sometimes what works for me on one system crashes another.  Be prepard to scrap any Internet security software you buy if you system doesn't react well.  It just seems to be part of the game."
"I'm erasing my former review, writing a new one, and changing my rating from 2-STARS to 3-STARS (meaning okay).  I think the program may possibly be doing what it claims so I also purchased usage for a second year.

I gave one of my older computers to a neighbor kid and used Drive Scrubber to remove everything from the hard drive.  I then used the software that came with the old computer to restore it to a like new condition.  I don't actually know if criminal investigators, or information hackers, can restore any of the erased data or not.  But for me, at least in this instance, it doesn't matter.

But understand, I cannot prove that the program actually works.  For sure, its not perfect.  For one thing, when I analyze a disk before erasing deleted data, its result is over-printed on the text and cannot be read.  This is clearly a glitch in the program.  It existed in the first copy I installed, and it exists in the new copy I installed after removing the first - even after downloading the newest version.  This glitch of course, could be caused by my own computer or other software corrupting the program.  I just don't have the computer knowledge to know one way or the other.

Anyway, the program is cheap, uses little computer resources, and may be performing as advertised.  I just cannot know for sure.  You pay your money and you take your chances."
"You don't have to live in New York to enjoy the New Yorker. Most of the content in the New Yorker can be applied nationally. The feature articles in the magazine have a depth, research, and accuracy that can not be found in other magazines. I love reading the fiction, and viewing the witty comics. Like most New Yorkers this magazine leans slightly to the left.

Pros
- Fact-checking
- Accuracy
- Fiction

Cons
- A little pricey"
"Norton finally comes of age.

This home product integrates their Symantec Enterprise features, and detections into the home version. Leveraging extensive, powerful hardware in the cloud for superior detections. Norton now has fingerprinting, and can recognize malware before other products get signatures for them!

VERY light on system resources, and overall feel of the system. This is Norton like it has never been before!"
Tried a lot of shoes for cross training and these were the best!
Great Product; does wonders for colored treated hair.
Perfect
"I believe that Norton Security is one of the best software security packages on the market! Initially, I agreed with other customers about being disappointed that Norton no longer provides the disc. But then I learned that they provide 2-powerful tools (Free of charge to anyone that wants to use them) NBRT (Norton Bootable Recovery Tool) and NPE (Norton Power Eraser) on their website. NBRT allows one to do the same things you used to need the DVD to do, but it's even more powerful. NBRT is versatile. You can install it on a DVD, or make an ISO, or make a bootable jump drive. When you run it, it updates the file to use the latest signatures for the scan if your PC is connected to the I-net (I don't remember the DVD doingt that). If you create the bootable jump drive and install NPE on it, you have the option to run either. If you want to know just how engaged Symantec is with cyber security, read ""Countdown to Zero Day"" by Kim Zetter. They have people working for them all over the world, and it's good that they do! You have 2-options: you can whine, or you can research!!"
"Let me set the back story...I have been a PC user since 1982. I have used windows since NT 3.51 and always considered myself a Microsoft guy.

That changed this year with the release of Vista and the subsequent release of Leopard. I changed over to Mac and didn't look back. That being said I felt I needed some familiarity with my computer. I could have just used my windows version of Office with Parrells, but I figured I bought a Mac I should use mac programs....

Fast forward to today. I simply love office on the Mac (and my Mac too). The program performs exactly like I am used to with my windows version (except it doesn't crash)

If you are a recent convert I highly recommend getting this product and 2008 once it comes out."
"Before you buy this, you should be aware that Intuit charges $15 for each e-file, Federal or state.  There's no free e-filing with Turbo Tax, period.  Seriously, I think $15 is a lot to pay for e-filing.  There are websites that give you completely free e-filing; my favorite is TaxAct (at taxactonline dot com).  With TaxAct, you get the complete Federal plus state package for $7.95, which includes e-filing.  Or you can use their standard package to prepare Federal and e-file for free, with *NO* income restriction!

I don't work for any of these companies, nor any tax-related company, nor any such entity.  I just don't think it's right for Intuit to charge customers such a ridiculously high fee for e-filing, whereas people can e-file for free elsewhere.  BTW, if you use Turbo Tax to prepare your return, you'll have to use Intuit's e-filing service if you want to e-file; you can't just take your file to another website and expect that website to do it for you.  I used TaxAct in the past and they are very dependable.  You can find reviews of TaxAct products in major magazines and on major websites.

Good luck."
Cute. Gift Card works fine. The box is cute.
"I love these!  I ordered an 8.5 which is my normal shoe size and they fit great.  I used them for my strength training class and they performed well, and they are sooooo pretty!  Comfortable, low profile and stylish!"
"Through the last 20 years my husband and I have used a lot of office software. Right now, WordPerfect is my default, and OpenOffice is his. However, he switches to WordPerfect office for some specific things, and I don't use OpenOffice for anything, because WordPerfect does everything I need.
It saves nicely in a lot of formats and has all the applications you expect from a good office suite. It's intuitive to use, and common enough that if you do get stuck, it's easy to find a solution to the problem without having get customer support.
Where WordPerfect excels for me, and the reason my husband switches to it every so often is in straight word processing. In this, it's so much better than Microsoft Office. Most of my writing is craft instructions, and it was easy to create the various templates I wanted, and it's easy to format the documents professionally.
About PDFs- I don't use the program to make PDFs, my husband does and he's happy with the pdfs he makes using it. Generally I save in .doc format then create the pdfs using Acrobat for greater control and the ability to add in fillable text fields easily.
I still prefer the full version, because a lot of my use is commercial, and the Home and Student edition isn't meant to be used that way. However, it has the same functions, and works just as well at a lower price making it a great choice for students."
with stock transactions buy/sell you can no longer e-file but we pay for e-file. is intuit that crazy to raise the price and for some eliminate e-file even though the user paid for it. why does intuit every other yer or so come out with a customer hit that costs them customers. h&r block here i come.
"I've been running Norton on my desktop for the past few years. I thought I would try this and see if I like it better. It does seem to use less resources and seems to pick up malware well. It doesn't quite have the bells and whistles that I have with the Norton. I can't get too technical on this review because I'm not a tech wiz, but it seems like McAfee runs smoother and doesn't slow down my computer as much as Norton does when it's running. I never got a virus while using Norton 360, so it'll be interesting to see how well McAfee protects me compared to Norton. So far I like it."
"This is very easy to use and to install. You can create high quality animation. If you enjoy creating animation this will be great. Feather you are a pro or a beginner, you will enjoy this program and aloof the features that go along with it.  You can also draw charts and graphs and add animation and give them life for your presentation. I would recommend this."
I liked this magazine for the articles are great and it is ideal for science students who are curious and it is also educational for anyone who reads it. I recommended this to anyone who love to read and learn the breakthroughs of science and medicine.
"WW has so many great herb and natural remedies. They also have healthy eating ideas for people, usually based on recently published books.  I appreciate the stories of loving families who adopt children, and  of people who have been helped by their angels.

However, the horoscopes and some of the disgustingly unhealthy recipes full of sugar and dyes are incongruent with the rest of the magazine. Woman's World, please get rid of the junk recipes and astrology.

Other than that, I really enjoy all the great and well-researched articles and look forward to reading my weekly issues. I find WW to be the most helpful, interesting, and uplifting magazine out there. God bless!"

"I am an artsy type, but also lazy. I loved art class in school because I had a whole room full of supplies, though I hated cleaning up. I was really looking forward to using this software because it simulates all of that messy stuff which is fun to use but not convenient. Fun times ahead!

It's mostly a fairly straightforward painting/editing program, but it has a whole ton of ""brushes"", both simulated real art tools (paint brushes, pens, spatulas, airbrushing, etc) and some wacky fun stuff like the ""image hose"" which lays down a trail of objects. If you're a skilled hand artist, or planning to become one, many of the brush types will be very useful in creating digital images which do look very much like they were created with brush, pen, or sponge strokes.

However, for what I expected to be a pretty high-end piece of software, I was disappointed with some quirks.

To avoid using the word ""tool"" (often used to refer to editing tools) and also avoid calling everything a ""brush"", I will refer to all simulated things as implements.

Some of the implements are too perfect and constant, and obvious patterns show. The ""loaded palette knife 2"" strokes with a pattern you might expect from a scraping painter's knife, but it NEVER CHANGES, down to the pixel. And unlike some of the other implements, there's no rounding or smoothing of the stroke to make it look convincing. It's exactly what you would get by copying and dragging a row of pixels in a paint program on an old DOS box. See the uploaded image, it's loaded with patterned artifacts. Utterly useless. Some others had similar problems, but I remembered this knife as the worst.

Some implements which rotate to match the stroke direction have a similar problem. They are completely 2-dimensional, and while they make delightful swirls of texture, they ALWAYS start and end with a completely flat row of pixels, just as no object in the univers would if used to draw. Again, it looks like the obvious result of a paint program.

One feature I was initially happy to see is the ability to zoom in with the mouse's scroll wheel. Why that isn't universal I have no idea, and being a detail hawk I am constantly zooming in and out at various points. Great! But it's silly, because using your scroll wheel will only zoom in to the exact center of your screen. The program doesn't care where your cursor is! So you have to first drag over to center whatever area you want to zoom in on. How did they not think to make it zoom in on the area I am pointing at? Yes, I can drag to the area first, but zooming in & out is something I might do literally hundreds of times while working on one image.

I was not able to figure out why trying to pick the crop tool sometimes jumps my focus down to the canvass layer, which is surely the last layer anyone would want to crop and move. Unlike some other things, there was no popup telling me why it didn't want to let me crop the paint layer.

Here's another silly thing. The escape key does not un-select things. If you use the select tool, and have the dotted box around an area then either perform some action or change your mind, you want to un-select the area. In every other program I have used, either ESC or ENTER will unselect the area and let you move on with your life, which is handy because you can draw with your right hand and hit keys like that with your left. In Corel, you have to use the ""reset tool"" on the menu bar. Again, it might not seem like a big deal but it interrupts the flow of an action you might do hundreds of times while working on a serious project. And it's not like the ESC key does anything else.

And finally, though the number of tools is impressive at first, it's all about buying upgrades. Want more brushes? Hand over a chunk of cash. It looks like the ""image hose"" is the same, and you can only use leaves and tires so many times before your work looks like a child got on your computer when you weren't there.  When the program first started, this really convenient learning interface popped up. Oh good, something to get me started! Not really, they're all ""30 lecture"" bundles you have to buy. No free 5-minute intro to using Corel's mediocre interface.

Overall, it's got some good stuff. But don't think you're buying into some great thing. They think they're selling you a bare-bones system, some of which can be addressed with upgrades and some maybe not."
Have used Turbo-tax for decades. Wouldn't think of doing taxes any other way.
"This product does exactly what it says and in a smoother than average manner. If you are already using Roxio products to burn and archive, then I'd definately use this. However, there are many free programs/shareware that do the same things this does. Albeit, in a less organized fasion and with a steeper learing curve."
Perfect fit! Brand new in new box completely perfect condition and on sale!!! Awesome! Highly reccomend! Super cute shoes.
"Smells amazing and does a good job of refreshing. Provides some moisturization, and freshens the skin up."
"Gave this to my brother as a gift, he loved the packaging"
"I guess this thing is designed to be used by someone with an RV, big van, or something with a lot of room in the front, cause this is just not working out in a car.  With the laptop sitting on the passenger seat you really have to look away from the road a bit too long to check the map.  I like to see the map, not just listen to the voice tell me the directions.  I suppose if you had a passenger they could hold the laptop on their lap the whole trip and help you navigate.  I think the GPS/laptop combo is just too cumbersome to use if you are taking a trip in a car.  Buy the Streets & Trips without the GPS, or buy a dedicated GPS unit."
"I am a complete newcomer to CAD and home design software, but I have always had the idea in my head that if I could draw my house on my computer, then I could see what interior design and exterior landscaping changes would look like prior to actually doing them.  So I was excited to have a chance to review Chief Architect Home Designer Architectural 10 via Amazon Vine.

Make no mistake; this is serious home interior and exterior design (CAD) software, with loads of professional tools and features, and packed with thousands of items and choices to build your current home inside your computer, add a deck, or landscaping, or design your future dream home from the ground up.  But it's also incredibly fun, addictive, and (most of all) easy to use.  Even for someone like me, with no prior experience in home design software.

Before I started, I spent an hour or so watching the online tutorials to learn the basics. Next, I headed to my county's property appraisal website, found my lot in the city records, and printed out my exterior dimensions.  I opened a new floor plan, and quickly transferred those exterior dimensions to it.  Architectural 10 asks you to draw exterior walls in a clockwise direction, so it can add the siding on the outside.  You can adjust the thickness of these walls, and all the materials used.

Next came the fun (?) part; measuring all the rooms of my house and adding them to the floor plan.  After a few hours, I had a perfect 'dollhouse' model of my house (although I am still working on the tutorial about roofs!).  I added paint and flooring to match, and then the first room I started to decorate in was my kitchen.  I added cabinets, sink, fridge, dishwasher etc, all custom-altered to match my kitchen right down to the pulls on the drawers.  The program allows you to take any element and customize it however you like; not just furniture, but walls, roofs, wood framing, doors, windows--everything!  The result was a virtual replica of my kitchen, ready for resigning to my dream kitchen.

As you build up a floor plan in Architectural 10, you have numerous ways to view it.  Dollhouse is just that (like you've lifted off the roof and can see down into your rooms); Glasshouse (see-through walls), Frame (just the timber framing) etc etc.  If you want to look at something specific, you can place a camera in a static position, and pan round a room or hall or outside deck.  In addition, you can record a walk-through from a first person point of view, and share that with others.  My computer is three years old (although running Windows 7 Pro 64-bit and with a fairly recent graphics card), and I found all the views drew in incredibly fast, almost instantly.  I will list my computer specs at the end of this review.  The software runs great on my computer; I am also uploading a scan of the box back cover to show the recommended system specs.

Some cool features of Architectural 10 include the materials list.  You can budget for any house plan this way, adding the cost of items used in your design (flooring, windows, door handles etc), and then the program will generate a cost list based on the number of that item you use in your plan.  You'll know (practically down to the last nail) how much that dream house, or deck, or addition, will cost to build before you even start it.

Another cool feature is the ability to import a photo of your street to use as a background image.  If you just want to do some exterior landscaping, there's also an option of importing a photo of your house (front, back, side, etc) for use as the background, and then use the flower and tree menus to build your idea lawn and garden.  For the horticulturist, Architectural 10 even has a feature where you can age plants, so you can see exactly how tall that tree or shrub will be in ten years!

At this price point, Chief Architect Home Designer Architectural 10 might scare away beginners and/or casual users, which is a pity because it really has a lot of professional tools and features wrapped up into an accessible package where experience is not necessarily needed to start designing and planning your next home or addition.

About the only negative thing I can think of to say about  Chief Architect Home Designer Architectural 10 is that during installation process, it asks you to fill out your particulars, then PRINT AND MAIL a registration form!  Who does that in this day and age?  Couldn't it be via email at least?  Also, all the Library content (items, paint colors, floor coverings, plants etc etc) must be downloaded before you can use them, but you can do this all in one go, or as you want to use something (provided you are connected to the internet).

In closing, I will say that if you've ever wanted to try doing something like this and are okay with the price, then consider this software a great investment of your time and imagination . . . and then get out your tape measure!

"TurboTax is easy to use. Get your taxes done easily on your own.

Now that's out of the way. Features are removed. Price has gone up. Privacy issues.

Proceed at your own caution."
"The software installed OK on a Win 8.1 64 bit system.  It performed OK for a product in its price range.  For people interested only in very basic video production this product is fine.  I consider the learning curve to be slightly steep for a product of this type.  From past experience with Pinnacle I have found they are usually pretty good about releasing software updates to fix any significant problems found.

Recommended for the basic user. People interested in advanced editing would be better off with a more advanced and expensive package like Vegas Pro."
"For 7 years running, I have been a loyal Norton customer. I used my multiple device subscription to activate my license here in the US and for my father who resides in Asia. This year, it only activated my device here and not that of my father because the license is no longer valid in another region.

There are numerous good security packages in the market and I have stuck with Norton all along, despite it being more expensive than the competition. But the regional restriction is the last straw. I will now switch to another security package that doesn't have the hassle of such regional restrictions. Norton, you have just lost a 7-year old customer.

Separate from the regional issue, I had one month remaining on my Norton subscription in the US and instead of adding/stacking to my existing subscription time, Norton reset the clock so there is only a total of 12 months (rather than 13 months (1 +12)). Tw0 strikes, and unfortunately you are now out Norton!"
"I bought this for my husband. Hed been having issues with dandruff, but most dandruff shampoos cause skin issues. He loves it. Its just great for his hair and skin aside from helping with the dandruff. It smells good, too. Great product. I highly recommend it and would buy it again if it were still available on the site!"
"The Urban Spa Microfiber Bath Pillow makes soaking in the tub extra nice and so much more comfortable for my head and neck. Just fill it with air and attach it to the inside of your tub where you plan to rest your head. The microfiber is nicer than the all plastic bath pillows I've used in the past plus it look a lot nicer too. It's great if you're like me and love to just soak in the tub while reading a book or while just relaxing and listening to music (with the radio or stereo a safe distance from the tub of course!).

What a great way to pamper yourself without spending boutique prices to do it!"
"Martha's, always great!"
What's to say it's a gift
Only tax software I buy..easy to use ...no problems..have been using for nearly 10 years.
"I love Pre de Provence soaps, but was intensely curious about the Sea Salt bar.  What would it smell like?  Why would I want to wash my hands with sea salt?  Happily, this PRE DE PROVENCE SEA SALT FRENCH SOAP BAR (150g, 5.2 Ounce) is no different from the other Pre de Provence soaps--it smells wonderful, and produces a rich, thick lather.

The fragrance is hard to describe.  Its kind of floral, but maybe is best described as fresh sea breeze.  It makes one think of fresh air and sunshine.  The fragrance doesn't linger overlong.  The soap doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, but may be a little more drying than other Pre de Provence soaps (unless it's my imagination working overtime).

The soap definitely contains salt. The ingredients are:  sodium palmate, sodium palm kernelate, water, fragrance, palm acid, titanium dioxide, glycerin, palm kernel acid, SODIUM CHLORIDE, shea butter, sodium hydroxide, tetrasodium edta, tetrasodium etidronate, benzyl salicylate, linalool, geraniol, citral."
"I've been using this for the last 2 weeks and am really enjoying it.  It really gives you an amazing value and loads of the newest features and abilities.  If you don't want to spend over $350 for Sony Vegas Pro or over $700 for Adobe Premier Pro, then this Corel VideoStudio Pro is one of your best choices.  It has more features that any other sub-$100 video software program out there.

Compared to Adobe Premiere Elements 10 (Adobe's comparably priced video software), this software is just as easy to use but offers you many more options - like all the DSLR photo and videos features, the ability to work with huge video resolutions up to 4096 x 2160 pixels, ability to process the newest AVCHD 2.0 and AVCHD 3D video formats, Alpha Channels, slow-motion, and (most impressively) out of the box Blu-Ray video and disc rendering.  Adobe and Sony both require you to purchase another software program to render videos for Blu-ray discs.

To make this software even better, I haven't had it freeze up on my yet - which Premiere Elements would do too often for my liking - and the rendering process is faster.

Usually when companies release sub-$100 video software they give you dumbed-down versions of their pricier full-blown software... such as Adobe and Sony.  You lose features and get a product that leaves much to be desired.  Corel however has done it differently with VideoStudio Pro X6.  You can many of the great features that top level software has at the low level price.  I'm very pleased and plan on using this as my new video production software."
"I have used other Rosetta Stone programs and really like the teaching method they use. Each lesson introduces new words and phrases, which are repeated in different ways. The repetition makes it easy to retain the language lessons. The lessons progress in a logical way, so each builds on what has come before.

There were no technical problems for me in installing this program on my laptop running Windows XP. Installation takes a long time (it's a big program), but it worked perfectly. The headset is somewhat flimsy, but it works. Do turn the volume down VERY low before you start the program, or the sound will blast you out of your chair.

Rosetta Stone allows a lot of customization. For example, you can choose to learn reading and writing, speaking and listening, or reading, writing, speaking and listening. You can also choose how precise you want the voice recognition to be, so you can make it easier or more difficult.

The Audio Companion CDs do not seem very useful to me. They do not contain English translations, so their only purpose would be to listen to the pronunciation as a review.

The Rosetta Stone program is one of the best ways I have found to learn a new language. I had considered the intensive language program offered by a local college, but spending an entire week in a classroom would be hard to work in to my schedule. The Rosetta Stone lessons can be done on my schedule, at my convenience. Of course, you do need to work the lessons regularly so that you retain what you learned in the previous lessons and just because of the volume of information presented.

If you have tried other language programs without success, Rosetta Stone could work for you. Although the course includes listening and repeating, it is more interactive and interesting that those old language courses on cassettes or vinyl albums."
All of the different colognes and the price.
"Since Microsoft and its Office suite can be lightning rods in the Mac community, I put Office 2008 through its paces and took notes for a full year before writing this review. My notes below are brief because my goal was to list the attributes that persuaded me to keep this software rather than reverting to Office 2004. Indeed, I kept Office 2004 on my computer for five months after I installed this suite, so I could do side-by-side comparisons and decide which version to keep.

THE GOOD:
* PowerPoint functionality is more robust.
* PowerPoint themes make it simple to assemble an attractive basic presentation on the fly. While documentation and help are sketchy, applying brute force logic (and some experience with Photoshop and Quark) enabled me to make PowerPoint do some visual processes I thought that it ""should"" be able to do.
* Word loads faster and is more intuitive. It also has more modular components.
* PDF creation in Word is a simple ""save-as"" menu selection, which saves time compared with the print>save as PDF workaround.
* Anecdotally, Excel and Word are much better-behaved than the previous versions, with no and few hangs, respectively. I am a light user of Excel but use Word daily; the almost-daily aggravation is a thing of the past.

THE CAUTIONS:
* As with other Microsoft products, this suite does chew through a lot of resources. However, after trying out its svelter competition, I come back to Office for my personal use because of the convenience of using what most other folks use.
* Despite multiple attempts and multiple unanswered electronic queries to Microsoft, I have not been able to complete the online registration/tagging that is the last step of the install. (All seems well without it, but this situation leaves me a bit uneasy.)
* The install process is time-consuming. Allow at least two hours to install the software and then download and install multiple patches, even with lots of free space available on your hard drive. Contrast this with the approximately one hour it took to move from Leopard to Snow Leopard and perform further updates. For context, I used to do clean installs of OSes on our work Macs every two months back in the bad old days.

THE VERDICT:
I deleted my Office 2004 suite after five months of side-by-side use and, except for one minor irritant with header selection in Word, have not looked back."
"There is more to dislike than to like about 0ffice 2010.  I started using the free Open Office and find it an easier transition than using office 2010 and Open Office runs on other operating systems. Microsoft has moved so many features that your muscle memory developed over years of using previous versions of office is now useless. It takes me twice as long to do anything because of searching for features that I know exist and used to know how to find. How would you like it if Toyota moved the brake pedal to the back seat, well that is what Microsoft did. You can't find the pedals. I have been using it for about a year and still search for basic features that I have used for years. I am constantly clicking Help but the new Help for office consists of cheesy training videos that require Silverlight (which causes other problems) and Pollyanna blog posts. So then I go out to the web and find the answer from another grumpy user. I finally decided that if I was going to learn a new version of office it would be free so I downloaded Open Office and haven't looked back."
"I'm a writer. Like most people, I find I can talk a lot faster than I type (and with fewer errors. I've been using Dragon NaturallySpeaking for years, through several different versions, and I can understand the frustration some people feel when it comes to this software. Yes, it has made my computer crash on occasion. Yes, I've run into all sorts of other problems with it. Yes, it was very annoying when I was relying on it to help me get through National Novel Writing Month (or NaNoWriMo for short, a month when, like thousands of others, I attempted to complete a 50,000-word novel in just 30 days), and it inexplicably stopped working into the second week. Yet I keep going back to Dragon, and I keep paying for upgrades. Why? Because this is the best voice-recognition software on the planet.

I am dictating this review using Dragon NaturallySpeaking 11.5 Premium. This is not the software that I'm reviewing, which is the Home Edition. I am also not using the headset that came with the software, but I am using another cheap headset. Two things that I've learned from my years of using Dragon NaturallySpeaking: although the premium version costs significantly more, it is definitely worth paying extra for; and you might as well throw out the headset that the program comes with, because you get much better results with headsets that cost about $30-$50.

The main advantage I found with the premium edition is that it can read text to you. This is invaluable to a writer in the editing stage, because sometimes I will hear things when the program reads something back to me that I missed when I read it myself. For example, it's very easy to miss repeated words or phrases when you read, but they do stand out when you hear them. I don't know if the premium edition is also less buggy. It seems that way to me, but I can't be sure.

I've heard people say they been frustrated with Dragon NaturallySpeaking's customer service. This surprises me, because I've never had a problem with it. In fact, I've always found the people they employ to be well spoken, courteous and helpful. Perhaps I've just been lucky. I do find that Nuance calls a little too often in an effort to get me to buy Dragon NaturallySpeaking accessories and other products that they sell, but these conversations have also been quite courteous. Again, that has been my experience. Your experience may differ.

Whenever a writing friend of mine tells me that he or she is experiencing carpal tunnel syndrome, fibromyalgia, or something else that makes typing difficult, I recommend the latest premium edition of Dragon NaturallySpeaking. As far as I know, so far they've all been very happy with the software too.

This isn't to say the software is trouble-free and that you won't experience any problems. I think it's reasonable to assume that the program will occasionally stop working or possibly cause your computer to freeze up. When this happens, simply reboot. Remember to save your work along the way, so you don't lose much if you have to reboot. Hopefully like me, you'll find that Dragon Naturally Speaking is worth putting up with these frustrations.

Oh, and in case you were wondering, that month I completed my NaNoWriMo first draft in three weeks thanks to the huge chunk of the manuscript I was able to write before Dragon NaturallySpeaking conked out on me. I spent a year editing it, and the book is scheduled to be released this summer."
"Great product.  I have used it successfully for year.  However, I use it to make the first effort then take it to my tax gal of 27 years."
"Having been a loyal Windows customer and paying full retail price for Vista Ultimate the pricing for this product when compared to the other versions of Windows 7 is a slap in the face first of all so one star off just for that! Microsoft should've provided some discount for prior Vista Ultimate customers at least.
Charging an extra $200 or more for a couple of features that noone will use and some outdated ones like Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications is just plain tacky.
The only one that really adds any value is the new feature called ""VHD Boot"". With that you can boot your entire Windows out of a Virtual Hard Disk file as those used with Virtual PC or Virtual Server which can come in handy if you are a developer or like to install alot of beta products or games and want to make sure you don't screw up your main install.
Anyways, having upgraded my overpriced install of Vista Ultimate 64 bits the first thing you notice is that Microsoft actually downgrades you by removing the few Ultimate extras they did provide with Vista!
That's right Windows7 doesn't merely tell you it won't deliver another DreamScene content pack but that it's going to take away the ones you already had including Tinker, come on, Microsoft, that's just mean. After removing your Vista extras the upgrade form Vista goes smooth for the most part. I just had to reinstall drivers for my netgear wireless usb which Win7 couldn't find or provide. XP users are totally out of luck though since they will have to do a clean install and reinstall all their programs.
Other than the fact that Windows 7 forcibly removes your extras if you are already running Vista I wouldn't be in a rush to go out and grab a copy, especially not at the current price, since the improvements are little and subtle coming from Vista. If you are still running XP on the otherhand though you should've definitely upgrade asap.
I've used the bitlocker feature on a 2TB drive and it works as advertised and that's one area where the improvement compared to Vista are noticeable. For one you know longer have to create your own partition to install bitlocker since windows 7 takes care of it for you but it still takes forever to encrypt a 2TB drive, roughly several hours, but at least it's a one time deal unless you need to decrypt it to clone it or update your bios for example.
If you are trying to scrimp on hardrive space or memory Win7 does use a bit less than Vista but still more than XP, since Movie maker, mail, and several other programs that always used to come with Windows have been removed and are now a optional download. That won't make the few people that use or depend on those programs happy but for the rest I'm sure they are happier for a slimmer Windows. The other changes people upgrading from Vista will notice is the annoying sidebar is gone and the taskbar is huge and works way different than Vista so it takes some learning to figure out where Microsoft moved everything to. It took me a while to figure out where all my stuff went since Win7 tries to be helpful and hide more stuff from you like Macos x. For example your taskbar notifications are still there but hidden by default. Nothing else really impressed me since almost all the stuff in Win7 was already there in Vista. Problem Step Recorder is a nice addition for those that help others troubleshoot their computers or is a quick and dirty way to make your own tutorials. And contrary to what others are seeing Win7 is not noticeably faster than Vista for most stuff except maybe networking and hibernation does seem to work better now. Then again since it never seemed to work before now that it does work is certainly an improvement. Windows 7 is also alot more helpful in trying to troubleshoot incompatible applications and games since a little wizard pops up trying to help you but if your program/game didn't work in Vista it most likely isn't going to work in Win7 either. Oh and another thing I turned off right away was Aero snap since it kept trying to be helpful by rearranging my windows for me which I hated. Alot of others seem to love this feature though. Other little things that Microsoft finally got around to adding to Windows is native burn support for ISO so you don't have to install Nero, usually one of the first pieces of software I install, and Blu-ray burn only support. This still doesn't make up for the lack of virtual desktops support, which Linux and Mac OS X have provided for the longest time and is one of the most useful features ever devised. This is one of the biggest oversight Microsoft continues to make which each new release. Maybe if they threw in native Blu-ray playback support for the Ultimate edition it would make sense to charge more.
So that's my take from someone that used Vista since the day it was released and has been using Win7 since it was released roughly a month ago.
Oh and finally I'm not too happy that even this latest more secure version of Windows can easily be rendered non-functional just by installing an old game. Any old game that using StarForce will install a driver that will immediately cause a blue screen of death upon reboot. For example&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Namco-Museum-50th-Anniversary-Collection/dp/B000AAQZPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Namco Museum 50th Anniversary Collection</a>. Microsoft should really put a hardblock on this since I was only able to recover my system due to my technical skills. So much for compatibility with older games."
This gift card is useful
"Willmaker has been around for decades, getting better and more convenient each year...unless you have a Mac but that's a separate issue.  I run this under Parallels and it is just fine.

Follow the interview questions and you'll end up with a valid will.  Complex guardianship issues and conditional bequests are excluded, but if you have those issues you need a real live lawyer and individual attention.  A number of other useful forms are included, such as various powers of attorney, simple trusts, letter to survivors, and so on.  Useful to have them all in one spot, though you can download most of them from other sources.  If your time is worth nothing, go ahead and hunt for them.  Otherwise be glad they're here.  There's even a property inventory to help you remember what you have to leave.  And some standard estate planning advice.

Why 4 stars?  Becase in a typically cynical ahd self-serving attempt to turn software into a subscription, Nolo only lets you use this thing unmolested until 2014 is over.  At that point they start trying to scare you into buying an updated copy.  Don't listen, as the year to year changes in estate law are usually negligible.

Would I spend my own money on this?  Gladly.  No better software for the purpose."
"First, I must say there is a newer version of this software, for just a few dollars more, that has a LOT of new features:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-PaintShop-Pro-X4-Ultimate/dp/B005HTIWIQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel PaintShop Pro X4 Ultimate</a>.

Additionally, I read online that an X5 is soon to be released (early 2012), making this outdated by 2 editions.

That said, if you're really needing to save a few bucks over buying the newer versions, I think X3 is still valid, and a bang for a buck.

I say I'm coming from a ""novice"" perspective, but in actuality I use photo programs almost every day. It's just that my experience is primarily in web images, so my goal is usually making very small res pics, and making them look good online. So I often use free online editing programs like Pixlr, and on my older desktop I still use an old, old, old version of Paintshop Pro, version 10 I think (I can already hear the advanced users groaning!).

So I have almost zero experience making hi-res photos, professional layout, etc. But if you're an amateur or a user looking for simple photo editing (family photos), & jazzing up images for a web site, this program is a breeze and has more tools than you'll ever need."
Kept crashing. But there are no good alternatives there.
"The Good:

* Set it and forget it
* Traditional firewall and scanners you expect from a suite and then some
* Innovative features like anti-theft protection, keystroke encryption and wi-fi detector on your browser(tested on IE and Mozilla)
* Provides Mobile security for many PDAs as well

The Bad:

* Anti-Theft protection could've been extended to do much more

The Bottom Line:

A great product from Trend Micro.  Once you install it, you forget that its even there.  It doesn't bug you for every little thing like other suites tend to do.  It provides a powerful protection silently in the background.  Of course you may choose to do scans manually.  It has firewall, virus scan and a tune-up scan.  This is also a great suite for laptops as its easy on the resources and provides Wi-Fi security on the browser's toolbar.  It will let you know if the Wi-Fi you are using secure or not, in addition to whether or not the website you are on safe or not.  The anti-theft lock feature is a mixed bag but is still a good addition to the suite.  In a nutshell, you set up a master password(which if you ever forget, they will email it to you.)  You have the option to lock a folder where supposedly you keep all the private data in.  If your PC/Laptop gets stolen, nobody will be able to access that folder.  All you need to do is go to Trend's website and report your computer stolen.  Once your lost computer goes online, that folder will always remain locked, even if they know the password to the vault file.  My only gripe is:  If its possible to lock one file, why not have the ability to lock the entire computer while you're at it?  However, that minor ding will not stop me from recommending this product to others as I hope I never get to use the benefits of anti-theft features."
Conde Nast editors at Teen Vogue just publsihed an article promoting Anal Sex to Teens... Do you want to support a company that's promoting this stuff?
I have been a great fan of this magazine for over three years. It has wonderful storys and fashion tips.
"I subscribe to Good Housekeeping because the magazine is full of consumer advice and tips, that alone has saved me well over the cost of the magazine.

Good Housekeeping is a trusted name that tests and reviews products making their own suggestions, giving them the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval.

I have received so many good savings websites and tips that I keep subscribing just to save money."
"I got Norton 360 on a Gold Box special.  I haven't used anything from Symantec in a few years as the last anti-virus program from them caused some serious issues with my computer. I'm afraid this just confirms that Symantec is not to be trusted; ever.

Pros
Installing 360 on my Windows 7 desktop went fairly smoothly; it did force a reboot without warning, but I didn't loose any data.  It offered to add Identity Safe to my browsers and so far, I don't think that has done anything negative.

Cons
360 antivirus hangs more often than not.  When I try to invoke a manual scan on a file or folder, the window starts to open then stops.  I've given it 15 minutes and it doesn't continue.  360 didn't catch a Trojan in a file that I was suspicious of making it less than 100% effective. And now the worst part; 360 instantly deletes any file it doesn't like including system files!  I bought a new Toshiba drive and on plugging it in, 360 deleted the autostart file without warning. Now the backup software that came with the drive won't work.  It's deleted other perfectly innocent files that I've scanned with Microsoft, McAfee and AVG too. It especially doesn't like portable programs.

So to summarize; 360 deletes uninfected files and may still leave you vulnerable to attach.  That makes it worth less than $0 to me."
"I love this soap! It has Shea butter and is triple milled. The scent is just right. Not over powering.
I will buy again!"
Not really great but not sure there is a better one.
"I've been a QuickBooks user for many years. For me (someone who understands the ideas of accounting, P&L, gross vs. net etc., but does NOT have professional bookkeeping experience), the simplicity of QuickBooks, its easier transaction editing and reporting, and its use of (mostly) real-world terminology was what I wanted in an accounting package. The more professional packages were just a bit too confusing for non-accountant me.

However, times have changed. It's no surprise that if you are more comfortable with traditional bookkeeping techniques, or require a more robust feature set, Sage 50 (which used to be Peachtree) may be the way to go; what is a surprise is that Sage 50 is now accessible enough to an average business person that I'm comfortable with it.

The terminology and setup in Sage 50 are more traditional (from a professional bookkeepers perspective) than QB's, which means when my accountant asks for something specific I can deliver it without translating his request into QuickBooks terminology.

And the feature set on the Premium edition of Sage 50 is excellent. Inventory support includes Average, FIFO, LIFO unit-specific costing. You're also allowed up to 10 pricing levels per item, which is HUGELY useful to me as I manufacture and sell at both retail and wholesale levels to multiple customers with varying discounts.

Reporting is excellent, and there's more customization available in the dashboard as well as in reports. Invoices, order, and other forms are also customizable.

After some time with Sage 50 I've found I like it better than QuickBooks. I prefer the interface, I like the customizable dashboard, I prefer the inventory options, and love the multi-level pricing. I'm also a bit burned out on QuickBooks' business policies: too much advertising within the program, features that I think should be there that need to be purchased (or don't exist), buggy operation at times and poor (in my experience) technical support (on that last topic, I have NOT called Sage for tech support but HAVE heard good things about them).

A few years ago, the useability gap between QuickBooks and the more ""professional"" accounting programs was quite large: large enough that I always worked with QuickBooks. With this version of Sage 50 though, that gap has closed enough that I've found it may be worth the time it takes to relearn a few things to be able to use what feels to me like a more robust, more professional solution.

Sage 50 Premium 2014 is an excellent product with everything I need (and plenty I don't)."
"There's not a whole lot more to say about this Norton product. I've been using Norton for year. Even back in the day when you could buy one license software version and without having to pay for a new version each year, you could just download updates. Long gone are those days. The stickler part of this is that we need protection for our electronic devices. I will say, that last year I paid $80 for this software from the Norton website, but I purchased this download from Amazon for only half that price. Keep that in mind when it comes to renewing your virus software."
"I bought this software along with the McAfee Total Protection 2012 as it was recommended on website.  It did not work with the Total Protection software, so I wound up returning software & getting a credit for same."
"Right around the turn of the century it became very fashionable to mine the nostalgia of the latest crop of people who are now adults with paying jobs - Gen X, basically. The truth is that many of the pop culture artifacts that have seeped into our consciousness earned their place not by being very good but by being very repetitive. There are many, many shows I watched not because I was interested in them but because you couldn't swing a television remote without catching Happy Days, The Brady Bunch, The Love Boat, Fantasy Island, etc. If you were a kid on a Saturday morning, this meant you couldn't avoid Land of the Lost.

Land of the Lost was never very good, but it didn't matter to me: It was the only way I was going to see monsters on television. Back then, any monster special effects were relegated to the big screen, and since I wasn't allowed to see most movies that featured them Land of the Lost was the only way I was going to see dinosaurs - even if they were poorly animated puppets or claymation. So you better believe I watched every bizarre episode I could, even if it never made any sense, the acting was frequently terrible, and the sets, costumes, and actors looked like they were made of rubber.

Producers who decide to update these nostalgia icons have a choice: revamp the terrible show with utter seriousness (think ""Lost in Space"") or shamelessly mock it instead. ""Land of the Lost"" chooses to mock its source material.

The problem is that it's not a loving mockery made by fans. It's clear the producers didn't do their homework. Oh they got some things right - they mimic the look-and-feel of the Sleestaks, of Cha-Ka, and Grumpy the dinosaur (sans claymation). But the innocent wonder is replaced with a smarmy, cynical approach that makes Will Ferrell out to be kind of a jerk.

The three main characters are paleontologist Rick Marshall (Ferrell), student Holly Cantrell (Anna Friel, sporting a variety of tight t-shirts), and randomly inserted gift shop owner and foil to Marshall, Will Stanton (Danny McBride). They fall through a wormhole, they have to get back, Sleestaks, dinosaurs, yadda-yadda, the end. Marshall's rivalry with Matt Lauer (as himself) over the existence of time warps is the funniest thing about the film.

Ferrell, who pretty much plays the same character in whatever movie he's in, doesn't have a warm cast to temper his antics. Instead he goes through a series of contrived set-ups with a punch line that ends in dinosaur excrement. This joke is used no less than three times. Scriptwriter Chris Henchy needs to find some new material.

And that's the thing. If you're not familiar with the original TV series, this is just another semi-amusing entry in Ferrell's oeuvre with dinosaurs thrown in. But the whole point of reimagining the series was to lure those fans back into the theater, and instead they ended up with a bunch of dino poop."
"I've read REDBOOK since the early 1970s, and am disappointed by the content the magazine has published for the last decade or so.  REDBOOK used to feature housekeeping, literary excerpts, beauty and style.....now it's become another ho-hum mummy mag for a housewife generation that barely exists anymore.  They have the occasional celebrity, but you can get better information on Hollywood from PEOPLE or US WEEKLY.  This is for soccer moms, with little to offer anyone else.

Sad to see a great magazine lose so much of its quality and appeal."
"HELP, PLEASE!!! AMAZON PRODUCT REVIEWS ARE VERY HELPFUL TO ME, ESPECIALLY WITH PROBLEMATIC PRODUCTS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ME OR MY PCs.****SEE QUESTIONS AT BOTTOM.**** I have given NIS a middle or neutral rating because NIS 2007 was so bad, but NIS 2008 appears to be much better.  I just do not know enough about NIS 2008.

I purchased Norton Internet Sececurity 2007 shortly after it was released in August or September 2006.  I installed it on 3 of our computers with Windows XP (Professional and Home) operating systems. Although I had had great experience for more than 10 years with Norton products, NIS 2007 was so bad that I vowed never to use or buy any Symantic product.  NIS 2007's initial loading required that I delete my spyware  software protection programs in order to install NIS 2007 (to sell Norton???), it slowed all 3 PCs to a snail's pace, it had unneccessary functions, I could not delete or turn-off those functions without a waring, ad nauseum.

HOWEVER, I downloaded Trialware of NIS 2008 on a laptop with VISTA.  NIS 2008 was less disruptive to install and it works so well that I am considering istalling it on our other PCs, but I would like some more input from users of NIS 2008.
  1.  WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH NIS 2008 ON PCs WITH WINDOWS XP?
  2.  ON XP, DOES NIS 2008 WORK BETTER THAN NIS 2007?
  3.  WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH NIS 2008 ON PCs WITH WINDOWS VISTA?
  4.  ON VISTA, DOES NIS 2008 WORK BETTER THAN NIS 2007?"
"was boring, nothing much to the magazine, very few pages and no news about celebrities that I hadn't heard before."
"I've used Partition Magic since version 3.0. Partition Magic 7.0 is now WinXP compatable and supports hard drives up to 80 GB. This software is a phenominal program that allows hard drive repartitioning ""on-the-fly"" and easy booting into different operating systems. I have a PC-DOS/Win3.1 partition and a Win98SE partition on the same hard drive and a WixXP partition (preview version) on a second hard drive. I have also had a Linux partition on the first drive. You can resize partitions and convert from fat 16 to fat32 and back. You can also divide one large hard drive into several drives to help organize data and files. Boot Magic (and the previous Boot Manager) are great to allow easy booting into any OS that you have on your drive. Partition Magic has never given my a problem. I have never lost data. The manual is clear, well written and easy to follow. If you want to have more than one OS on your computer or to try out a new OS or upgrade (like WinXP), then this program is a must have. Highly recommended."
Great shampoo for my 2 year old he has mixed hair
"I have found this product more then usually hard to use. The description of the product sounds much better that what you get. I can't say I have accomplished much with this program, but it was not for lack of trying. A rather frustrating program that requires a lot of time to get working and then to figure out. There must be something easier to use out there that does the same basic thing."
Great anti-frizz product!
"Trend Micro are also touting Windows 7 optimization and that the software is ""state aware"". What that means is you won't be seeing any resource sapping updates or scans being carried out if you already happen to be doing something resource intensive like watching a video, or working in Photoshop. Instead Internet Security 2010 will wait for a period of time where the system is idle or running something won't affect the user experience. An emphasis has also been put on keeping things simple for the user while still providing them with all the information they need. So this update will see the use of more graphs and charts to represent information such as the Security Activity Dashboard which shows users exactly what security activity has been happening recently on their machine.

Installation
Easy Breazy..The Trend Micro installation process is about as smooth and pain-free as you could hope a program that will have such deep hooks into your system could be. It will detect other antivirus programs and then ask for approval to remove those installed on your machine, but it doesn't require a reboot after it's done -- something most competitors do.  If you know anything about computers ALWAYS REBOOT!

Interface and features
Looks good...Trend Micro's 2010 interface has been further refined from the previous year's version, with less dead space and more emphasis on your security status and the ease of access to security tools. The program launches into its Overview tab, which highlights your security status with a large, coloured icon: green for Protected and Red for Unprotected. Below that, there are links to your protection status, your licence information, and a security report. Each of these links drills down to essential information, exposing data in an elegant and uncluttered manner on the main page. The Protection Status link opens a window that details the status of your virus definition files, updates, firewall, unauthorised change prevention, spam filter, parental controls, and data-theft prevention. Each of these has a green On or red Off status icon, with a hidden explanation of each that can be exposed by clicking on it. Unfortunately, there's no way to get from the list to the actual deeper controls for each, but it's simple for toggling the status. Trend uses technology that allows the publisher to leverage supposedly-anonymous data from customers to catch surreptitiously-running threats faster isn't new; it's been around for a few years, although this year is seeing more security suites adopt it. On the other hand, companies like Trend Micro must consider whether users will panic if it is mentioned clearly and then disable their computers from contributing data to the cloud.

Performance
Although there were no problems navigating within Trend Micro and there were no noticeable slowdowns to the naked eye, certain Trend Micro performance hang-ups did appear. For one, the suite had a difficult time respecting the default browser setting on a Windows 7 laptop. Sometimes it would open internal program links into Firefox (the programmed default), but more often it would open them into Internet Explorer. These links -- opening into either browser -- took much too long to load. It wasn't clear whether this lag was because of the main suite or the Trend Micro toolbar scanning them before launching.

Trend Micro's full scan was but slow, compared to other software packages I've used. The non-benchmarked, quick scan compared favorably with industry standards, coming in under a minute.  Trend Micro's results were also uneven on processor-intensive tests. Unfortunately, Trend Micro's efficacy is up for debate. The company no longer participates in the trials run by [...], and the most recent data from [...] is for the 2008 version. Keeping in mind that the data is for a test from September 2008 (though the 2008 release is actually from fall 2007 because of the security industry's naming conventions), Trend Micro had lukewarm results. It was able to detect between 90 and 95 per cent of malware on demand, between 85 and 90 per cent of adware and spyware on demand, and only notched one to two false positives.

Support
Trend Micro offers free customer support, although if you're looking for help through the program, it will merely shove you via hot-linked FAQs toward the Trend Micro website. The Product Help link will keep you on your computer, but the rest jump you online. Once there, Trend Micro offers pre-recorded video help, manuals, online-chat service, and phone service. The phone number is listed on the website behind several links, and is not particularly easy to find.

Conclusion
Trend Micro looks and feels like a professional security suite, but it's worrisome that the company doesn't participate in the major tests that its competitors are subject to. Online backup and PC tune up features are nice to have, but it's really the performance of the software while you are trying to use your machine that really counts. You want something that runs without ever being noticed in terms of system performance, but at the same time is quick to step in if something happens; like you follow a malicious link or download a virus. A number of the vendors are managing to achieve that, but improvements can always be made.
I like the state aware feature Trend Micro has introduced. Even if it reaches the scheduled time to do a scan or update it will check before doing it just to make sure you aren't doing something intensive. It may delay a scan for half an hour, but I'd rather that than it make the game I'm playing stutter or even crash.
Overall, Trend Micro gives you a lot for your money, but lacks speed & verification from independent testers.  At least you get a fre USB stick out of the deal...

"I have been running 2013 Plus for almost a year on 2 Windows 8 Pro 64bit computers. It has worked flawlessly. With several scheduled backups on each at different times and backup locations.
 I recieved an offer directly from Acronis to upgrade to 2014. I emailed them as to what improvments were made and they said Interface and cloud/Network backup. I thought I would give it a try.
 Glad I did. It is much faster than 2013. The GUI is a little cleaner.
 I have now got 3 Win 8 computers running Acronis Premium. 2014. They all have multiple backups to different locations. No problems at all.
 I recommend intergrating Acronis into the Windows boot. It gives an ""F11"" Boot option at bootup, so you can go into Acronis instead of booting. Restores and backups both work from a ""Linux"" enviroment. It works great. You can also make bootable media from Acronis to do the same thing on DVD or CD.
 Warning....This is a powerful product. Please read the Manual.
 The ""Clone feature"" is in my opinion, the best on the market. I have done several and they worked everytime.
 Also recommended is to set frequent ""Validation"" of all backups. Just  to make sure they will work.
 If you need a powerful Clone/Backup program this is a Highly recommended buy."
"As an owner of a small business, there are often times when I need a simple contract or legal document drafted up.  Time and resources are valuable.  Not everyone can afford to pay lawyers or legal aides $400+ to fill out some template.  This package gives you the convenience to do it yourself.

This library of forms and books is comprehensive and can save you a bundle.  After installing and using it for a few weeks here are the pros and cons that I have come up with:

PROS:
- Simple and straightforward installation
- Easy to use
- Extensive collection of forms
- While I haven't had the time to read it all, the Nolo business books is a great point of reference

CONS:
- fill-in process is required.  IMO it would be much easier to input the information directly into the document.
- no index of documents
- could not find any way to export information to other file formats.

Overall, this collection of forms and books presents a great value that can save you money on your first use, and I'd highly recommend it for other small business owners."
"I'm a Mac user, so I got this for the Windows I run using Parallels. I have to say that this is a fairly obtrusive product that makes its presence known several times throughout the internet browsing experience."
Worked out great.
Not much help in the items I bought it for. Don't bother purchasing this book.
How could money look bad in any denomination. The box is very nice n I am giving it as a gift
Using for quite some time for certain accounting and MS apps that won't run in Mac. Fast and reliable. Easy to use and runs well in background of OS with no loss of performance.
"With the recent improvements in the security settings in MS Internet Explorer 6.0, many of the features of this software (e.g., cookie blocking) have become redundant. The remaining major feature, ad blocking, is useful but not worth the price of the software.
Moreover, the software lacks several functions one would otherwise expect--pop-up blocking and the blocking and removal of spyware (hidden programs that, once downloaded onto your system, report back personal information to whoever installed them).
Of particular concern is the fact that this program pre-approves ads provided by certain information-gathering companies, without bothering to tell you. (Improves the bottom line, you know!) To find and remove these sites, you have have to go to ""Options--Internet Security--Advanced Options--Ad Blocking"" and remove them individually.
""But didn't I buy this software to eliminate that kind of problem?"", you ask. Exactly my point."
"I have bought two or three of these for myself and friends. They work really good, and seem to have better reception than other bluetooth adapters that I have used. If you buy this I don't think you will be disappointed!"
"Excellent Tax Preparation software. I have been using it for years and never had any major issues with it and never got audited. I think it is the best tax preparation software out there. Yes you can get cheaper software, but you get what you pay for."
"Norton is just okay. It tends to mess up other programs, and viruses and I'm afraid that trojans also get through. The one advantage of this version over others: its extra features. Also, this version covers several devices.

Still, not the best virus and internet protection. Just okay."
"I've used version 3 and now 4 only to find it's better and more refined over the years.  It can be quick and easy or you can take your time to explore the many settings.  You can go wild and really transform a photo into something psychedelic or you can use it to refine EXRs or HDRs to ""just right"".  It's all your call.  It's also a good way to put phased (exposure stepped) photos together into one photo to show brilliant shadows and succinct highlights - this is what first attracted me to this software years ago.

Have fun!"
"Pretty good magazine.  5 stars because it is a mens magazine that does not exploit women every month.  Now and then there is a pretty lady on the front or inside, moderation is good.  Again also just happy because there are so few (guy) and (actual print) magazines out there.  Magazines and newspapers are meant to be read in the physical form.  Complaint- the advertisemnts are for some extremely expensive products, that most americans cannot or will not buy.  Also when the magazine does some review the products most of the time the products are way to expensive for most middle class to poor americans."
Great magazine to get new recipes.
"This is my first experience with Painter, so I don't have the insight to compare with previous versions. With my Wacom tablet, I was able to do quite a lot qith the product out of the box, but I didn't always find the product completely intuitive, so beginners should expect to seek outside instruction. Do not try to use Painter without a tablet - you'll be sorely disappointed.

I am pretty amazed at how Painter simulates analog brushes and strokes of all different varieties, and clearly you can create some very painterly or illustrative effects.

I am looking forward to using Painter with Photoshop files - something I haven't tried yet, but there are instructions for. The ability to pull in and use layered Photoshop files, seems stellar to me. How many times have you wanted an artistic effect in Photoshop that was just plain difficult to accomplish?

This is a very serious tool for serious artists. I know a lot of art directors and storyboard people who work 100% in Painter. I have enjoyed my short time with Painter, and look forward to discovering more."
My 2nd year using this software  does the job well
"There are a number of PC utility packages out there. Symantec (Norton), Avanquest, System Mechanic, etc all make system utility programs that are supposed to help you remove old programs, de-clutter your hard drive, remove viruses and trojans, recover lost files, securely delete old files, etc.

I found Fix-It Utilities to be similar to what I have seen in the other packages.

Here's the trick though - DO NOT INSTALL any of these programs in the name of preventative maintenance. Sure - you need antivirus software, but there are simpler programs out there that offer antivirus protection without all of the other functionality (bloat) that comes in these complete utility packages.

This type of program is intended for computers that already have problems. For example, I installed this on an employee's computer that was experiencing repeated system crashes, was taking 10 minutes to boot up, took 10-15 minutes to shut down and ran just about every program at half the expected speed. In the case of this computer, Fix-It Utilities successfully removed a bunch of old programs, cleaned up the registry to remove mention of retired servers, and made a bunch of other changes. After that was done, I had it securely delete the unused portions of the drive. The end result is that this machine boots MUCH faster (under 3 minutes), hasn't had a crash since the clean up, and shuts down in less than 5 minutes.

After the maintenance was done, I uninstalled the Fit it Utilities software from the machine as it was no longer needed. I re-installed Symantec antivirus and was done. Uninstalling the software took some time, but no longer than uninstalling other utility packages.

By the way - I normally would have wiped the hard drive and re-installed the OS and apps from scratch with a machine that runs this poorly. In this case there was a particular program used to control a machine tool. The install disc was lost and the machine vendor is out of business so I could not go the reformat route.

To summarize - do not install this if your computer is working fine. If you have problems with crashes and slow speeds, this program may help you. Uninstall it after you are done with maintenance as it has the potential to slow your day-to-day computer activities down if left on 24/7."
"While I usually upgrade my Quicken every year, I felt this year I actually got something for my money. The budgeting and planning section seems dramatically improved and it can now sync with my iPhone with an app that keeps me informed of my balances. I really think this version bears looking at if you are a current user of Quicken, and if not - where have you been. It really helps you know where your money is and where it's going!"
Work perfectly with my hackintosh
Theres nothing like using a luxurious so like this in the shower or bath. It has a lovely scent and lathers up nicely. But the thing I like best about it is that its the French milled or hard miilled soap and it lasts a long time. I think of soaps like this as one of lifes little luxuries. I think they're worth the extra money since they last so much longer than grocery store soaps.
"I'm not sure if PaintShop will be adequate for professionals, but for my purposes I'm very happy with the software.

Installation was super easy and after using it for a few weeks, I have not noticed any effect - speed wise - on my computer.

Here are some of my favorite features:

- I can tag people and then use the search functions to find specific photos
- Great special effects like the Graduated Filter tool for adding interesting color options
- Built-in social media features that make it a snap to add descriptions and upload to site like Facebook
- Comprehensive library of video tutorials for those that want to learn more and go beyond the basic features

Of course, you also get the common touch-up functions like changing saturation, brightness, fixing red eye, etc. Once again, professionals who need a full suite of photo editing features may lean towards PhotoShop, but for my purposes - and budget, PaintShop meets and exceeds my needs."
It would lockup and could not get anything done. Try Power Director 13 instead. Power Director also has a 30 day trail that everything works.
"My husband uses an earlier version of this program along with the capture device from the same company, but every so often its bugs catch up with it. He has to uninstall and reinstall it. It works for a while then. Well, I thought this new version might have fixed the bugs, so I ordered it and gave it to him to try on his Windows 7. First, it was really hard to install it. It downloaded updates which took a while. That isn't uncommon, but then we got to the serial number. I say we, because it took both of us and trial and error to figure it out. We couldn't tell the difference between 0 and O. Finally we got it installed. He doesn't have any use for the Aftershot organizer. He uses the program for video capture. It didn't work well enough. The sound was garbled and it hesitated. Useless. He uninstalled it and reinstalled his old version. It worked much better. Okay, well, I have a new Windows 10 laptop, so I thought I'd give the program another chance. (I don't use capture, but I might use some other features of the program and I wanted to see if it worked better on the Windows 10 device. Unfortunately, I guess you only get one installation because it wouldn't accept the serial number. Don't bother with this. Look for an older version."
Good so far
"This is much better than other Microsoft Office for Mac software I've had in the past, but still has its own issues.

The Pros:
-Everything is very pretty and smooth, lookwise.  Icons fit in with current Mac icons.
-Documents transferred from older versions came into these programs well.  None of my documents I opened in this (that were previously viewed on my older programs) came in garbled.
-All programs are still very easy to use, even without a manuel.
-Many different saving options are available, so if you find yourself needing to send a document to a Windows user or a person with a less updated program, you can!

The Cons:
-The programs are slow to load.  It takes a good half a minute sometimes to open to file I want, however large or small.
-Occasionally, it will shut down for no reason.  Thankfully, it does that less often than my older version did.  Just a note, save your work frequently because the Mac versions of Microsoft do tend to quit unexpectedly every now and then.

I'm enjoying this version much better than my last (which I have reviewed, as well).  Even with its issues, I haven't seen anything better that is compatible with a Mac and PC users.  If you're looking for a basic programs for your new Mac, this is a good one."
"OK tax software, but between Turbo Tax and Tax Cut- as I have used both products- I personally prefer Turbo Tax."
"WARNING to anyone thinking about buying this product! Please understand that you will not be buying this product only RENTING it. If you do not renew every year the product stops working....COMPLETELY! I'm not just talking about updates, etc. It actually tells you that it has stopped working and it won't work unless you renew. I have just wasted more than 2 hours with Norton's online tech support. This is the case with ALL Norton products and I am quoting the tech."
"I have used Turbo Tax for the last four years and have had no problems. I do not like the fact that they charge an extra $19.99 to E-file your state tax form, they should be more up front and include it in the price. This year they offered 10% more on your tax return if you bought Amazon gift cards. I did this and it worked out great! It was like getting Turbo tax and all sales taxes on all my purchases from Amazon for free!"
love this magazine  !!!
Love these sneakers. Light weight and comfortable even without socks.
"TaxCut offers individuals a powerful option for preparing an income tax return that is relatively easy to use. TaxCut assumes that you know little or nothing about income tax law. The software will ask a number of questions and will prompt you for information based on your answers. It will help tremendously if you gather as many of your tax documents as possible before starting. This software is significantly cheaper than paying a service to prepare it and much easier than doing in manually.

The e-file option has been around for some years and is a great way to get your refunds faster. But if you owe money, there's not as much of an advantage.  Still, you get five free electronic filing so you might as well use one.  In the unlikely event that you plan to prepare more than five returns, make sure you use the e-file for the ones due a refund and file the ones with money due manually.  The program will print all the forms you need so it's easy to do and it will save you the cost of the fees for the additional e-files.

The one negative for this program is that the publisher used to offer free e-filing for the state return as well as federal but has dropped that for the 2008 edition.  With a charge weighing in a whopping $19.95 for e-filing each state return, this is not a trivial fee.  I would recommend filing state returns manually unless you will receive a refund large enough to make getting the check a week or so faster worth that extra money.

Please note that this version covers both Federal and State returns. Most people will need both, but if you live in a state with no income tax then you'll want to look at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/H-R-Block-TaxCut-2008-Premium-Federal-e-file/dp/B001HO6Q7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">H&R Block TaxCut 2008 Premium Federal + e-file</a>&nbsp;for considerably less money.

If you don't itemize your deductions and have a very simple return, you might be better off preparing the forms manually on your own. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you have a return with major league complications, you should probably go to a good CPA. For everyone else, this is really a no-brainer. It's inexpensive, easy to use, and accurate. I've been using TaxCut for quite a few years and would not even consider giving it up."
You cant go wrong with Coldstone.
"Serif PhotoPlus X4 is inevitably compared to Photoshop, and while I like Photoshop for its capabilities and the bells and whistles that can be applied AFTER you have the photo you want (like slideshows), I find Serif PhotoPlus quite useful at a significantly lower price.

PhotoPlus is easy and intuitive to use for many of the most common tasks such as cropping and red-eye correction.

As a photo amateur I must admit I'm just beginning to learn the more detailed and complicated features that use layers to add and subtract and correct only portions of the photo.  We've just acquired a Canon SLR which can take RAW images, and I find PhotoPlus one of the only programs that can handle that format.

So - I would consider having Serif PhotoPlus at the same price as Photoshop.  At $25 less I consider it a relative bargain.

Truth in advertising: I obtained both PhotoPlus and Photoshop as free samples as an Amazon Vine Voice Reviewer.  But with Photoshop also available, as I stated earlier, I still use PhotoPlus."
"Cute presentation of a birthday gift card.  My friend loved it.

Definitely recommend."
"I've used CorelDRAW for years - since CorelDraw 3 - so I was very excited to get the chance to use Corel VideoStudio Ultimate x7.

I'm a complete novice at video editing. Prior to getting VideoStudio, my video was whatever I recorded at the time. I had no idea how to edit out unintended stuff or add titles or add music, etc. Even though it has plenty of very sophisticated and complex editing options available to the user, this software makes it easy to get started.

In the box is two discs. That's it. The user's manual is included in the installation and there are loads of video tutorials you can access from inside program.

Installation was easy and straightforward. Note: the EULA states that you are licensed to have VideoStudio installed on only one computer at a time so if you have multiple computers in your home, choose wisely or you will have to uninstall from one computer in order to install it on another one.

The software places 3 icons on your desktop - VideoStudio, FastFlick and ScreenCap. If you are new to video editing, FastFlick is an amazing tool. Download your videos and pictures that you wish to edit to your computer and then FastFlick will let even a novice produce a surprisingly professional bit of video. Through the use of templates you can add titles, music, add additional video clips, apply effects like pan and zoom and lots of other things. Even if, like me, you've never edited video before, you can use FastFlick.

Corel also makes it easy for you to upload your finished videos to places like YouTube and Facebook, as well as burning your video to a DVD- all from within the software!

VideoStudio is a full-fledged video editing program that gives you a myriad of different ways to edit your raw video. If you've never used video editing software before, there will be a learning curve when it comes to VideoStudio. Don't expect to be able to edit a video immediately. Corel knows this, which is why they created and included FastFlick. It acts as kind of an intro to video editing and at the same time, give you immediate gratification by helping you produce a very attractively edited video right out of the box.

The user's guide, which you can find under the Help tab in VideoStudio, is refreshingly well written and easy to search. It's in .PDF format and you can download it to your computer. It's worth reading even if you aren't normally the type to read the manual. ;-)

For the current price of under $80, I think this software is a bargain! It's easy enough, thanks to FastFlick, that even a newbie can create a respectable video, but powerful enough that someone familiar with this kind of software will be very pleased. (I confirmed this with a friend, whose job it is to edit advertising video. He couldn't believe how powerful it was - even compared to the commercial editing software he uses at work.)

If you want or need to edit your videos to make them something special, Corel made this software for you!"
My hair feels really clean after using this shampoo & conditioner. I have hard water at home and I was using Neutrogena to remove the build-up and though it works well it also dried my hair out too much. This product does the same thing but leaves my hair feeling very clean & soft easy to manage. Very good product & would purchase again.
"I first started using Corel Draw back when I purchased a license of Corel Draw 2. The last full version that I bought and used was Corel Draw 8, not counting the home and student license of X5 I bought (but never really used) during one of Amazon's Gold Box Deal sales. I got away from using it at that point when I got assigned to teach a digital graphics & animation class where they were using Adobe's Photoshop 5 and Illustrator 10. I eventually bought myself a license of Adobe Creative Suite 4 Design Premium to use at home. And have since upgraded to their Creative Suite 5.5 - Design Premium. But now that Adobe has chosen to eliminate physical updates in favor for digital downloads (and maybe even going to an online application) I'm looking to go back to using Corel Draw. Nearly everything I need to do can be done with this new version of Photo-Paint and Corel Draw X7. You can even set the programs GUIs to mimic Photoshop's and Illustrator's.

The one thing that I have not liked about this new package - is that the content libraries are all on-line now. I found them to be a bit clunky to navigate and somewhat confusing as to what the three different badges were suppose to represent. I couldn't find any reference to one of the badges in any of the online documentation. Not really a big deal for me, as I hardly ever use the stock clip-art, and I still have all the stuff that came with my previous versions of the software.

The PDF manual that you can download is adequate for getting up to speed on the software - but I will be purchasing the CorelDRAW X7 The Official Guide (if and when it becomes available).

I like the new versions of the software, with maybe the exception of the Website Creator package. First off, it doesn't come on the installation disc - you have to download it off the internet. And it doesn't install with the software packages. But I think the main reason I didn't have a positive feeling about it, is when you open it you are presented a matrix of squares much like the new Windows 8 GUI. That really turned me off. Again, not that big a deal as I don't really do a lot of web page creating these days - and when I do, I like to code things by hand using plain HTML. Maybe later I can play with the Website Creator software and see if I can get past the look of the opening screen.

Over all I would say Corel's done an good job with this new release. I'd recommend it."
"Everyone doing drafting today is familiar with AutoCAD. It is so widely used that there are now several alternate use models for which AutoCAD itself is overkill. AutoCAD LT 2012 perfectly fits several of these, take a look:

Home/Laptop/Travel/Sales Office/Customer Meetings: I keep a copy of LT on my laptop for use at customer meetings and even the work site.  Cheaper than AutoCAD, with perfect compatibility. There's no better way to review and modify drawings in the field (except AutoCAD). I know of one contractor who keeps a laptop loaded with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AutoCAD-LT-2010/dp/B001UO8M8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AutoCAD LT 2010</a>&nbsp;on loan with his biggest customer. They can view anything, make changes, and in general work together better.

2D Drafting: AutoCAD LT 2012 is all you need. There is nothing a 2D draftsman needs that this package does not offer. Note however, none of AutoCAD's 3D capabilities are included.

As successful as this low-end product has become, it has one flaw: it retains the steep learning curve of its big brother. I am of two minds here. As a powerful stand-alone 2D package, AutoCAD LT 2012 has a depth of capability that few will use completely. That depth deserves some learning (or better yet, professional training). Makers of other high end packages have successfully built low-end tools that are easier to learn: Adobe Photoshop Elements comes to mind. But Elements provides only a small subset of the functionality of Photoshop, unlike AutoCAD LT 2012, which provides virtually the entire AutoCAD feature set (except 3D).

So if you need a 2D drafting package with flawless AutoCAD compatibility, AutoCAD LT 2012 is literally perfect. But if you don't use AutoCAD already, you will need training, or at the very least a good book!"
"These are products I use regularly and am always looking for a ""good deal"" -- I feel this was a very good deal!  Quick delivery and completely satisfied!"
"I migrated an XP machine to my quad core iMac. I should have power to spare, but startup can take 10 minutes and after that performance is often very slow.

Clearly something is wrong, but I can't figure this one out.

If you have version 2 and it's working, don't upgrade yet."
"After doing a clean installation, I found that was no longer there. I was unable to buy it at Apple. That's being there in a pinch."
Great piece of software that does everything I need on the computer. Thought I would post a review for this as I've finally upgraded to the newer version. Seamless operations and never crashes or has calculation error.
"I used the Dragon software with some reluctance, as I have been unhappy with Windows 7's speech recognition (and VERY happy with the voice recognition by, for instance, Google's mobile app and Vonage's Visual Voicemail).  Dragon's software has performed far better for me than Windows, and it really excels at recognizing foreign accents.

Pros:
-reasonably accurate
-works well with people with strong foreign accents (but they still must annunciate very clearly)

Cons:
-system resource hog especially on a 2gb netbook
-still not as good as systems that work over the internet (like Vonage Visual Voicemail)
-seems to be less reliable on numbers"
"I may be going out on a limb here, but Windows XP is the most important upgrade to the Windows operating system since Windows 95. In addition to a new look, it offers stability, ease of use and more Internet integration than ever before.
Installation was easy. You can either upgrade your existing Windows or do a clean install. I recommend a clean install so be sure to back up your important data (e-mail, accounting programs, etc.) You can boot from the CD and it will pretty much to the rest. Installation takes about 30-60 minutes but it was VERY easy. XP really knows what plug and play means. ALL, and I mean ALL of my peripherals were found and configured automatically.
Once installed, you will be prompted to activate. This was an easy and fast process. The next thing it will do is set up your Internet access. Once this is done, you are now ready to go. You will notice right away that the interface is different and very colorful. It may take a little while to get used to but once you do, you will like it. You also have an option of a ""classic"" Windows 9x view.
Windows XP makes a lot of functions very easy. First of all, depending on your BIOS and motherboard, you can tell Windows just what to do when you press your power button. It also has built in CD burning capability, however, to delete a file from a CD-RW, you must erase the CD and then put back the files you want. A little inconvenient but a lot more stable than DirectCD. It is VERY easy to set up individual users. You can set up a personalized account for each member of the family. Also, when installing many programs, it will detect XP and ask if you want certain people to access the program. This is very nice and secure. And with Internet Explorer 6.0, you can now choose the level of cookie protection. You will be amazed on how many third party ""usage tracking"" cookies that are placed on your PC.
Backward compatibly is very good to excellent with XP. XP ran all of my older windows based programs and MOST of my DOS games. A few DOS games worked about 80% and some not at all. I am sure that ""DOS EMULATORS"" will be available for purchase in the near future.
Windows XP seemed designed for Internet integration. Just about every major function in XP has a tie to the Internet. And because of this, Microsoft has included a built in Firewall. It is good, but I would recommend Norton Internet Security 2002.
For those of you who are worried about compatibility, Windows XP makes it pretty easy to set up a dual boot. All you need is a partition created before installing. After that, Windows does the rest.
For those who want security, go with Windows XP Professional. Everyone else can get by with Windows XP Home. If you have a previous copy of Windows, get the UPGRADE version. It will search for a previous install or ask you for the original Windows 9.x/2000 disk to verify.
There is a lot more I can say about Windows XP but you just need to see it for yourself. If you want stability, awesome Internet integration and overall easy of use, you must get this upgrade."
love my magazine
"When I got this the Norton page didn't have the ""Mac OS X 10.7 only"" warning. My Mac is about 3 years old so I wasn't thinking it was that out of date, but I guess if I want virus protection I will have to upgrade as Norton tech support told me there is no alternative product for slightly older Mac operating systems."
"Reading every new issue of First is like sitting down for a chat with a friend. Get yourself a cup of coffee, put your feet up -- and it's an instant little vacation. I have honestly learned some very valuable facts from this entertaining women's publication. Fashion, food, family, the work place, money issues, hobbies... What more could you ask?"
"I own the 2007 version (3 licenses) and tried the starter version that came with my new computer.
I see no great improvement, for my needs.
Someone else may think differently, depending on his/her needs.
For now I am sticking with MS Office 2007.
Right now this is my verdict on this new version, that costs upwards of a hundred dollars.
Tell me if I am wrong."
"I am a stickler for software that does a lot and it equally as easy to use. This was not one of those products. Although I use Corel's Video software (it took me a while to learn that one too)but I think if I had to choose between this product and Photoshop, I'd stick with Photoshop. I've had this software for a while and it often, 90% of the time, freezes up and crashes. I have gone to the manufacturer website and download updates and patches for the software, but it just won't act right. It takes forever to load, locks my computer up for a few minutes, and if I try to something else, like run another program, this program crashes. Thankfully it doesn't crash my entire system. It would appear that this product uses entirely too much memory, which is a bit ironic considering the video version of this software works just fine.

I've recently noticed that there is an X5 released or soon to be released. Hopefully, Corel has addressed these problems in the new product."
"I live in an area where Rosetta Stone heavily markets their products to the aging and retiring baby-boomers that have all been told by their General Physicians to start studying a new language to help stave of the onset of Alzheimer's. Being 36 years old myself, I have yet to worry about that just yet.

At nearly four hundred dollars though, the entry price on this is a bit of a downer. When you look at things in terms of price points, that kind of money, in this economy -- doesn't bode well. I'm reminded of a quote by Matt Damon in the film Good Will Hunting:

""You dropped a hundred and fifty grand on an education you coulda' picked up for a dollar fifty in late charges at the Public Library.""

Yes, your local public library probably has a multitude of learning materials for learning Spanish. A language that is still difficult, but definitely not as difficult as Chinese. If you live in the United States, you would also be hard pressed not to be able to find, or even know, and be friends with some folks who either speak Spanish fluently or do so as native speakers. The Spanish language is so ubiquitous in the US now, a person could almost learn the language just from riding the city bus.

So, the point I'm making here is a simple one. Do you need to drop $400 to learn Spanish? The answer is simple. No. I think of Rosetta Stone like a gym membership. They're expensive and often tedious to pay, but worth it only if you use it.

The product itself is quite good though, if you already have moved past any concerns of money. The system Rosetta Stone employs is state of the art, as they say, and they do their best to immerse you into the language immediately. It really is unlike any other Spanish Language program that's out there for the purchase. So there really is no comparison.

Having been a previous customer with the Rosetta Stone Japanese 1,2,3 ... I was pleased to sharpen my skills in Spanish. Both of them are a fantastic product to say the least.

I give it four stars. One minus for the price."
1 star for the website giving me such problems! Bought off amazon...no issues.
"Bitdefender has a nice assortment of features, but from my experience, this package just wasn't ready for the market. I hardly even had the opportunity to test out the software because it crashed my computer almost immediately after install.

Back to McAfee for me...  I don't love McAfee, but it's better than this."
"I'm in charge of keeping 5 computers healthy and bug-free (two at home, 3 at work), so I am always on the lookout for easy programs that work quietly in the background to keep them all working well.

All my computers are currently running this setup:
Avira AntiVir Personal (free edition at home, paid at work)
Windows Defender (free)
CC Cleaner  (free)
Ad Aware (free)
AusLogics Disk Defrag (free)
Eusing Free Registry Cleaner (free)
Spybot - Search & Destroy (free)

Some of these programs run in the background and offer protection (Avira, Windows Defender).  The others I run about once a month, more frequently if we're adding or removing lots of programs.

In testing Spyware Doctor, I used my laptop as the first guinea pig.  Initially I booted the computer up and measured the time it took - just under a minute.  Without running any regular scans, I uninstalled all the above named products, and re-booted twice, again checking the time it took - again just under a minute.

I installed Spyware Doctor and did two boots - checking the clock on the second boot - startup now takes nearly 3 minutes.

I updated Spyware Doctor and ran a full scan.  The Doctor caught 7 groups of items, 1 'critical' and the rest 'negligible'.  After checking through the list, I determined that many of the negligibles were cookies I wanted to keep.  I de-selected these and had the Doctor clean the rest.

Next, I re-installed my regular regimen of free programs.  Running Ad-Aware, CC Cleaner and Spybot gleaned a total of more than 70 items that Spyware Doctor missed.  There were two critical items and the rest were just cookies and other junk that gets dumped on our computers when we surf the net.  Not really security issues but not necessary either.

For the next test, I moved to my desktop at home.  This has the same regimen of free programs.  I ran all those programs first, finding and deleting about 40 items in all.  I uninstalled the freeware and installed Spyware Doctor.  Startup times again increased by about 45 seconds to 1 minute.  I ran Spyware Doctor, which found 4 negligibles that were cookies I wanted to keep.

So, is Spyware Doctor a good product?  Yes, it does a decent job of finding and removing junk.  It is simple to use and is a great option for people who don't want to worry about an active defense.

Would I recommend it to everyone?  No.  If you are willing to spend a few minutes a month running a couple of free programs, you will have slightly better results and your computer will boot up and run faster.  You will save money.

It's up to the individual user to decide which category they fall in.  If you are willing to take some effort, go for the free programs.  If you don't want the hassle, purchase Spyware Doctor."
"This is pricey, but the results are worth it.  Skin feel silky and the aroma is wonderful.  Not much is needed for results, so it does last a long time.  I will keep coming back to buy it on Amazon because I have not found it locally."
"Consumer Reports is the main magazine of the largest and oldest consumer organization in the world.  They have other publications and a great (not free) website.  They don't accept advertising or allow companies to use their reviews to market their products.  It's a great magazine to read for fun, and I wouldn't think of buying anything significant without consulting it, as it educates about features and other issues about products.  They're particularly good on new and used cars, and take one through the whole purchasing process.  One aspect I really enjoy is the amazing charts and tables.  And the inside back cover has hysterically funny and ironic 'mistakes' made in companies' advertisements.  One isn't always going to agree with their reviews -- individuals may value aspects of a product that they consider trivial -- but not reading their reviews to learn about what's out there would be a big mistake."
"I'm 25 and I've been reading Reader's Digest for years.  I remember moving into a new house and finding a stash of old Large Print Reader's Digests in the garage and I spent days poring over them.

I agree that there is an overabundance of ads these days...some months it really seems like there's nothing left after pulling out the cards.  With all that advertising, you'd think they could lower the price a bit.  I usually pay less than 1/3 of the cover price, but even so, it seems like I should be getting more book and less bulk.

My boyfriend and I enjoy sharing the jokes and stories and I'm always excited to see it in the mailbox."
"I like this magazine, and it has lots of helpful articles on everything from baking to rated cosmetics."
Nice gift card
Fine....not much difference from earlier versions.
"It takes a while to get the hang of creating animation with Anime Studio, but once you do learn it, it does provide a fairly quick way to produce very basic but smooth animation.

The learning curve is frustrating, though. I've studied digital animation, but the approach here is a bit different. Characters are built on skeletons, and you have to determine how flexible you want joints to be. That took some getting used to.

There are exercises designed to help you learn the program, but they're not the clearest and kind of boring. Videos that show you exactly what you're supposed to do would have been more helpful, and allowing users greater freedom would have made it less tedious. I would not recommend this program for kids younger than 13 simply because it is a little hard to learn.

If you want to create animation for YouTube or something similar, and you have the time to learn it, this is an okay place to start."
"I hate doing this to the vendor, but it is clear from my experience and other reviews that there are major issues with this software. Even when you use the download option instead of the DVD, the install fails. I've tried it on three different machines, and all I get is a 5 minute wait and then an error about pre-requisites.

I'll attempt again when/if there is a new update."
"Very good software! It wants to control everything, but you can tune it just the way you want. Every since I switched to this software I have been virus free with all my devices, Plus this program requires very little RAM and does not take up a lot of space like other programs do. buy this from amazon, they offer different buying options, bottom line you will get a better deal at Amazon, I,m a life long customer."
"I have a number of different computers and devices, including a mac laptop, windows desktop, ipad, and galaxy s3 phone, so this product definitely intrigued me.

Setup is awkward and confusing.  It comes with a single windows disk and a piece of paper telling you that you should go to norton's website.  There on norton's website, it asks you to create or login to your existing account, where it will present you with a ""device manager"".  You can ""add a device"" and select the type of device.  If it's an ios or android device, it will send you an email, with a link to their app in either the apple or android online store.  You download the app, launch it, login to your account, and it's up and running.  For a mac, it just downloads the app directly to your machine, and you can run the installer.

Most people with computers know what the norton suite traditionally does.  Mainly virus prevention and removal.  But it does something completely different for mobile devices.  First, it has ""anti-theft"" features.  You login to your same online norton account, and from there you can locate your device (brings up a map and shows you where it is), or lets you ""scream"" (make a loud alarm sound to scare the would-be thief).  It also lets you backup your contacts.

Also when you launch the app on Android it lets you run a malware scan, which also reports ""privacy risks"", which is actually kind of cool in that it tells you what information certain apps are collecting.

Overall I think this is a good product.  If you have a computer you really should be getting some sort of protection like this anyway, and if you also have mobile devices this is kind of a no-brainer.  I'm only giving it 4 stars because the installation is kind of baffling and overly complicated, and in the case of Apple mobile devices, the features that find your phone or send messages etc are superflous because those features already exist as part of ""icloud"" which you get for free."
"I've used Peter Norton programs since the days of CPM and found them to be simple, easy to use and well engineered.  However, this Ghost 12.0 program leaves a lot to be desired before it becomes User friendly.  I assume some outside software engineering company in China designed this program for them.

1.) The program is very slow to load.
2.) Instructions are very hard to follow and you don't get a manual.  The only manual that I could find on-line to print out, was for version 10.
3.) The program is a stand-along and does not intergrate into the System Works Program like their AntiVirus does.
4.) There is no sync feature.
5.) You can't rename your backup profiles without re-entering them.
6.) Their program rating form is joke.  Give them a sad smiling face (low-rating) and your not allowed to forward the survey...
7.) I backup to 2 external drives and I'm alway getting error messages.  One error message said that Norton didn't know what to do inorder to correct the program.

In my opinion, I would never recommend that someone buy this expensive program.  After 12 revisions, they still don't know what to do with it so it's User friendly.  Go buy something else."
We enjoy reviewing the different and unique products shown in the magazine.  We have went through the reference web sites and purchased product as shown in the magazine..........
with all the gift cards I purchased at Amazon we all can enjoy Starbucks drinks thanks amazon for coming on time!
"I took a chance on this Instant Immersion Spanish software because the product description said that it was only for Windows; however, the photo showed ""PC and Mac"" on the spine of the box.  Since I knew that the all-access portion worked on iPads, I figured that reinforced my hunch.  And yes, it does work with Mac and iPad, as well as Windows 8.1 machines.  (I have not tried it with Windows 10.)

To start learning Spanish, all you need to do is pop in the software DVD and install it on your computer.  If you do not have a DVD drive or if you are installing on a tablet, you need to visit the website to enter your email address and product key to begin the download.  The box also contains an interactive DVD and an MP3 audio CD.  I like that I can copy the audio to iTunes, although it's a little weird how it adds files to my Mac desktop in order to accomplish this.  It sounds like an extended game of Pong.

The software itself is pretty good, although your success will depend in part on how well you tend to grasp foreign languages.  All the PR around Instant Immersion language courses compares them to Rosetta Stone.  I can't make the comparison myself, having never tried Rosetta Stone, but I do know that this is a relatively easy method of teaching yourself Spanish, as long as you take advantage of all the tools.  I find that the trio of reading, speaking, and listening to the same words and phrases helps me learn faster.  I've tried other language courses that leave out one or the other, and that's much more difficult.  The pocket phrase guide, while extremely portable, is difficult to see with older eyes, and it's not necessarily easy to find what I want, even though the words/phrases are grouped by subject, such as days of the week or transportation.  Still, it's better than no guide at all.

This software teaches Latin American Spanish, which is great for most Americans but not so great if you plan to go to Spain.  I cannot find a way to change to European Spanish, so I assume that option is not available.  The iPad Talk Now app mirrors the computer version, which makes it easy to train yourself on one, then switch off to the other.  The Oscar Lake game will appeal to a wide range of ages.

I've used an older Instant Immersion program for Italian, and I find this newer version of the software to be less clunky and visually more friendly, something that's important if children will be using it.  This program is best for learning a smattering of Spanish, not for an in-depth learning program that covers the finer points of grammar and word nuances.  If your aim is to be able to converse a little or understand important written words, this is a great program.

-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"
"I'm still working through the basics. So far, this is an awesome package. Chinese is tough because of the strange alphabet and the language is totally different from English. Even though I have a busy schedule, I'm still able to learn Chinese bit by bit in the time that I do have. This is an expensive package, but worth it. It's nice to be able to go at your own pace. I would not call myself intellectual, but Rosetta Stone makes learning languages a fun hobby.

Included in this package are:
* printed manuals (very nice - a lot of software packages neglect these)
* software CDs for all 3 levels
* audio companion CDs for all 3 levels
* USB headphone and microphone set

The software allows you to focus on the aspects of the language you want to learn first and provides you a total immersion environment. Rather than dull repetition, the software guides you through the learning process with related graphics so you see & hear the words at the same time.

Even with all the goodies, the work isn't done for you, as with anything if you want to learn it, you do have to put some effort into it."
"While in middle school and high school we were required to take a foreign language course, so I ended up taking French, Spanish, and Japanese. Eventually French was the only one I continued through high school and eventually college.  Since then, I have never had a need to use French so I have pretty much forgotten all I've learned.  I later realized Spanish was a language I could have use for today, but my past Spanish computer courses I've purchases not helpful at all and downright boring.  RosettaStone was going to be my next purchase until I saw the price; much more expensive than I expected it to be.  I eventually planned on getting it, but not anytime in the foreseeable future.  I had an opportunity to try and keep the Spanish version of RosettaStone so you can image I jumped on the opportunity quickly.

As I am going through Level 1 of the three level course, I am finding out already that I am enjoying RosettaStone's approach to learning as opposed to the other courses I have had.  RosettaStone uses a ""Dynamic Immersion"" approach which basically teaches you the language very similar to the way you learned your first language.  After the very first lesson I found myself being able to associate everyday objects with the things I learned in the language.  More importantly it seems to stick.  My high school French teacher taught us that repetition is the key to learning a new language and if you don't use it then you will lose it.  RosettaStone follows this same principle; at the beginning of every lesson the software always goes over what you've learned in the previous lessons to reinforce what you've learned.  It also comes with audio companion CD's you can listen to in your car or at work that will also go over with what has been learned.

The RosettaStone software focuses on four major areas; reading, speaking, writing, and vocabulary.  Most of the reading and vocabulary exercises require you matching up pictures up with what the speaker says and what displays on the screen.  Pronunciation exercises require you to repeat what the speaker says with the provided USB Headphones/microphone.  Writing exercises require you to write/spell in Spanish using the on screen keyboard.  The software even comes with stickers you can place over your existing keyboard to make typing easier.  RosettaStone is very visual which is important to learning a new language.  From what I have observed, RosettaStone does not use translations at all. Instead, with the aid of visual references it actually teaches Spanish independent of your native language.  So instead of trying to remember ""una manzana"" = apple or ""un huevo"" = egg, you are taught to associate the word, phrase, or sentence with a mental picture which I think makes things stick.  Keep in mind this is just one example of how RosettaStone teaches you your new language.

Honestly, after going through to first few lessons, while I agreed I was learning, I didn't think I was learning THAT much, however that view changed when the software required me to identify objects and phrases on the screen by spelling them without any help from the speaker.  I thought I would fail the lesson, but I surprised myself; ending up getting all but one correct.  It was as if I was doing the activity subconsciously.

My only real complaint was the poor customer service experience I had when calling RosettaStone Customer Support to inform them that the Spanish Keyboard stickers were printed incorrectly.  On Spanish keyboards pressing Shift + a number 4 - 0 will produce a different character than an English keyboard:

On a Spanish Keyboard, pressing shift in conjunction with numbers 4 - 0 should produce the following characters:

Shift + 4 = ""$""
Shift + 5 = ""%""
Shift + 6 = ""&""
Shift + 7 = ""/""
Shift + 8 = ""(""
Shift + 9 = "")""
Shift + 0 = ""=""

However the Spanish stickers included with RosettaStone are printed as:

Shift + 4 = ""%""
Shift + 5 = ""&""
Shift + 6 = ""/""
Shift + 7 = ""(""
Shift + 8 = "")""
Shift + 9 = ""=""
Shift + 0 =

After being on hold for nearly 20 minutes, I finally get to a live person, I tried to explain the issue to the customer service rep, but this guy was completely clueless on what I was talking about and the only solution was for me to press the shift button...ok.  Before getting too involved with a long drawn out frustrating conversation, I asked to speak to someone else.  He transfers me and again I am on hold for a long period of time before speaking to a ""senior technical rep"" I tell her the issue and she tells me that she can just have RosettaStone send me more keyboard stickers.  I am transferred again, and yet again am on hold for a while.  When speaking to the new person, she informs me that RosettaStone does NOT send out the stickers separately, but suggested I buy some from another company for $12.  When I tell her that the keyboard stickers are printed incorrectly she says she would bring it to someone's attention...yeah right.  After wasting nearly an hour with RosettaStone Customer Support I hung up more dissatisfied then I was when I first called.  In fact the original issue wasn't really a big of a deal, but I felt the need to let someone know so they could fix it for future customers; but instead, I get bad customer service.  I eventually fixed the stickers myself with the help of a razor, simply putting the symbols above the numbers in their correct places.

Other than the bad customer service experience, my only concern right now is that the course may be rather short even though it's three levels.  I am still very early in the course so perhaps that may not be a concern at all.  Also since I am very early in the course, there is no way I can honestly say if it's worth the hefty price tag, but I will say I am very impressed so far, and am very eager to continue my learning.  However be aware if you need to call customer support that you will be on hold for a while and there is no guarantee that they will even be able to help you plus they are not the most polite people I have had to deal with but hopefully you won't even have to deal with them.

Independent of the customer service I'll give it a rounded up value of 5, but the bad customer service experience is something I can't ignore, so for that it gets a 4."
"I started using HR Block a few years ago and used Turbo Tax before that. I can say that the 2010 HR Block is the same easy to use software as the past few years. Some may gripe that the deduction software must be accessed online vs being installed on your computer, but the functionality is still the same and you can save the deduction file to your PC. I also want people to know that I tried the online HR Block and could not get it to import my info from last year. The downloaded software imported everything fine and I had no issues. After doing my taxes with 2010 HR Block, I used Turbo Tax Deluxe to compare my numbers and try their software. Turbo tax was a pain to use for child care tax credit and also with some tax exempt interest I had. I preferred the experience with the HR Block software."
Just not into magazines too many ads. But great price.
As expected.
Great !!!

"I've been a subscriber for many years. Martha's magazine is always filled with beautiful images and great-looking recipes. her suggestions for housekeeping, gardening, and decorating are always tasteful and useful. I particularly like her holiday recipe selections.

My main complaint about her magazine are the recipes. The food looks great, but the recipes I've made are fairly on the bland side and overcomplicated. I immediately pass over recipes with ingredients I cannot find in the supermarket or recipes which require 7-10 eggs and endless beating. I have come to the conclusion that I prefer recipes which are spicier than Martha does and desserts which are less frou frou. In fact, I prefer her FOOD magazine for recipes.

4 stars. I'm a lifetime subscriber, but I wish the recipes were a little more to my taste. They seem geared more toward goumand foodies than your average joe."
"The product is great, but when installing it over a previous version with fewer user licenses, and remaining time on its subscription, (my situation), the installation was very frustrating. Working with Symantec's tech support was necessary to resolve my nightmare, but Norton 360 is great. I've been using N360 and Norton Internet Security products for years, and would not feel comfortable without it."
"PhotoDirector is a picture editing program that works on both Mac and PC. I installed it first on my MacBook and ran into a few challenges. Since my laptop is a lightweight one that has no CD/DVD drive, I downloaded the software. I experienced some confusion on the site due to popups that would not close (on Safari browser). The download at 247 MB was very slow.

For some reason I had to register twice. Then immediately I downloaded an update in order to get the current version. This one was 242 MB, almost as large as the original download. Clicking on Install said it would take 516 MB on the computer. However, it installed quickly.

Later my husband installed the program on his PC using the DVD. It went smoothly and he was able to register it using my name, so obviously you are allowed to use two copies. (Many programs are like this now.) He was satisfied with what it will do.

I am a long-time user of Adobe Photoshop so I found this program a bit awkward to adjust to. I found tutorials on the Cyberlink site and watched one, but then decided that just playing with the program is an adequate approach. I wasn't thrilled with how you open a file because I am used to Adobe Bridge and the way it interacts with Camera Raw and Photoshop. (If you use Photoshop and either Bridge or Lightroom, you probably know how beautifully they enhance each other.) Once I got my file selected and imported, things went smoothly.

I was impressed that PhotoDirector has a face tagging feature for identifying people who appear in multiple photos. It also has a content-aware feature (as does Photoshop) which promises to be very useful.

I think that if you have never used Photoshop, you will be happy with Photodirector. It has more features than some of the cheap photo software and is more than adequate for most purposes. We haven't used it for very long but I'd say you get a very good program for a reasonable price."
What's to go wrong with a gift card.  As long as it enters into a person's account as a credit it is just what you paid for.
"The good news: Smart Surfing was easy to install and easy to configure. It can run checks on your existing files to look for malicious code.

The bad news: Although the software initially seemed to work fairly transparently, after a system reboot it kept me from being able to access the Internet using either Safari or Firefox. And this on the least intrusive settings.

The in-between news: It was easy to use Smart Surfing to check for malicious code on my previously unprotected (for years) Mac, and I was glad that it found nothing bad lurking on my drives. On the other hand, that also suggests that whatever I've BEEN doing (ie, surfing with reasonable caution) combined with the natural safety of the Mac OS, is all the protection I needed. If Smart Surfing was less expensive (and didn't bring my browsers to a halt), I might like having it as a safety net. But at this price, it just didn't measure up.

In fairness, I'll say that some of the protective features are probably useful for people who are inexperienced on the web, or who share their computers with inexperienced people. Additionally, the ability to block entire catagories of websites (like adult sites) could be useful for families with kids using the computer."
"Quicken Legal Business Pro 2011 is meant for owners of small to medium businesses.  However, it contains a large amount of information that makes it handy to non-business owners as well.  Many subjects are covered, including buying and selling real estate, leasing, contracts, tax forms, managing finances, etc.  The software itself is fairly intuitive to use."
"I was happy with PowerDirector until it started crashing my computer and then refusing to let me render in the resolution it was rendering in when it crashed.  Every time it crashed, I lost a resolution until I was down to nearly nothing.  Boy, was I glad Corel VideoStudio came along.  I initially installed VideoStudio on my Windows 7 system.  Then, I upgraded Windows 7 to Windows 10.  It worked on both systems without crashing either one.  Woohoo!

One of the things I noticed right off the bat is screen video capture.  I'm so happy to have that.  For years, the only way for me to screen capture was point a camera at my screen (yeah, I know about free software).  This also has a slideshow wizard, but what I wanted most was a video wizard.  As far as I can see, there's no such luck.  Oh, well.  I'm happy to see it can edit six cameras.  My old video editor could only handle four.  I haven't challenged it yet, but it is the coolest feature.  That can really make a video look all pro.

I'm still learning my way around this software, so maybe there are things that are there that I don't know about.  So far, I've made a few basic videos for YouTube I've found that and VideoStudio is similar in feel to PowerDirector, but some things aren't as intuitive, or maybe I've just been with PowerDirector so long that anything else feels alien.

The videos have turned out great, though, unlike Windows Movie Maker which makes my videos somewhat grainy.  It's more powerful than Windows Movie Maker and has more options."
A very apt ap! Great price as well. :-)
"Update to below review: I did promise to come back if I found any problems with this product. Some users have experienced reduced battery power (drains faster) after installing it.  I have experienced that but my husband did not.  We are both on macbooks.  My macbook is a year old and his is three years old. I ended up taking my machine into the genius bar.  Apple said iM was not snow leopard.  It said my battery was shot so it gave me a new battery, no charge. my machine has worked like a champ ever since and I still have snow leopard.

This is my original review before the above came to light.  The product remains five stars for me personally.

I am just discovering all the refinements which have gone into Snow Leopard.  However, what I want to comment on is the most important aspect to me.  I came to my Macbook from years of working on PCs.  One good thing PCs did for me was that I became quite a proficient little techie but that was because I was forced to do so.  I lost count of the amount of times I had to reinstall my operating system due to an overall system crash, an Internet Explorer flaw which crashed the whole OS, viruses or trojans or other problems which got past my virus protection software, etc., etc., When I went over to Mac, I was able to retire from being a self taught techie.  I have to do just about zilch on my macbook in order to keep it running well.  I have now used Tiger, Leopard and Snow Leopard.  Each one is an improvement over the last.  There is no bloating factor.  I don't have a bunch of extra software on here which I don't need.  In fact, I picked up about 18 GB of space by switching to Snow Leopard from Leopard.  Snow Leopard is working perfectly for me 24/7 and I have not really had to think about adapting to it.  It is so intuitive that I just find myself doing so automatically.

I always liked the finder and I like it even better now in Snow Leopard.  I've been doing great searches within my folders, getting wonderfully sized images as my thumbnails plus Quick Look is better than ever.  As I set all of my preferences for the whole OS, I discovered that certain things, which were more complicated to do in Leopard, are now simpler to do.  Some specs were removed entirely and macbook just does them quietly on its own in the background, which is fine by me.  I do not miss the hours I spent reading computer manuals as I tried to cope with being a PC user.

After the installation, everything still worked just fine.  I was able to just pick off where I had left off without missing a beat.  I have a David Pogue missing manual book sitting next to me but have yet to open it as I've run into no problems.

Best of all, it was really cheap to buy.  I've never had such a cheap OS yet it is so slick!!!!

It is hard for me to imagine why you would not want Snow Leopard on your Mac.  If I run into such a reason, I will come back and edit this review to include it!"
"I do.  I always tell the girls that.  Really, lipstick and mascara!  Nothing else is needed!  So, yes, I had the talk with the teenage girl again.  ""Stop putting the makeup junk all over your face!!!  Your face is beautiful!  Why make it all funny colors?""

She liked the way this one felt when she cleaned (all the gunk off) her face.  She said it didn't feel like it was all burning like one of our recent experiments.  (Don't ask, don't tell.  LOL.)  She said it felt more lotiony.

I hope this one works better at cleaning her face.  I wish she would stop putting stuff all over it."
"The photos are, of course, absolutely fabulous too."
Good gift card. Good food.
This was a great gift for a high school graduate who was joining the Navy ands can't take any personal possessions. He loved it!
"I have the cheapest full Android phone that is available with no contract on the WalMart TMobile plan:  the Concord.  I am not putting specs, but if your phone is of a similar line, then you know who you are.

I was not able to install Kaspersky Lab Security for Android, because I did not have enough free memory on my phone.  I went through each application on my phone and deleted as many as I could, and I still couldn't install Kaspersky

I only got my phone about 4 months ago, so I would expect anything to run on it.  My version of the Android operating system is compatible with Kaspersky.  That is not the issue.  Instead, the issue is that Kaspersky wants more free memory.  And, I am unable to go on Kaspersky's website and find a full requirements for a phone.

The install process, in a perfect world would go as follows:
-  You order this and get a card in the mail with the serial number for your license.
-  The card tells you to and you type a URL on Kaspersky's website into your phone.  Then your phone downloads a file, but Kaspersky's website does not pop up any sort of confirmation message, so it's up to you to check downloads.
-  You go to your downloaded file and try to run it.
-  You get two options for how to run it:  through the Play Store, or from the file.  I tried the through the Play Store option and got nothing - no reaction from the phone.  I think tried from the file, and to do that, I had to turn off my phone's security setting which was set to not allow installing apps except from the Play Store (so that I can't just browse to a malware site and accidentally install software).
-  Then, for me, my phone said not enough memory, free up memory.  So, I looked on my computer to try and find specs for phones to run this.  All I could find were ""Android 2.3 - 4.2"" and ""Minimum screen resolution 320 x 480"".  My phone has that.  What my phone is lacking is memory.  I opted to give up, rather than try to uninstall other apps or modify settings without knowing how much memory I had to free up.
-  Rather than continuing the attempted install, I went back through my phone's security settings to not allow apps to install unless I get them from the Play Store.

Overall, if you have a high end newer speced out Android phone, you can probably count on Kaspersky installing.  If you are the unwashed masses, with a low end low specs Android phone, don't count on it."
"Caution: You should care about stealth marketing and wrong reviews.

Generally, Windows 10 is the worst operating system. You should not use it. Windows 10 is inferior to Windows 7. So, Windows 10 is useless in the world.

You may have one question. [Why is Windows 10 inferior to Windows 7?] Actually, Microsoft wants to unite some OSs to one OS. Some OSs include laptop PC, desktop PC, TV game, mobile phone. It can realize that Microsoft create OS with lower cost. But, it has some problems. [Some hardware with high performance] must fit lower performance hardware. Therefore, Windows 10 makes desktop PC inferior than Windows 7.

Additionally, Windows 10 has worse functions than Windows 7. Lower security, lower flexibility, and lower option. For example, Windows 10 cannot select security programs. Although Windows 7 can select updated programs in a list of downloadable security software.

Finally, Windows 10 has many malfunctions. For example, many computers with Windows 7 were upgraded to Windows 10, and were crashed. Moreover, certain update software (called Windows 10 anniversary update) has broken many computers.

Conclusion: We must not use Windows 10 forever."
Great magazine.  The stories are interesting and give me new things to think about in my career
"Quick drying formula means I can put on a coat in the morning and still be out the door in no time.  I only use it without polish and it makes my nails shiny and strong.  So far, no splitting or peeling even though I've been working with chemicals this week, specifically water based paints and various household cleaning products.  The shine remained even after I peeled latex paint off my nails.  Impressive!"
"I still like the magazine BHG; however, I wasn't pleased with your service especially when it came to renewing subscriptions.  It seemed to be too much of my time spent on the computer and sorting through all my subscriptions as to what was renewed, the cost, etc."
"I love the convenience of gift cards being able to be received electronically. It makes it so easy to purchase a gift card, print it out or even show it on my mobile device. Delivery is typically very fast when receiving them by email. This makes gift giving exceptionally easy. I love that you can pick you own amount to load on as well. Will definitely use this type of service again."

"COREL ULEAD VIDEO STUDIO is a digital movie editing software program which is easy to use. In addition to my personal use to product review it, by himself my twelve year old taught himself to use it to make YouTube videos from recordings of him playing video games and made title pages and subtitles.

We wanted to use this product to create short movies for fun and to edit family home videos for better viewing experiences (cut out the garbage and to summarize). This product is fine for that use.

We also can add text such as titles and textual information in the video.

Our family is happy with this product and I rate this 5 stars = I Love It."
"Right now, there are a pleethora of options for internet security on the market. Of course there are the big hitters, Microsoft, McAfee and Norton's to name a few. With so many options out there, the normal end user can be left feeling a little shell-shocked and usure of just what to get.

If you are anything like me the first thing you do is turn the box over and look for 'the grid'. The grid tells you what is covered by that particular set-up and what is not. Usually this is just a sly way of trying to get you to buy the more expensive version that covers everything. The problem with that is, end users like myself don't always need the 'everything' option. Sometimes the simple version is better. The less options I have the less likely I am to screw something up, right?

I will spare you all the tech talk, because a) others have done it a lot better than I ever could, and b) I would probably screw it up anyway.

I have been a Norton's user for years. I had fallen into a rut of purchasingt he latest addition and just accepting the drawbacks because I didn't want to deal with the hassle switching things over. Well, this issue of Norton's has made that a lot harder. It's simplistic, intuitive, and makes sense, but more importantly it doesn't require a lot from me. So, that really means less for me to screw up.

Two things I am disapointed about.

1 - no instruction manual. Give me something, anything to read and reference when I get these pop-up messages. I want to make informed decisions. I am not always able to do that.

2 - I loathe when a company makes you pay to talk to tech suppor. The minimum call is $9.99. So, at a minimum if you call you are dropping ten bucks. Not cool. If I am a customer, they should be looking to help me get the most out of the product, not the most out of my wallet.

If you are looking for a new internet security program, or are looking to upgrade take a look at this one. Don't settle for the first thing you see. Do some research and find the product that meets what you want. There are too many options out there right now to settle for what the product offers. Make it work for you."

"Easy to install and has not crashed my computer so far.  The interface is pretty simple and easy to use.  Doesn't seem to use too many resources.  No problems with malware so far, at least as far as I can tell.  I like link protectors so you don't accidentally go to a suspicious website, but this product is their more basic version, so doesn't provide for one.  If your computer can handle it (i.e. not a netbook or single processor computer) then you should probably spring a little extra money for a fuller suite of protection.  I have used older versions of Norton and the newer versions of McAfee in the past."
"This is an old Nancy Drew game. But I've learned not to pre-judge the older games; it's the plot and puzzles that drive these games, not the graphics. That said, this game was not mind-blowing. If you want to go for a classic Nancy Drew title, I would suggest the game that came after this, Treasure in the Royal Tower (#4). I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.

PLOT - 4/5: Nancy is off to San Francisco to help a friend of Hannah's renovate a Victorian mansion. This friend, Rose Green, spent her life savings on the historic home and plans to turn it into a Bed & Breakfast. But strange accidents have been setting back the renovations and if things keep going badly Rose will have to sell the house and lose her investment.

I thought this was an alright plot,  it was very short though. On the back of the CD case it said ""20+ hours of gameplay"", but I finished mine in about 4 hours. Other than that, there were lots of snooping opportunities - in fact, Nancy gets to snoop through all four of the suspects' things. The plot flowed nicely and there was enough progression in the story that I never felt stuck in the same place for too long. But it wasn't as educational as other games have been. I love San Francisco and it would have been great if they had included more information about its Victorian houses, its role in the Gold Rush, how it recovered from the earthquake of 1906, or how its Chinese history influences its style and culture - really, any of those things would have been great because it gave you little tid-bits about each of them but not nearly enough information to be considered ""educational"". Which is a shame really because the plot and setting gave the game the perfect set up; it could have seamlessly put in so much information without having the player feel like ""Oh great, here comes another history lesson.""

CHARACTERS - 3.5/5: The suspect list in this game is pretty straightforward. There are two male suspects and two female suspects (a formula which I believe is pretty common to the earlier ND titles). The suspects include Rose Green, the owner of the mansion, a quiet woman who didn't have too much to say throughout the game. Abby Sideris, a friend of Rose's and is also co-owner of the mansion, who believes the mansion is haunted. Charlie Murphy, a college student and inexperienced handyman helping with renovating the mansion (Charlie was voiced by Scott Carty, who does Ned's voice in the later games). Louis Chandler is an antique dealer specializing in Victorian era furniture and decorations.

The graphics were... interesting - but I wasn't expecting a whole lot considering it's an older game. Louis was probably the strangest to talk to because it would seem that sometimes his eyes would be closed for an entire conversation, which may or may not have been a glitch in my game. The characters were not too memorable. Rose and Louis were particularly boring. I don't know if the voice acting on these characters was just bland or if their characters were meant to be more reserved.

Phone friends included Bess and George, a woman named Emily who is apparently a friend of Nancy's in San Francisco, and Hannah. In the books Hannah is the Drew's live-in house keeper who is practically a surrogate mother to Nancy, and the games also allude to the fact that Hannah is an important part of the Drew family. This was the first time I've been able to talk to Hannah in a Nancy Drew game. But Hannah's voice was really odd, like a young person that was obviously trying to sound like an old woman, so I didn't call her very much.

SETTING - 4.5/5: The mansion was very lovely and nicely decorated. It was pretty big too; Nancy can explore her room, the dining room, the basement saloon, the foyer, the parlor, and the library as well as a handful of secret rooms. I sort of wished you could go outside, or look out a window or something, but I guess the weather was supposed to be bad and that was the reason for staying indoors.

PUZZLES - 4.5/5: The puzzles were not too challenging in this game. I suppose that if you struggled with them then you might spend 20+ hours playing the game like the CD case promised. But I have played enough Nancy Drew games to recognize a clue when I see one and got through the puzzles pretty easily. My only complaint would be that at times the instructions were kind of vague, for instance at one point a character asked Nancy to take a look at a puzzle ""in the corner"". I spent over a half an hour looking for that corner before eventually looking it up online and discovering that the puzzle was directly behind the character.

IS IT CHALLENGING? No. I'm starting to wonder if maybe I'm getting better at these games or if I just happen to be playing the easiest titles in the series. Either way, I didn't have to use a walkthrough. I did call Bess and George a lot, though. And they were very explicit with their hints. It wasn't like ""Maybe you should take a look at the library again!"" it was more ""Go into the library, turn left, and read the red book on the middle shelf."" Which was sort of a bummer; I just wanted a push in the right direction, I didn't want to know exactly how to solve the next puzzle and what would happen when I did. I would give the game a 2.5/5 for challenge.

ENDING - 3.5/5: The ending was okay. The culprit was not surprising to me. Catching them took me a few tries even though I knew exactly what to do. But it was still a solid ending and the wrap up in the epilogue at the end was nice.

FINAL SCORE:
Plot: 4
Characters: 3.5
Setting: 4.5
Puzzles: 4.5
Challenge: 2.5
Ending: 3.5
= 22.5 divided by 6 = 3.75 rounded to 4 stars"
It was easy to use.
"I have been using Norton since I got my first computer (usually Frys has it for ""free"" with rebates) but needed this now and Amazon had a great price for this five license.  So my phone, laptop and tablet are protected.  Never had an issue with Norton before and it is all online now (no disc to upload).  I got the Key Card instead of the online version - just want to have something solid to hold onto if something goes wrong!"
Simple to use.  All I had to do was fill in the information required. The tough part is going to get it notarized.
Upgrade worked as described; comes with both 32 or 64 bit disk; installation went smoothly; no great changes from Vista but XP users will see significant change; like the new features.
this was a Christmas gift !!
great reading
"Ok, I do cook a lot, but my hubby is gluten free so a lot of the recipes are unusable, or need modification.

Like all other ""home"" mags it's very consumer-driven. Buy this new cleaner/foundation/moisturizer. Buy these new rugs/lamps/sofas. Buy these backpacks/storage cubes/clothes that are trending now for your kids. Buy, buy, buy. I find this very off-putting.

There are articles on handling family, financial, and social issues, party planning, etc as you would expect. It is very current, with discussions of sex (though not as frank as Redbook is), social media, and other issues.

Bottom line, if you are a modern mom with some disposable income trying to ""do it all and look fabulous"" this is probably right for you. For me, no kids, not so youth-driven, seldom entertain, it's not that interesting."
This program seems to be an excellent program but is a bit difficult to use.  I'm still working with it to learn how it operates.  It functions fast and gives good information back to the user.
Perf.
"I just recently converted to this version from Office 2004 for Mac, and I wish I'd just kept my original software. This version is buggy, slow, and crashes likes someone's paying it to do so I can't tell you how many times Word has crashed in the middle of updating an important file and the supposed ""AutoRecovery"" file is from hours earlier. Yes, it's my own fault for not saving more often, but when you're in the groove, you're in the groove. That doesn't excuse this program's fault, and they've got some nerve charging this much for an update that's not worth the disk it's burned on. I won't even talk about how slow PowerPoint is. It takes a few minutes to open on my brand-new iMac as well as on my 2007 MacBook, so I know it's not processor speed that's causing the problem. In fact, the only program I can recommend on this disk is Excel, and that's bc it's pretty hard to screw that one up.

In this day and age, it's pretty much impossible to be a Mac user working across platforms without having Office, so if you must, take my advice and just stick to 2004. Hopefully they'll get rid of the bugs in the next update, but I'm not holding my breath."
"Norton Security is the latest incarnation or replacement for Norton 360. Norton has revamped their retail security lineup with the home line simplified to pretty much Norton Security with or without backup.

Windows Installation was faster than with older versions of Norton and was pretty painless for me. I did have to restart my Windows 7 Pro desktop. The controls available are pretty basic and there are lots of on/off controls to customize how Norton works. What is missing in this incarnation of Norton Security is the ability to white-list specific directories or files. This caused some consternation for me, but more on that near the end.

In operation on Windows I feel Norton Security is less ""noisy"" than previous versions; I don't feel like I'm constantly being marketed to death. Unlike previous versions of the retail product I didn't perceive my PC running noticeably slower with it in operation. This is a very good thing! The initial full scan turned up a couple of minor items missed by my previous antivirus, but none of these were active viruses. Instead they were inactive left over pieces of already removed viruses.

Application Compatibility Problems:

I use VirtualBox to run a virtual machine on this PC. When I installed Norton Security Virtualbox would not start my virtual machine instance. Virtual box seems to have problems with most recent Symantec antivirus products (including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton-Small-Business/dp/B00JKZPTPC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton Small Business</a>). I was stuck until I upgraded VirtualBox to a version which is newer than the latest official release (as of Oct. 1, 2014). It was good I found a solution because this virtual machine is critical to my business. This was the only application compatibility problem I've come across so far.

Since then I found the settings for exclusions. It isn't on the security page reached via the advanced button as one might expect, but found from the small gear icon for settings at the top of the control panel. The exclusions are buried in this group of settings pages. Go to settings, antivirus, scans tab, to Exclusions/Low Risks and then finally items to exclude.

If you want an integrated on-line backup solution, you might want to consider getting&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton-Security-with-Backup/dp/B00MHZ71G2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton Security with Backup</a>&nbsp;that supports 10 devices and includes 25GB of online backup space. Windows 7 Pro has a very capable backup program that works well with USB or network drives as backup media. For the difference in price it might be well spent if you need online backup and/or more than 5 devices.

Mobile Support:

The IOS app is a disappointment to me. It has a few features which do not include any virus protection:
1) locate your phone: this placed my iPhone 4 a mile way from its actual location!!
2) it can ring your phone: I can just dial the number
3) it has a ""scream"" function: makes your iPhone put out an annoying siren like noise

If the ""scream"" actually sounded like a scream this app would at least have some entertainment value. If you have more devices than the 10 allowed in this product, don't waste one on an IOS device! The IOS support is pretty lame. I have read that Android devices have better support against malware, but I don't have an android device to try this out.

Conclusions:

This incarnation of Symantec's Norton line of retail/home security products is pretty good. It finds things other antivirus products used on this computer did not, and does not seem to slow things down. I had one application that had a problem, but nothing else. Mobile support for iPhone/iPad is poor. The user interface is simple, but does not include some advanced controls like white listing of applications, files or folders. It is probably a good tradeoff for most home users.

Because it's a great product for most people, but I had an application problem and the IOS app is poor I'm giving it 4 stars.

I've made a correction and updated information about setting exclusions for scans. Thanks to Ruth in NM for her helpful comment leading to a more accurate review."
"I am a computer geek. I have a lot of devices, many of those with ethernet ports. For instance, I have a PRISMIQ Media Player that hooks to the TV to watch videos and photos stored on the computer.

That device has BOTH an ethernet port for wired lans, and a PCMCIA slot to insert a wireless networking card, but it must be of a given brand and model (from a list of supported cards).

I wanted to hook the device to my LAN without drilling holes on walls, and I didn't want to have to seek a special pcmcia card. So I went with one Sony PCWA-DE80. I connected to the Prismiq ethernet port and Bingo!, instant wireless connectivity to my Netgear 802.11a Wireless Access Point!.

A bonus with one of these devices you can say GOODBYE to WIFI driver issues. You just need a WIFI access point next to your adsl or cable modem, and this device. Then you can hook ANYTHING with a working ethernet port to your wireless lan!. It could be  a PC or any other device (could be a game console!). You plug the Sony ethernet-to-wifi converter into the device's RJ45 ethernet port and ... instant wireless connectivity. As far as the PC or  device is concerned, it's talking to a wired ethernet, even while it's not, as the sony devices bridges wifi to wired ethernet networks!.

Setup is a breeze. Just point your browser to the devices's IP address and enter your wifi configuration data (supports wep up to 128 bits), the IP address that you want assigned to it, and that's it!. Then when you plug this unit to any device with an ethernet port, that device will immediately connect to your wifi network!. I even used one of these boxes to get instant WiFi connectivity on my old lan server running IBM OS/2, an operating system that doesn't have plenty of WiFi cards supported (if any).

Another bonus: switch operating systems painlessly, don't worry about the availability of wifi drivers!. I test software for a living, so I often find myself installing several flavors of Linux on my notebook. However, availability of Wifi drivers for Linux is scarce. So, instead of having to thinker with the computer, I just tell linux to use the notebook's ethernet port, and I then plug the SONY ethernet to wifi converter and that's it. Instant connection and no need to drill holes on the walls.

The downside: It's expensive, like most Sony gear. You can probably find several less expensive ""ethernet to Wi-Fi"" converters on the market, but to my knowledge the Sony ones are the ONLY that support the 5 Ghz 802.11a standard!, all cheaper devices work ONLY in the 2.4 Ghz frequency, using either 802.11b or 802.11g. I choose 802.11a because, while older, the 5 Ghz band is less prone to interference from 2.4 Ghz cordless phones, microwave ovens (did you know your microwave oven operates at 2.4 ghz?), and wireless security cameras, all of which pollute the 2.4 Ghz frequency spectrum.

The PCWADE80 works BOTH in 2.4 Ghz frequency (802.11b ang ""g"") and also in 802.11a. Unlike the previous model (PCWADE50) this one claims to support 72mbps ""turbo"" mode in 802.11a! (haven't tested it)."
"In these days of online mapping, is there a necessity for a program as Streets & Trips? I suppose that in a case when one needed the ability to map out a destination with no Internet in sight (my jaded, snarky self asks whether such a place exists!), I suppose Streets & Trips 2009 would come in quite handy then, supposing one happened to have a compute (surely a laptop) on hand.

Barring that, one supposes, the good old paper map would be the fall back. Remember those?

All joking aside, Streets & Trips 2009 is a fine enough product, but one that seems to be losing the battle for computer-based ""ordinary user"" mapping (the hardcore GIS folks don't even bother with such trifling mapping software). Coupled with a GPS unit, one can perhaps start to see where the usability factor starts ramping up over the usual online mapping providers, but even then, portable GPS units with built-in mapping and turn-by-turn directions are cheap enough to give real competition to Streets & Trips which requires a mobile computer together with all that wire going between it and the GPS unit.

Installing is easy and so is actually using the software. Featuring an intuitive interface with nice buttons, I wish the printed maps could happen without having to also print out a background ""texture"" color and the route line sometimes obscures the names of the streets, but this piece of software is not what I would classify as a must-have. A nice-to-have, sure, but well, it left me a bit lackluster overall.

Now, Google Maps!"
"Microsoft did not learn much from its earlier abortive Vista release.  Windows 8 is a completely new approach to using Windows and it hampers function for desktop users to assist tablet users.  Windows 7 and XP users will be frustrated and often lost.

Microsoft was negligent and typically arrogant in not providing an alternative choice to select a more intuitive Windows 7 like interface option under Windows 8 for desktop users.  If you are so frustrated with Windows 8  that you are ready to reinstall Windows 7 over Windows 8  or return your new computer for a Windows 7 version, a good application that makes Windows 8 a little more usable and makes it operate more like windows 7 is called Classic Shell and is a free download (another ap is Pokki).  Ironically, Windows 7 computers are not any cheaper, although they are being clearance out, because of the high learning curve with Windows 8 and associated preference of desktop users (as apposed to tablet users) for Windows 7.

On the positive side, Windows 8 is more compact and a little faster and a little less buggy than Windows 7 (why it got one more star than one only).

Those that are willing to retrain and start all over learning Windows with Windows 7 and take the time to customize their start menu, may eventually like Windows 8."
Let me start off with I subscribe to at least 15 magazines covering a range of subjects.  Mental Floss is the only magazine that I save and leave out for guests.  The reason I save it is that is a very quick read that can be read while people have a few moments to spare.  The articles are short and don't provide much depth.  However it is enjoyable to read something that requires no brain power to process.  Mental Floss is a great magazine that you can sit down with and read in one sitting.  It even occasionaly brings a smile to your face.  I suggest you give it a chance but don't expect to much.
"My favorite designer magazine. I have been reading Vogue for over 20 years.
Couldn't do without.

Hard for these products to compete with MINT which is free.
"I had not used the Turbotax product for a while, but getting up to speed with this was not tough. And the download was purchased at a great price! And for those who are interested, the download was not difficult once I realized that some Antivirus products like Spy Sweeper and Webroot SecureAnywhereAntiVirus will stop the download from happening. I ended up downloading to a different laptop without the Webroot AntiVirus installed on it-  P.K"
Product works as expected however I will not buy again. Symantecs is now injecting itself in politics and does not support constitutional amendments.
Bought along with their shampoo and lotion for a welcome gift for an oceanfront condo rental and are perfect size and price.
"The computer I installed this on was a 2 year old laptop with 2gb ram and Intel Core 2 Duo processor using Windows XP.  Installation went fine, which is good since I have installed, uninstalled, and re-installed the software 3 times.  The problem I am having with it is when I start my computer nothing is responding.  The cursor works, but I cannot open anything.  Putting the cursor on the little Internet Security icon on the task bar, it either says ""starting"" or ""stopped"".  Either way the computer needs to be restarted.  Usually it would take 3-5 restarts to get the computer working.  Once my computer was working the software was fine, and I think I might actually like it.  I have no idea why this would happen, my computer starts up and runs fine with out PC Tools Internet Security.  Currently I do not have the software on my computer."
"I love this magazine. I doubt I could afford to re-do my rooms like they do, but I love looking at the designs, and have found several locations (listed in the magazine) where I can find different and unique things that I like for my home. Great magazine!"
"This is probably the best there is in language teaching progam. Only a real life teacher can do better.

But again, you will need to invest time to learn the language. While this program is very effective, it is not a miracle."
"The most remarkable thing about Snow Leopard is simply that it can be installed on a Mac running Tiger. You do not need to pay the money to buy the boxed set to upgrade if you never upgraded to Leopard. This means that you can upgrade a Tiger computer to Leopard using this disk. It is up to the user to determine if they have an ethical problem with that; Apple certainly knew that this was possible when they released the software: they understand and use DRM effectively and always have. The fact it is missing here tells me that they are primarily concerned with getting Snow Leopard unto as many computers as possible as fast as possible. I am sure part of that is the desire to have Snow Leopard outperform Windows 7 which debuts in October.

So what do you get with Snow Leopard? The answer is largely performance boosts, although many of those are not really applicable (yet) since few (virtually none) third party applications use the performance gains offered by Snow Leopard. Similar to Windows 7s ability to load share between CPU and GPU, many of the changes in Snow Leopard will take several years for developers to really start to use and write programs for.

Relying on 64-bit architecture through the entire OS, Snow Leopard is essentially an upgrade for the future: as developers write programs that take advantage of the new, higher ceiling, end users like you and I will benefit. For now, most of the performance increases are only applicable to Apple's own software. However, that's not to say these aren't nice or useful, and in some cases very impressive:

1) Opening large photos is faster in preview mode

2) Quicktime uses significantly less CPU on all Macs regardless of generation. Older Macs benefit the most with as much as 40% performance gains.

3) Time Machine backups take about 20% less time

4) Snow Leopard itself installs faster than Leopard

5) Boot times are faster with Snow Leopard by 5-10%; Shut down times are slightly faster as well.

6) File compression is also faster by 10-15%

(These are somewhat simplified. If you want the exact numbers you can find them online: Google ""Snow Leopard Performance"")

Of all of these, the performance increases afforded to older first generation Macbooks are the most significant. Breathing new life into older hardware isn't easy, especially not significant improvements. Snow Leopard manages to do just that and make even slower 1.6ghz MacBooks that much more useful.

Installation itself is a SNAP (did I mention it takes less time than Leopard?). I've already upgraded a MacBook and MacBook Pro, and installation was simple, fast, and easy. I plan to install Snow Leopard on another older Macbook later in the week and will upgrade this review once I have.

The few new visual tweaks are nice, but not the reason to upgrade. Better stacks is useful, as is the quickness of Finder, but overall I don't find myself blown away by the upgrade. This isn't an entirely new OS with a fantastic array of improvements, aside from the welcome and useful performance increases. That said, if you are a power user or just observant, you WILL NOTICE the speed increase, especially in Finder. I used to prefer Google Desktop search on PCs to Finder, but this upgrade has swayed me to prefer Finder.

*****UPDATE September 2nd 2009*****

A few other changes of minor importance but sometimes great usefulness:

1) Air Port now shows all available wireless networks and their relative signal strength, something Windows has done going back to XP, but that for some strange reason has been absent from OSX 10. X until now. Now when you turn on the Air Port you get a drop down to select which wireless signal you want as well as signal strength.

2) The date has been added to the desktop. This isn't that amazing but it is useful.

3) I am LOVING the way stacks work now. They're so much more intuitive to use and navigate, especially the ability to brows through directories directly from the stack itself.

4) Trash has the ability to restore a file to it's original location right from the trash. This is a feature common to Windows that has been very strangely absent from Mac OS. It's nice to see them catch this omission and correct it, but very odd it took this long to do it.

A MAJOR complaint:

1) Seriously, no support for CS3? Why Apple, why? I don't have the grand to drop on the newest version of CS. This is very, very frustrating, and makes me wish I could take back a star and downgrade this to a 4-star review. CS3 is still so widely used that I'm amazed Apple decided not to offer support for it. If you want to continue to receive support for CS3 or don't have the money to upgrade to CS4, this could be a big deal and even a reason not to upgrade.

A Minor complaint:

1) One of my time machine back-ups for a co-workers Mac was seemingly corrupted by the upgrade. Fortunately they didn't have any old data they needed from that backup so I just made a new one with Snow Leopard that mounts just fine, but this is something to be aware of. If you have a critical time machine backup that you cannot afford to lose, I'd suggest making a backup of the entire drive (clone it) using SuperDuper! or something like it.

*****End of update*****

Snow Leopard will grow in usefulness as time passes. As I said earlier, once third party applications start to be written to take advantage of advancements in the OS, the performance overhead will become more and more useful. Expect to wait 6-12 months for that to happen, but in the mean time at least you're enjoying speedier OS performance for an very inexpensive price!"
"Intuit is killing the TurboTax product. On one hand, they appear to be trying to make it entirely idiot proof, which means that non-idiots have to wade through endless screens of non-relevant questions, with an array of often misleading options. On the other hand, Intuit seems to be trying to chip away at the included feature set while attempting to monetize the very features they are removing. This is akin to manufacturers who reduce the size of their candy bar to disguise what is actually a price hike: you pay more for less.

  The product differentiation with a seemingly increasing number of more expensive variations is also irritating.

  I've been using the product so long, as well as Quicken, that I doubt that I will change. It still gets the job done. But Intuit, as a company, is leaving me with the feeling that its only interest is in turning me upside down and shaking me until all the loose change falls out of my pocket. I doubt that Intuit will committ corporate suicide with its attitude, but I really wonder if more people won't look at alternatives.

"I have been a Family Circle readers for years , You can find a good variety of articles. Like the magazine!"
"niece liked it. spotted it at grocery store check-out later, probably easier."
"I have used this product for many years.  They have added new features to this version.  There are tools that allow you to maintain your computer, easily.  This is a good choice for those that are not computer literate.  The system installs and updates easily.  from there it can be pretty much hands off.  It will tell you when something needs to be done.  There is system optimization that will clean up and defrag hard drives.  It can recognize the difference between hard drives and solid state drives (if you are on Window 7 or later) so it handles them appropriately.  Another nice feature is a history screen that lets you know when computer events took place.  i.e. downloads, virus scans, detection of issues, etc.  You can click on an event and see the details of what it recorded.  I have used Norton quite a few years on several computers and have never had a virus issue on any of my computers.  This version does a lot more in total system maintenance and is a good buy."

"Having played almost every game in the Nancy Drew PC series (missing SAW and FIN), I know that each game has a certain atmosphere in it; Some are more dark and murky (Castle Malloy comes to mind), some are very light and whimsical while still being a mystery (Secret of the Old Clock?), and some have a nicely balanced mixture of the two (Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake is a good example). Although I usually like the dark ones the least, something about this game was very gravitational. When I first started it, little did I know that not only I'd actually like it even a little, but I'd write a somewhat decent review on it.

Story: 7.5/10. Orginially, Nancy shows up at Blackmoor Manor, a massive mansion in England, to find out what is wrong with newlywed Linda Penvellyn, who won't show her face or communicate with anyone, with the exception of a few words. Upon Nancy's arrival, weird things start happening fast, and it's clear that there's either a supernatual being in the residency, or someone really doesn't want Nancy there. The Penvellyn family is HUGE, and it was considerably fascinating to uncover more and more history.

Graphics/Setting: 7.5/10. The characters are still robotic at this point in the series, but they're slowly improving. Since you stay indoors the whole time (which was a negative aspect for me), you got to really see the detail in the mansion, but boy is there a lot. The manor makes you feel very small, and it's full of a lot of surprises and secrets waiting to be uncovered.

Characters: 7/10. The characters were considerably good this time around. To name a few, there's the intentionally nice but slightly irritating girl Jane, the hired author, Nigel who's writing a Penvellyn memoir, and Mrs. Drake, a strict and uptight lady. There's also Loulou the parrot, who's helpful and funny, but annoying at times.

Puzzles: 7/10. Even though I had to use a walkthrough for almost all of the puzzles, they still took a long time to get done. They really got you to think, but to the point where you're cranium hurt! I think this game sort of over-did the puzzles because they're soooo many. This isn't called the hardest Nancy Drew game for nothing.

Activities: 5/10. There isn't anything really to do outside of the story progression, which I found very dissapointing. I realize that the point of these games is to sleuth and solve mysteries, but fun activities are a priority in my book, and this game just didn't have any.

Ending: 7/10. Maybe the most simple ending yet in the series. Somewhat surprising as well.

Total: 7.33, rounded to the final score of....

7.5/10.

While I may be a tad biased because I don't usually enjoy the darker games, this game does deserve a purchase for many Nancy Drew PC fans, but I'd go with something else for now."
"Once you download Classic Shell (free) for Windows 8, most of your problems with Windows 8 will disappear. The Classic Shell can be customized for further improvement, but just using it as installed makes Windows 8 as easy as Windows 7, plus you have the touch screen capabilities. The email program will still be poor. However, you can buy Office 2010, which works fine on Windows 8. Most of your other applications will also work just the way they used to work.  Microsoft really screwed up with the Windows 8 interface, and the upcoming Windows 8.1 is not much better.  While not saying it in so many words, a Microsoft spokesperson took 10 minutes to say that users should quit complaining and get used to it. Bottom line, I hated Windows 8 as it came with my new ultrabook. I could barely get it to work where I could do anything productive. With the new shell installed, Win 8 works quite well indeed. If Microsoft had done the shell, I'd give it 5 stars and get used to the new paradigm.  There is also a much more expensive Win 8 shell ($5.00) that you might like better."
"PhotoPlus X2 is a very good photo editor. It is operates in a similar manner to Photoshop in many aspects though it is not as powerful as CS3 or CS4.

PhotoPlus X2 is similar in features and power to Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 Ultimate.  Both programs are more powerful than Photoshop Elements versions 6 or 7.  An additional bonus of PhotoPlus X2 not offered with Paint Shop Pro is compatibility with 3rd party Photoshop plugins.

Pros:

Basic editing such as color adjustment, sharpening, lens filters, cloning etc are easy to find and use.

Photo resizing is excellent - the best that I have seen!  (I am referring to taking a small photo and doubling it in size.  Most programs leave the photo in a fuzzy condition.  PhotoPlus X2 somehow doubles the photos with less fuzziness.)

The lens vignette function is really a nice feature to have.  If you use a polarized filter, often times the sky on one side of the photo will be much darker than the other side.  The lens vignette function largely eliminates this problem.

Cons:

The sharpen slider in the Quickfix studio works in chunks rather than in a linear fashion - 0,50 etc.  You must type in a sharpen amount in the box next to the slider and then sharpen in a linear fashion - 28,29,30,31 etc.  Serif verified this bug in Sept 08.

The makeover studio requires several steps similar to Adobe Photoshop - creation of editing masks.  Paintshop Pro Photo X2 Ultimate thankfully does not require the creation of masks to do makeover tasks.

All in all an excellent photo editor that will generally run quite nicely on older hardware - Pentium 4, 3ghz with 3gb of ram."
"I have been a user and a fan of Norton Antivirus and Security products for over 16 years, ever since the McAfee I was using many computers ago failed to protect the computer I was using back in the early 90's from some rather nasty viruses.
Having to wipe and rebuild your computer's hard drive and operating system is not fun, especially for those of us that are a little technically impaired.
For the record, my computer's have been safe ever since I switched to Norton products.
Norton has been very good about improving their products over the years, the slowdowns of the past have almost been eliminated, and the real-time protection from malicious websites makes this worth every penny.

The 3 computer coverage makes this a great deal if you have young adults or teens in your family, especially if your kids like to use sites like Facebook. Norton was effective in blocking malicious apps that are tempting to Facebook users."
"I purchased Outlook 2007 because Microsoft has now chosen to exclude it from certain versions of Office 2007. Well, it has way less features than my previous Outlook:

 - no animated GIF's
 - no support for Outlook Personal Address Book (PAB)
 - the Outlook Text Editor has been eliminated

And now I find that if you purchase this `stand alone' version of Outlook 2007 the `Themes and Stationary' feature is disabled. It only works in those versions of Outlook 2007 that are bundled with the Office Suite, not this version!

This is NOT AN UPGRADE, it's a DOWNGRADE!"
"Been using H&R Block tax software (Tax Cut) for more years than I can remember.
Used Turbo Tax before that for several years. Finally tried Tax Cut, now H&R Block because my Dad was using it and  the lower cost than Turbo Tax.
It has handled everything for me over the years from K 1 forms to investment forms including cap gains/losses etc.
It has even handled for me with out a hitch a necessitated amended return.
As my forms have gotten more complex over the years I have never had an issue.

Now that being said I have one recommendation:
Even though at this point in time I am very familiar with how this tax program flows I do carefully read each step in the interview and answer each question carefully. This little detail will insure you get the forms and pages you need. If you do miss something you will not get the page you need. You will have to go back and hunt it down. You are better off saying yes to a question you are not sure of. You can always skip the part when you get to it.
This year I may actually use the download function for some financial firms like Fidelity to save me manually keying in all the data. Much easier to verify and be done with it.
Actually this program makes it a joy to do your taxes, if I can say that.
The State part is just as easy because of the carry over from the Federal part.
Push of a button and its e-filed. Love it."
"VideoStudio Pro X6 software is a great product that helps you with all of your video editing needs. Very user friendly.

"I read a number of reviews about installation problems under Win 7. However, it seems to me that those reviews are much reduced after February 2011 or so when Windows 7 Service Pack 1 was released. I installed FTM 2011 after my Win7 SP1 upgrade and had no problems with the installation. I did have to select ""run setup.exe"" from the new media menu that popped up, but other than that everything installed the first time without issues. However, the whole installation did take almost 15 minutes on a new Intel i7-based laptop, a rather long time in this day and age, but it did eventually finish. Also, I was short changed on the 1 month free subscription to ancestry.com. It gave me about 3 weeks instead of at least 4. I suppose their date arithmetic makes sense to someone, but not to me.

I'll update this later after I have some experience with the software."

"Not happy with TT this year. Intuit pulled a price scam on the user. You get less for a higher price. To get what you want, you have to upgrade to Premium. Last year Deluxe worked fine."
"After HERinteractive released their last game, I really thought that they were heading in a great direction.  Then this game came out to become one of my least favorites.

Story-You are visiting a friend of a friend who owns an inn/restaurant.  She says that the reason she invited you over was for you to take some jewels back with you to put into your safe at home.  Before you can take them, however, they are stolen.  Whoo.  Thrills and chills.  This is the story.  Finding stolen jewels.  That's it.  And you never actually find them because during the game Nancy becomes distracted from her task to find another item which hasn't even been stolen!  This item is a will, by the way.

Graphics-They were okay.  Thankfully, HERinteractive didn't try to put this game in black-and-white, but the backgrounds actually seemed worse to me than the others have.  Maybe because I just wasn't enjoying anything else, this seemed bad.  The characters look pretty good, though.  Oh!  But some of the locations you go (Phelps Print Shop, Tubby's Telegram Office, etc.) are just black-and-white snapshots.  Why didn't HER make them good, real locations?!?!

Sound-This is, like, 40's music.  It's not bad, and it definitely goes with the story.

Gameplay-There is one big change in gameplay.  You get to drive around in your car.  You can use the arrow keys or you can lead with the mouse, but you visit almost everywhere by car.  Also, no cell phone (it's 80 years ago, people!) so you have to give up money to use the pay phone to call your dad or Bess and George.  That's another thing.  You have to earn money in this game because you have to pay for stuff.  You have to get a job to earn money.  It's really not that bad, but I thought there were better ways to have let you make money.  First Person and point-and-click features are the same, though.

Fun-No it's not.  It's fun the first time through to figure out who the culprit is, but after that, the only replay value is to play mini golf.  I do replay it sometimes but not to the extent of the other games.

Length-Playing it straight through takes about 9-10 hours.  It took me about a week to finish this game the first time.  It's an OK length, but after the last game I was expecting more.

HERinteractive really regressed in this game.  I have to admit, though, the older fans of Nancy Drew will like this game, and some might find it a good way to start the series, but I think that die-hard fans should get this game only for $10 or cheaper while others should just skip this game for now."
Great dining for parents
"All I really want to do with video is improve raw footage. So things like cropping, adjusting the brightness, stabilizing, and such are what's important to me. I have no interest in 3-D or ""particle effects"" and such. So from that point of view, this program is a bit of overkill.

I read with interest what some reviewers had to say about their tribulations with tech support. CyberLink products have always worked well for me, so I have not contacted tech support.

Overall, I'd say PowerDirector 10 is recommendable, especially at its low price. If you're concerned about tech support for the product, see if what others had to say seems meaningful for you."

"The February 2015 magazine issue of kiplingers personal finance features a money question about a mother who appears to love her daughter dearly. However, she does admire her daughter for championing worker rights in garment workers in poor countries, buys trade coffee while using Pandora and Spotify (page 16). Im going to avoid weighing in on the issue because Im lucky to have bought/ and have the chance to purchase cds, some multiple from certain artists/groups/musicians across different genres while also using Pandora and iheartradio. There is a picture of a couple deeply in love on the next page in the spirit of valentines day and a link on where to go for heart healthy tips in observance of February being American heart month.  Starting on page 60, there are ideas on what a person can reasonably do with one thousand dollars."
"Tiger is by far the best version of OSX available for any mac.  Leopard totally sucks, has less capatability, less security, many unresolved bugs, more screens of death and slower speeds than Tiger.  Tiger, although no windows is rock solid and works very well.  If you bough a mac with Leopard, buy an OSX Tiger disc and insert it before you boot up the mac, you will be much happier and safer."

"I subscribe to several financial magazines, of which ""Money"" is one. I think that ""Money"" is an excellent publication for neophyte investors, as it does provide generally sound information and advice. It is very good at explaining terminology in plain English, which is to be applauded, but investors with more knowledge of investments and financial planning would probably be better off with another magazine, like ""Kiplinger's"", for instance.
""Money"" covers primarily investments in mutual funds, bonds, and stocks, although real estate and retirement planning are also dealt with regularly. I like the investment index feature in the back of the issue: it is honestly the only part of the magazine I routinely use anymore, although I do skim the articles, and read one or two per issue. My chief complaint with the magazine is how formulaic the articles are. It seems like every month there is an article called ""The Best Places To Put Your Money Now"", for instance. Timeliness is a good thing, but the magazine endorses long term investing (as do I) so the last thing I want to be doing is thinking about where to move my money to this month.
Beginning investors: this is an excellent magazine for you, and I say that without reservation. Overall though, ""Money"" is not bad, but if you are already fairly knowledgeable about financial management you can do much better."
"I can't really review this for how it works, it would not load onto our computer at all! I don't know what else to say, hopefully it works for you."
"There are a wide range of reactions to this software, and I think they probably break down along differences in expectation and user experience/sophistication. For an animation package, this is farily straightforward to learn and use, especially if you already have a an understanding of the basic principles of animation. It won't instantly transform you into an artist or an animator.  If you want to do very straightforward things, like make simple cutout animations or animate portions of photos, it shouldn't be too difficult to learn, even for a beginner.

Having played with Anime Studio Pro (which is ~$150), Debut is actually very similar, but with some of the more advanced features unavailable. If you are looking to do professional quality animations, you should look at the Pro version. If you're looking for an inexpensive way to stick your toe in the water of making your own computer animations, Anime Studio Debut fits the bill pretty well."
"September 17, 2017
Was able to uninstall and reinstall.
It has gotten WORSE.
Now Norton Security uses 83%-91% of my CPU. Has completely choked up the computer.

September 14, 2017
I can't uninstall it! It gets stuck on the screen "" preparing to uninstall""
Said it would take two minutes to do so. It is been over 20 minutes!
Norton is like a bad cancer you can't get rid of.
And I'm supposed to trust this incompetent bunch of morons for my computer's security?
***
I can't wait until this subscription expires so I can switch to another app.
I clicked TaskManager to learn that 87% of my CPU is being used on ""Norton security""
What on earth is it doing?
Nothing else can run.
I thought it was temporary.  One evening I decided to let Norton security run all night hoping the CPU gluttony would end. Over 12 hours later and it was still running at over 80% CPU usage.
What PC you can run with  Norton security eating up all it's CPU capacity.
And I am to trust the security of my PC with such an incompetent app?"
"I used to use NAV on all my computers. The last few years though, it has gone done hill more each year. NAV 2008 is no exception. It is more bloated and than ever. Symantec needs to start over from scratch, and put out a real new version. A version that has less bugs, doesn't slow systems down to a crawl, and doesn't require 100's of MB's of disk space. The only reason I don't give it one star is that the program does do a decent job of stopping viruses."
A super piece of software for your computer. It works effortlessly and doesn't take up a lot of the computer resources. I highly recommend this item.
"Don't even have to go to the store to get this!  And who doesn't love a movie?  Great gift card, came within two days."
"I've used Family Tree Maker before, and it was interesting,easy, and entertaining to explore my family tree.  Like a lot of other users,I  found this version to be less-than-wonderful.  there was no reason to update, and I preferred the older version.  Sometimes,software developers feel a need to re-invent the wheel, and that seems to be the case here.

i'm not sure why there is a new version other than to possibly address the release of Windows 8 (I stuck with 7 there too.)

If you are running an older version (if its not TOO old) there is no reason to update. If you have never used it before and end up buying this, you won't know that it is clunky and slow to load."

"H&R Block wanted $300 for a simple personal income tax with 1099s, trying it manually left me with forms all over the table and floor, and erasing holes into the papers. Eventually Turbo-tax Home/Business did the job, but not before considerable aggravation.

Specifically, I wanted to enter mileage for job searches, and the program wouldn't let me. Tried phoning for help, and was notified there was a 45-minute wait-time; alternative was to appeal to a users' group. (No offense intended, but the idea of asking others who may or may not be knowledgeable seems like Turbo-Tax is pawning off their responsibilities to help users to others.) Finally ended up stuffing the mileage into another area - hope I don't get audited. On the plus side, really appreciated TurboTax's ability to immediately make revisions (including on state tax forms), and the ability to e-file the federal forms.

Finally, charging extra to e-file state forms just seems like unjustified chiseling."
"I liked all the options in this software. There were a lot of filters you could use. You could transfer objects in and out and change things you don't like. You can work in layers.

I thought this was very user friendly. Of course I needed some instruction and had to get used to it but overall it was not as difficult as some of the other photo editing programs I have used. I really enjoyed testing out the different features. It's amazing how much you can improve your photographs."
So far it seems to be working but only bee a month.
"There is absolutely no question that these days it is much harder to absolutely find the right security software to meet all of your personal needs. These days, with so many more people falling victim of hacking, and trying to find the right new protection is much harder than met the eye. There are just so many brands of security software that have worked in the past, and unfortunately does not work in the way want to deliver. Norton has been unfortunately one of those brands that used to work so successfully, and unfortunately, they leave more clutter onto the hard drive, without much there to safeguard you in the long run from any damages. Norton's Security Software Deluxe, works fairly well if you have multiple PC's to protect and if you do want a brand that is more of a brand name. Unfortunately, it doesn't really work that well in the long run. You only get one year's worth of protection, and it doesn't hold up for the long run. It can work at first, but later on can clog your PC and prevent you from loading new software, because of Norton's backing up so much for the computer hard disk drive. While it is a good buy if you are wanting it for the short run, there are other brands do much more in the long run, and save you a lot of money in the process. If you want a antivirus that works in the long run, you are better off getting a lesser-known brand like Bitdefender or Vipre, which they both work just as well and some cases better than the major brand names. Still, if you really want one major brande name, than maybe you would want to try Norton.

Price: C+

Convenience & Setup: C 1/2+

"I am not a design pro, I don't have a lot of experience with other software of this type (successfully, at least) but I'm just not that impressed.  Here's why:

1) Installation took over an hour.  It's 4 disks, 4 programs, and 4 long winded serial numbers to enter correctly.  It's a pain.
2) Once installed, this still does not act like a ""suite"".  There are 4 different programs you have to find and learn to use. You can't quickly and easily move between the programs.  Another pain.
3) It's pretty limited.  I'm more familiar with Google's Picassa for manipulating photos, the one thing I do a lot of, as I use photos in blogs and websites.  I find myself still resorting to the free software to accomplish the basics because this software is such a pain to figure out how to use.  I just want to crop, sometimes increase shadows, add a watermark, and reduce the resolution to post them on the net.  That isn't a quick few clicks with this software, and I never have figured out how to add a watermark.
4) My partner has voiced complaints that it has duplicated photos and done some other weird stuff to the computer its installed on, resulting in excessive number of duplicate files.  It automatically wants to snatch up any images, and creates additional work in terms of just getting the job done.

The plus side?  It's kind of fun to play with.  I may create some digital scrapbooks for my granddaughter.  The ""paint"" portion is real limited, and the results are usually far from wonderful, so it's just a 'toy'.  It's almost like a sampler of digital imaging software in a simplistic form.  At least I could figure out some stuff on my own, whereas with the programs pros prefer, I was incapable of doing much of anything.

Who would like this software?  Someone who likes playing with their photos and doing digital scrapbooking or creating material for a traditional scrapbook.  Teens and young moms will probably find it more to their tastes.  For us ""grandma geek"" sorts, it's a bit too complicated for quick & easy use, and too simplistic to devote a lot of time learning to use it.  I'd rate it as ""okay"" but nothing too exciting.  It can do more than Picassa, for example, which is nice, but for the simple tasks of just managing photos and posting them to the internet, it's a bit too bloated.  I don't hate it, and I'll continue playing with it, but I'm not instantly in love either."
"Why spend a TON of money on Office XP PRO when you can have it all for just a little? If you are a student or teacher, look no further, this is for you. This full functioning office suite comes with Word, Excel, Powerpoint and Outlook. It ONLY lacks Microsoft Access, which is a database program mostly used by professionals in that area of work. College students will likely never use it, therefore making this package perfect.

Thanks to Microsoft for keeping in mind college students and teachers and making it more possible for us to own their awesomely productive software for a reasonable price.

Enjoy"
"WinZip has been around for ages.  Throughout the years the program has gained several features which have made it more of a swiss army knife for power users.  Although there are several freeware programs that provide similar functionality, none provide the all inclusive features that Win Zip does."
"In general many health magazines seem to focus on glamour and make you wonder what's wrong with you since you can't be a size 2, work out for 3 hours a day, balance a job, family and whatever else life throws your way.  The magazine comes with several articles a month that focus on looking good, exercise plans, diet tips, stress relief, and a few that promote good mental health.  I like this because its low key and sensible.  This magazine isn't set out to change your life, but enhance what you have and show you a few new ideas."
"I was a bit skeptical on buying this, after reading numerous reviews that said the activation key on their copy was invalid.  I made sure that the seller I used was amazon.com (look through the list), so if there was a problem I would deal directly with them.  They had the lowest price of any of the listed sellers anyway.

I built my new PC several days ago, installed Windows 10 Home 64-bit, used the activation key that came with it and it worked without any problem."
Love these drops!
"Super light and very comfortable. I'm a runner and they lack a bit in arch support, so the soles of my feet are a sore. I'm going to add an insert to try fix the problem."
I use it at night and already see the little lines I had disappearing. My eye area is firming up and very soft. My dark circles are seeming to fade too. I couldn't believe how great this product works!
"This product keeps getting better. We still get our copy of Ernst & Young tax book as a reference, but TurboTax is getting better all the time. We did ours by hand for many years, before converting to doing both by hand and electronically. Last year was the first year we only did it electronically (even just a few years ago, most of the tax software was not adequate). This year, we are using TurboTax again, after reviewing the competition. Some minor improvements in forms being easier to access have made this year's a little better."
this program covers most tax returns and works well
"It's very good for people with simple needs.  But it can get clumsy at times.  If you have complex issues, you will need to hire an attorney.  Most of my assets are owned jointly or they, and many have named beneficiary designations that override a will (e.g. beneficiary election on an IRA).  Everything else passes to my wife anyway.

However, the online living trust tool has the ability to create children sub-trusts.  That is something I have to make sure is 'bulletproof.'  Why?  If my wife and I were to die together, some legal framework needs to be set up so our kids can have a trustee to manage their affairs until they become adults."
Love Taco Bell's Taco Salad.
"This is a great shower cap. I have very long thick hair that I don't want to wash every day, so this is perfect.  It fits my head comfortably and stays in place well.  It does a very good job at keep the water off my hair and even the edges barely get damp.  Overall, It's a very nice shower cap."
"I love Corel Painter 4 Essentials!  I bought it and a Wacom Bamboo Fun Tablet back in 2007 before I purchased an HP laptop in 2008.  As soon as I fired up Painter & the other software which came with the Wacom tablet on my laptop, I fell head-over-heels in love with Painter.  I experienced exactly what some of my artistic friends were talking about in 2002--Painter is absolutely amazing.  It felt a little weird to use with the Wacom pen at first, but it wasn't long before I wondered how I ever got along without them.  From 2007 onward, Painter has proven to be indispensable as well as a joy to use.  It's the real reason I purchased a computer and I enjoy it as much now as the first time I used it.  I use it as a complement to Photoshop & Paint Shop Pro as well as creating artwork from a scanned drawing or sketch.  Besides the different brushes and media available in Painter, I also enjoy the fact that Painter automatically creates a duplicate of whatever you're working on after you ""Save As"" as well as turning photographs into artwork.  I don't get into the ""Painter versus Photoshop"" argument because it's a non-issue.  Both are great at what they do and are a joy to use together.  Most of all, Painter 4 was very reasonably priced and I had no problems with it whatsoever.  A clean interface that's easy to understand and use plus the fact that Painter pays for itself.

As I said in my Paint Shop Pro review, the one thing I would wish for in future iterations would be a natural drawing interface similar to Autodesk Sketchbook or MyPaint (an open-source drawing program).  Otherwise, Corel Painter 4 Essentials gets the highest recommendation from me."
"We've been a customer of Nolo Press for quite a long time. Their books are a terrific value - good legal information for the do-it-yourselfer. Whether you're actually doing something or just looking for information, Nolo is a great go-to for many kinds of legal expertise. Please do note that this, like most things legal, may not apply to your state - check to make sure it is valid.

On to Willmaker. We have a somewhat simple need - just need to have something in place to avoid the legal tussles if we were to pass on. There's a peace of mind in knowing that you can speak for yourself after you've left this world and don't want your kids or heirs to have to untangle things or let the state have to do it.

There have been a number of additions to WillMaker since we last set up our wills - notably the digital asset department, which is (we think) essential in this new age. Social accounts, online banking and online anything are really something new to think about and passing control legally to someone is really important. At a minimum, it makes people who will be carrying out your will aware of these things and ensure control over them. One of the biggest problems in death is having someone with appropriate authority and companies holding your ""stuff"" need that legal establishment to provide access and control to someone other than yourself. I see this as becoming more and more important.

WillMaker lets you speak for yourself in your absence, with healthcare directives, funeral and burial desires, cremation, etc. so that it's all very clear. Check the Nolo web site for a complete listing of forms and the processes includced. I especially like the Letter to Survivors - letting your relatives and significant people know exactly why your desires were laid out they way they are and perhaps explain the reasoning. I have a set of specifics and why, and this is a really good answer for me to be able to do this.

You can read about all the product specifics at Nolo Press or in the product descriptions, but as with everything I've ever gotten from Nolo, it's concise and complete. The price is right too, especially considering how much in lawyer fees you will avoid by doing this simple process yourself. And the cost of NOT doing a will would be immense to your survivors and/or heirs. Of course, as they say, it's no substitute for legal advice and if your estate is complex, perhaps a lawyer is in order, but for probably a large majority of us, this is just what the barrister ordered. (sorry for that!) Anyway, we've used WillMaker for a number of years and this was a welcome upgrade and though I did receive this as part of the Vine Program, I would easily have paid for this upgrade - it's completely worth the peace of mind it gives."

"While I have yet to need this for its intended purpose, it has provided me peace of mind when traveling with my laptop. I can testify that after installing, I have noticed absolutely no decrease in system performance and have run into no conflicts. If only it came with a ""Norton Security System"" sticker like home security systems..."
"This is the latest in a long string of Norton computer protection software I've owned over the year (It's usually cheaper to buy new than to renew your subscription with Norton). Norton is a little pushy on how safe it wants you to be, but that's OK.

This one allows me it install on up to 5 devices, including cell phones and pads. The time remaining on any subsequent installation starts from the date of the FIRST installation..."
"I have used both more complex and less complex software. And, I always return to Pinnacle Studio. For those who have used similar software in the past, it is fairly intuitive and one isn't paying for a truckload of ""bells and whistles"" one will never use. I really like that aspect. However, I did get a different perspective when my brother attempted to use it. He tinkered with it for about an hour and walked away frustrated. He said that he wished it were more friendly to the new user. Looking at this through his eyes, I can see that. He ultimately purchased&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cyberlink-PowerDirector-15-Ultra/dp/B01LEZN03I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cyberlink PowerDirector 15 Ultra</a>&nbsp;for his home computer and has had tremendous luck (and it does have a bunch of really cool features that I enjoyed playing with).

So, I think it may be about your level of familiarity. For me, Pinnacle Studio has always been a favorite; however, for the new-user, maybe PowerDirector is best for a quick start!"
great gift and the tin is cool.
"As a CPA I have been using H&R Blocks Deluxe Tax software for at least 15 years. While theyve actually cut back some of the features I found VERY helpful, I find it more user-friendly that Turbo Tax  the only other personal tax software out there. Sand its always cheaper and Amazon always has the best price the list week of the year or  often on January 2nd.

The feature I miss most is the Compare to Prior Year report (which was deleted about four years ago when HRB changed name of their tax software from Tax Cut to HRB at Home. This was a handy way to see if you missed anything from prior year or why your estimate this year was off. I sure wish theyd bring it back.

The other factor I want to alert you to (as it applies to both HRB and Turbo Tax) is the state tax program. If you live and work in the same state or there is NO STATE Income Tax in either your home or work stare, you can skip this comment. However if you have the above situation (or have rental real estate in other than your home state), you will need TWO State tax programs. HRB gives you ONE state included in the program package. EACH additional state module  which you can only buy and download from HRB  costs $39.95 plus tax. Since the Deluxe + State shouldnt cost you more than $34.95 (probably less) you are paying more for that second (or God forbi9d third state) than for your original Fed + State return. This is very common issue for those living in NY, NJ, PA, and CT. I wish that HRB would offer a  Deluxe + StateS for maybe $10-$15 more and allow up to  say  three states. But, since  like airlines  they can make more by charging for each addition extra  they probably wont
One other thing.  With the deluxe you get up to 5 free Federal e-files. But you get NO free State e-filing. That costs about another $15.00. This is really annoying. But know the cost going in.

So I would give the software five stars but am withholding one star because of the high cost of extra state modules and lack of the simple compare with last year report.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

"Upon opening this new version of Norton Security I was surprised to see that even though it's a boxed product, there's no installation disc in there, just a card with a product key. You actually still have to download all the files to install (so why not just sell it as a digital download instead of assembling and shipping out boxes?). Unlike other reviewers I didn't have any problems with the installation, although I was amused right off the bat that the first thing it tried to do was uninstall AVG. It's true that you shouldn't run more than one anti-virus at a time, but rather than warning about that and offering to turn off your other anti-virus tool, it instead tries to uninstall it, which is pretty intrusive.

The main selling point on this edition of Norton Security is that it's compatible across a range of operating systems  Windows, Mac, and even mobile devices - and one instance covers up to 10 devices, so everything on your home network is protected instead of having to buy the software multiple times. Once it was installed I actually liked the sleek, minimalistic design that isn't overwhelming with options and features on the main window, and I found everything easy to navigate through.

Despite the nice design, the problems started popping up immediately as I began searching through the features. The software comes with 25GB of free online storage, with an option to buy more space. I clicked the more storage button and it tried to open a webpage by using my word processor, instead of my web browser. Obviously there are some programming issues here.

The software lets you setup automatic backups of folders to run regularly so you don't lose your data in the event of a problem with your computer. Unfortunately it's not super user friendly for selecting specific files and folders to back up, as that takes quite a few extra steps, and instead it wants to select for you the most commonly backed up file types (media files in My Documents, email addresses, etc.). Backup is also very, very slow. After 2 hours of still saying 0% copied with only a handful of text and image files selected I finally gave up and canceled.

I opened up Google Chrome to see if there was any troubleshooting tips available and I discover Norton has automatically installed a web browser extension without asking my permission  and that unwanted extension completely nerfs the Facebook interface, making the search bar float all over the screen while scrolling down. After uninstalling the extension, an add continuously pops up throughout the day at the bottom-right corner of my computer screen telling me to re-install the Norton toolbar in Chrome. At this point I'd had enough and started uninstalling.

On the upside, the Norton quick scan is actually quick - about 15 minutes and done, and unlike some other pay anti-virus tools I've used, it doesn't significantly slow down my computer or interfere with gaming. But considering all the problems with the program  and the fact that you have to re-buy it after 365 days  I'm left wondering why on Earth I'd pay for this instead of just using any of the free anti-virus tools readily available online that actually work and don't try to continuously install unnecessary tools I don't want."
"This is absolutely horrible.

1) They have stripped out features that used to exist, at all levels, in order to force you into buying a higher level
2) The software makes frequent and gross errors in dealing with MLPs
3) There are bugs in the software, resulting in incorrect calculations
4) It crashes
5) There is no support.
6) Just to repeat - THERE IS NO SUPPORT - other than groupies who may / may not know what they are talking about"
Great backup software. No problems. Works with Windows 10 64 bit fine.
"As with other Savannah bee products, this feels good, smells delicious in the shower.  Hard to find but really helps with dry skin."
"I was a long-time Eset user but tempted away by Kaspersky because of its performance in the av-comparatives trials ([...])  After a year of evaluation I can report that I've switched back to Eset's NOD32 products.  I was even offered a free one-year license for three PCs, but instead chose to sign up with Eset again.  Here's why.

I have occasion to fix PCs from time to time, and part of that is scrubbing hard drives and such.  Kasperksy actually failed to protect my test bench machine from trojan infections on a USB-attached hard drive.  I was greatly disappointed; more so, when I downloaded NOD32 and found existing infections on the Kaspersky-protected machine.  Unacceptable.

However, that could be forgiven in a greater context, as not every AV product catches all infections.  I've used Kaspersky, Alwil, McAfee, Norton/Symantec, AVG, Eset, and Microsoft on many machines, and all have blind spots.  However, with Kaspersky, you're also buying network security, and my primary issue with that is it was too complicated to configure properly.  I never had solid feedback as to the efficacy or even correctness of my configurations, and I have configured iptables in anger, so this was bizarre.  Furthermore, Kaspersky was a major disaster with logon scanning and delays.  It was too painful to use.

In the end, even a price of zero would not allow me to continue with the product.  I went back to Eset, and now I hardly know it's there... and that's exactly what you want from an AV product.

"I've been using Norton for about 10 or 11 years now and I haven't had a virus in all that time. It seems to get easier to use every year, but I'm generally familiar with their format, even though it does change a bit from year to year. I really like this new version and the capability to cover 5 devices. I'm pretty careful online and don't think I operate in a high risk way, but I know it's possible to get a virus even with a virus protection plan.  I like Norton because it seems to be a pretty good watchdog for my computer. That said, it does slow my computer down a little, but  I don't do any online gaming so it's not really a big deal for me. it has also caught some malware and viruses that I would have missed without it and that is why I keep going back to it.  I've had a lot of experience dealing with people who define themselves as computer illiterate and defer to their husband or their children for anything on the computer and  strongly recommend it for people who can't or won't do anything on their own to optimize their PC's performance. And if you have a problem and need help customer support is excellent.

My one complaint is the renewal price being so much more than just buying it new again, so every year I just uninstall and reboot and install anew. Think how happy you'd be if you could do that with your cable plan."
nice for my tween Granddaughter
Works as expected
ok
"great smell, and work better than the bad stuff. go figure."
have used for years. This year they added he ability to download investments and have TT calculate the gains and losses.  Worth every penny.
"i renew it every year for a long time now, tried alot of others and their was always issues doing simple things even for a computer orientated person. haven't tried them all, never had a virus either. just shop around on amazon and watch the price, it can fluctuate greatly"
too bad this  is discontinued
Easy to use.....
Good magazine.
"I don't feel the need to dive into depth in this review, as there are so many other good ones here. As always, Family Tree Maker is a solid product and worth the investment. The feature suite is rich and it gets the job done nicely. Where my real complaint lies is the map. This has been a feature that's been in the last few iterations of FTM and, while I love the idea, the implementation drives me bonkers.

The idea behind the mapping feature is that you can attach people and events to actual locations on a map. It's great for setting up to-do lists, getting a visual look at your family history, and so on. The problem, however, is with formatting. I have yet to figure out what it insists locations be entered as they are. For instance, I have ancestors buried in a cemetery in ""Baileyville"" TX. This is, of course, how I've entered them. FTM, however, doesn't like ""Baileyville, TX"" and gives me a ""?"" beside any entries. Basically, it can't find ""Baileyville"" in its database. And yet, on the map view, it drops the pin right on--you guessed it--Baileyville, TX! So it can't find Baileyville, TX in its database, but seems to find it just fine on the map. Go figure. At others times, it will insist on a County for a location and, even when I duly enter it in, will still kick it back as being somehow wrong. There really seems to be no rhyme or reason to when a location will be kicked back as unrecognized. This is sad, too, because the feature is really nice when it works. It's helped me clear up some sloppy editing (like when I once entered ""Grimes Co, TX (Last name was spelled <edited>.  Age was given as 64.  Occupation listed as farmer.  Real estate value listed as $47,000.)"" for a location!)

Perhaps I shouldn't be so harsh, but this is a feature that's advertised prominently and has been around for years. There are ways around these issues, but none of them feel reliable to me (and ancestry software should be reliable above anything). If they could fix these map problems, I'd give it 5 stars in a minute. Until then, however, I'm keeping the pressure on.

(Long story short, great software, but the mapping piece can still be annoyingly inconsistent)"
"This Norton Anti-Theft package is a good idea on the surface but the implementation leaves much room for improvement. I have had two Kindle Fires go missing (most likely left at doctor office waiting rooms) and have not recovered either one, so I know how frustrating it can be to have a valuable device get stolen. While I generally like Norton products, this program added little over the free solutions that are available to justify the expense of this package.

The package actually sends you the Norton site for the install and is a somewhat cumbersome process that requires you to set up an account if you don't already have one. I bailed out once it became obvious that it was going to be more troublesome.

"The new 2009 Mac Pros have no firewire 400 ports, and a number of the add-in cards in the market work poorly in a Mac. This card, however, seems to work just fine. It installs in about a second and needs no drivers. Both ports become immediately available.

I've been testing mine with an iSight camera and a Lexar compactflash card reader. Given an ultra II compact flash card rated to ""minimum 9MB/second,"" I was able to copy a 1.90GB file at a pace of 9.2 MB/second. This is only about 20% the theoretical speed of a firewire 400 port, but I don't have any higher speed firewire device handy on which to apply tougher testing.

Note that the card does not support Target Disk Mode on the Mac."

"I received this product to test and review. I was very excited to try Sage 50 (Peachtree) but quickly discovered that this had limited use for me because it is not Windows 10 compatible and I already purchased a new computer and upgraded to Windows 10 this year. Disappointing because this is the 2016 version of Sage 50 and thought they would have addressed the Windows 10 issue..

However, I installed it on an old laptop and thus I have some very limited things to say about this software:

1. Easy to install regardless if it's a single laptop or network
2. Interface is very clean and easy to use though in my opnion, it is geared toward those with accounting experience/background"
good product I have used it for 7 years
"My bottom line on this program is that is a winner when it comes to the average person needing to edit images.  It is more affordable than Photoshop Elements, and much, much more affordable than full power Photoshop.  I understand that Photoshop is the standard, but Paintshop Pro is pretty doggone powerful, and it's less money.  My install of this program onto a 64bit machine, running Windows 7 Professional was smooth and without any headaches.  The interface is pretty consistent with previous versions, this version is no real overhaul, but an enhancement.  The learning curve is also easier that stepping up to Photoshop.

One final thought, unlike Photoshop, when you buy this, it's yours.  Adobe's increasing Byzantine security and connectivity demands and expensive upgrades are a burden unless you are a professional and you can write the cost.  If you are looking for a in home program, buy this instead."

"I do not why the others had these problems with Windows XP. I have run this program since it came out 2001? Except for the danger of attack by viruses, I have had no trouble as long as enough RAM is installed. A minimum of 500-750 is essential. With the addition of antivirus software and service pack 2, I feel fairly secure."

"I am not going to beat around the bush here.  Windows 8 is the worst operating system I have ever had the misfortune of working with.  This is coming from someone that has used Windows ME and Vista.  I don't know what Microsoft was thinking in releasing OS or if they were even thinking at all. But apparently they only care about the ""next big thing"", and care nothing about people who actually use their software.  They also apparently don't have a QA department because I find it very hard to believe that any sane person would sign off on an OS with so many usability problems and bugs.  I don't know where to begin but to get started I will just take excerpts from an opinion I wrote about Windows 8 on another website and go from there.

Windows 8 was clearly designed for a touchscreen, but not every one wants touchscreen, and not every windows application is compatible with touch screen. Users should not be forced to buy a computer that has touch screen just so they can use Windows 8. Windows 8 might work well on a tablet or phone, but it sucks as a desktop OS however Microsoft seems hell bent on shoving touch screen down our throats.  If people wanted a tablet or a phone, then guess what?  They would BUY a tablet or a phone.  Why try to force an OS designed for tablets or phones onto a desktop or laptop?

To my surprise Windows 7 ended up being a pretty good OS and I use it at work and many people also like Windows 7. However Microsoft had to go and ASSUME (like they always do) that we all want touch screen now and remove everything that worked so well in previous OS's.  i.e. the start button.  Pressing the windows key on Windows 8 will not bring up the start menu, but instead it will bring you to a poorly designed screen with stupid tiles every where making finding what you want a tedious task.  They hid everything from you and many times you have to search the web to get help to find what you are looking for.

Touch screen is stupid for a desktop or laptop computer. The tiles, metro UI, or whatever you call it is idiotic and makes working in the OS an absolute nightmare. I couldn't care less about stupid teeny bopper Facebook or other social media crap. I just want to do what I need to do on the computer and not have to go through menu after menu of Nickelodeon type tiles just do a simple task. This OS isn't about productivity, its about pretty colors, and Facebook status updates. Microsoft seemed to forget people actually do WORK on their computers.  For example I VPN to my work network to work from home occasionally and I need remote desktop connection to connect to the many servers I use at work.  However because Windows 8 is so poorly designed, instead of just double clicking the mstsc application to open a new window, now double clicking it just brings up the existing connection, meaning I have to again search for the mstsc app, right click it and then click open new connection.  This takes a lot of time especially when I'm working on 3, 4, or 5 servers at the same time.  Even stuff like configuring a printer or getting into the control panel is an exercise in hair pulling frustration.  Switching between windows which what 99.999% of people who actually do WORK on a laptop do, is extremely cumbersome basically eliminating any hope of productivity.  Heck even turning the damn thing off, or logging a user off is made unnecessarily complicated. Who ever designed this OS or thought people would actually like this mess needs to be fired and banned from ever designing an OS again.

Luckily the only computer in my household that had this turd of an operating system was my son's laptop.  But low and behold Windows 8 crashed for the 2nd time and now won't let me back in thanks to the endless ""We are automatically repairing your PC"". loop.  The automatic repair is just as useful as Window's assistant in previous operating systems.  Now I can't get into Windows at all so all the stuff is now gone.  Luckily I had the foresight not to put any important files on this computer so I really don't lose anything.  I'm writing this review on my Windows XP laptop I bought nearly 6 years ago, and other than a few hardware issues, the operating system itself has been pretty solid, which is much more than I can say about Windows 8.  Today I'm going to install Windows XP on my son's laptop and be done with it.  I should have done this as soon as my son got this laptop and I wouldn't be going through this today.

Windows 8 is the reason I will never buy another laptop unless it comes with Windows 7. In addition, I will never even consider purchasing a Windows Tablet or a Windows phone. Words simply can't express how much I hate, loathe, despise, detest, abhor this operating system.  I can't wait to get it off my son's laptop and out of my life for good."
"I use this daily , love the extra information"
Gift....they liked it.  :-)
This product is MUCH improved over previous versions.  It just works without getting in the way.  Check my review history because with prior versions I was no fan.  Now I am.
"The packaging suggests that it is possible to upgrade to Windows 8 Pro. It is not, unless you happen to have the appropriate ISO file in hand. Otherwise, your only choice is Windows 8.1 Pro. I tried every trick in the book, including a LONG phone call to Microsoft. You can easily start the process, but you will always reach a point where an installer program tells you that it could not make an internet connection.

This matters, because it is possible to save your installed programs and personal settings as you upgrade from Windows 7 Professional to Windows 8 Pro. It is also possible to save these two items as you upgrade from Windows 8 Pro to Windows 8.1 Pro. However, it is not possible to save these two items as you upgrade directly from Windows 7 Professional to Windows 8.1 Pro. I found a Microsoft web page that spells all this out."

"Nuance got it right with Dragon 4. I have used Dragon on my PC for more than 12 years and had been one of its greatest boosters. The initial release of Dragon 3  for Mountain Lion  was quirky, but Nuance improved it with subsequent upgrades.

I have installed version 4 (4.0.2). 4.0.2 works great with the latest upgraded version of new Pages. I never tried Word on my Mac. I am a great fan of WordPerfect which I use on my PC. This comment was dictated with Dragon 4.  I think the major problem was the initial release of version 3  was that it was released very shortly after the initial release of Mountain Lion.  Apple subsequently released interim upgrades for Mountain Lion & Nuance  eventually caught up with it.

Nuance  did not release version 4  until almost 6 months after Mavericks was released.  There were subsequent upgrades of Mavericks  which eliminated some of its quirks.  For version 4,  Nuance waited until they could get it right.

l have used Dragon for more than 12 years on my PC and other software made by Nuance. The initial release of Dragon 3 for Mac was quirky on Mountain Lion but Nuance improved it with upgrades for that version. Version 4 was apparently designed to work with Mavericks and it works very well for me."
"Perfect gift.  I liked that there are 3- $10 in the packs, I was able to give more away that way."
The receiver loved this.  Much better than a plain gift card in an envelope.
"I've owned Mac's since the original 128K Mac and Microsoft Products have always had integration issues in the Mac world.  This version of Office is no exception.  I work a lot on PC's at work, so I'm used to that environment.  In the Mac version of Office, menus are not where you think they might be.  Some of the most useful ones in Word and Excel are still part of the Mac menu bar, though there is another Excel or Work menu bar.  Many of the formatting controls are on a separate window and in headings you would not expect.  So, here's hoping (once again) that someday Microsoft creates a truly integrated Mac Office."
"The software downloaded from this CD (purchased from Amazon) onto my (one year old) Mac Laptop could not be opened or used without a ""DSA Key"", whatever that is.  Intuit does not offer a clue.  Blocked and frustrated, I returned the product to Amazon.

Love eating at Logan's! Great gift idea as well.
"Intuit is far from one of my favorite companies. I've written extensively about the issues with their&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/QuickBooks-Premier-Nonprofit/dp/B005FIWU28/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">QuickBooks Premier Nonprofit</a>&nbsp;software which STILL cannot print meaningful donor letters (pretty much an essential function of every non-profit that I know of). Intuit seems to follow a 90/10 principle with 90% of their budget going to graphic designers endlessly rehashing the aesthetics of the software and 10% for making meaningful improvements.

Another major complaint I have with Intuit is that they leverage ads into their software. Quicken will encourage you to bank with Chase, open mortgages through QuickenLoans, etc. I pay full price for software so that I DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT ADS. Intuit force feeds them to you. Simply unacceptable in my opinion when paying full price for a piece of software.

If you are coming to Quicken fresh, don't hesitate to purchase a copy. It is a viable financial management software that despite its quirks and frustrations, largely does a find job of managing MOST people's money. If you've already got a copy of Quicken that you're happy with KEEP IT. Upgrade only when absolutely necessary (when the ability to automatically download transactions from your bank expires).

The bottom line is that every year Quicken messes about with the layout of the GUI (Graphic User Interface). Some changes you may like, others you may not. I've found they do about much harm as good. They have done a few things to make the software a bit more user friendly and customizable, but there are still glaring gaps that haven't been addressed for many years. If you check the Intuit user forums you can see what I'm talking about.

A few examples:

1) Quicken cannot track 401k loans, even if you have direct update set up with your brokerage. It creates a constant cash balance issue that is impossible to sort out.

2) Mortgage balance tracking is cumbersome at best.

3) Partial ownership of assets is virtually impossible (for example if you are part owner of a rental property and want to track your cost basis--you must manually adjust everything to your ownership percentage and then enter it)

Admittedly these examples will not apply to most users. However, when product as the word PREMIER in it's title, and costs nearly a hundred bucks, I think it's fair to expect it to have accommodate sophisticated financial situations.

Another issue I have with Quicken is that it REGULARLY crashes after completing a one-step update. I have to go into task manager and manually kill the QB.exe program and then restart to get things working again. The error report that QBs generates is meaningless, and no one at Intuit is capable of diagnosing it. They blame the error on my computer (laughable considering I run a host of other far more demanding programs flawlessly) and suggest re-installing, something I've tried multiple times with no success. Their customer support is terrible. Be prepared to be told it is your computer at issue or run in circles through their e-maul support. As a person with a high level of tech experience, I can tell you these guys really are clueless.

In summary:

Skip this purchase unless you don't already own a financial management software. If you have a copy of Quicken that works for you, SKIP THE UPGRADE until you absolutely must. Understand that the software is buggy, and that support is useless. Also understand that the software comes with a healthy dose of ads."
"We have 2 of these as our backbone for our 70 machine office. They are a bit noisy, but their performance is perfect.

Main points:
-Does not need to be a ""managed"" switch.
-Easy plug and go.
-Light enough to put into a U1 rack spot with just the from brackets.
-Uses standard UNC power cable.
-Fans make a little noise. Good enough to hide in a room, but not in an open space next to office workers."
"I've had Norton products on my computers for over 10 years. And for most of those 10 years have experienced no problems whatsoever. Since the 2003 and 2004 version of this software program I have experienced SEVERE slowing down of my computer, hanging up of my computer when trying to shut it down, and prolonged start up times ALL of which were cured when I took this bloated software off my computer.

I'm not a software designer or a computer expert but am reasonably adept and skilled on the computer and can for the most part fix nearly every problem I encounter. I don't understand exactly WHY removing Norton solved my problems but I can tell you this: My computer has NEVER run so well and with so few problems. No crashes, no hanging up on shut down or start up, and lightening quick responsiveness once again.

The problems caused by this Norton program flummoxed until I finally isolated Norton as the culprit. I googled my multitude of problems and found that several people were have the same sorts of problems and identified Norton as the root cause. At first I rejected out of hand that a company as legendary and well regarded as Norton could be at the root of my problems, but decided out of frustration to delete the program and see how it impacted the multiple problems I was having.

Low and behold my problems miraculously vanished! I couldn't believe it! My daughter who had problems on start up worse than mine balked too at removing this program from her laptop but also discovered that the removal of Norton solved HER problems as well.

This new product has dropped the antispam and ad blocking functionality available in previous versions. You do have the opportunity, however, to buy these separately should you be so foolish.  The new interface, to my way of thinking, is not as good as prior versions.  Installation itself can be an adventure in frustration as it was for me.  Worse, taking the damn thing off presents unique problems as well.

I told one of my friends what I'd discovered and he too deleted the program only to see all of his multiple problems disappear! He told me that he simply couldn't believe how good his computer was once again functioning. My uncle called me yesterday. He resisted taking Norton off his computer because he thought I was exaggerating the problems caused by Norton. He finally took Norton off when another of his friends told him the same thing. He told me he should have acted sooner thereby saving him all sorts of problems and heartaches.

I've replaced Norton System Works with Trend Micro's PC-Cillin and Zone Alarm both of which are highly regarded.  Other highly regarded antivirus programs that are NOT resource hogs and do not cause the multitude of problems caused by this bloated pig of a software program are AVG antivirus from Grissoft and Avast! antivirus - both work great.

If you are having unexplained problems with your computer that your anti-virus program and spyware programs are not solving and if you have this bloated pig of a program on your computer then you need to delete it.

Norton has been getting these reports on their software for over three years and refuses to correct the problem. It is hard to imagine what is going through their heads. These fools figure they can sell junk software forever. WRONG!! They are destroying their franchise. I will not put ANY Symantec software on my computer.  They are quirky, resource hogging, intrusive garbage which are nearly impossible to completely uninstall from your computer.  Don't forget:  the best way to install any Norton product is to skip it altogether.

BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! BEWARE!! You have been warned."
"I have been into guns and knives and other weapons all my life.  Even though I am not a big outdoor fishing and hunting enthusiast; nevertheless, I subscribed recently to Outdoor Life Magazine for a super bargain price because they also have articles on guns, knives and other equipment.  I found this magazine to have several interesting and informative articles.

For example this issue (June/July 2015) had a fantastic article on shooting 17 new rifles and shotguns, as well as the hottest new close-range, hunting, and precision riflescopes.

If you are an outdoor activity person, who loves fishing, hunting, camping and other outdoor things to do, you should check out this magazine.  I found it to be an interesting and informative read.

"I guess history really does repeat itself.  For the past ten years or so, all of Microsoft's ""new products"" look and act very similar to the previous version to the point where one has to wonder why we bother upgrading.

So it is with VISTA Ultimate.  It does have a bit of a slick new look and adding ""gadgets"" on the side is a nice, friendly touch - but that hardly would qualify this as a five-year-in-the-making creation.  As Windows really operates in the background, it means that you don't notice Vista anymore than you noticed the earlier versions.  Startup looks a bit different and the START button, or so I have been told, is now called, ""The Pearl"" but you don't need a tutorial to figure anything out.  That is OK but the fact that there are no visible improvements is a bit of a set-back.

There is, however, a big problem that I faced.  Several products are not Vista ready even though they are new on the market.  Drivers have been promised so it is just a matter of waiting but I am a long-time McAfee user and they said their products are not compatible to Vista 64 bit.  OK.  I went to Microsoft for Live and their product is only compatible with Vista 32 bit.  Excuse me but how on earth can you sell a product that is not ready to provide users with internet security?  Or, better still, how can you not create your own internet security system for the product you sell?  Strange.

So, as we will all have Vista as it will be loaded on all future machines, you'll use it and, once some of the kinks are ironed out, you probably won't even notice it.  Until then . . ."
"I'm a VERY long-time user of WinZip and purchased licenses in the past so figured it was time for an upgrade. There's much to like with this version. If you use MS Office, you'll find the new interface very familiar. It took me a little getting used to (I still often have to look around to remember how to ""extract"" my files) but overall it's very clean and easy to use. I like the new features for unzipping to common directories (I have a number that I routinely am extracting files to) and there's a myriad of features that you may or may not use, like password-protecting zips, creating backups, etc. It's a tad harder to justify paying for this when there are good open source solutions out there now like 7-Zip, not to mention the built-in handling of modern OSes. I work with zips on a nearly everyday basis (as well as other archive formats) so this is definitely a product well worth having. If you are a more casual user, you'll want to decide whether it's worth the cost."
"I have used H&R Block (or Tax Cut) for over 10 years.  I got the disk this time and it has installed and updated with no issues.  I am using a Win 7 machine.  I have not finished a return yet (I'm still waiting for many IRS forms, including my W-2), but so far the product looks and feels like the 2012 program, which worked fine."
Great product from a great seller!!
"I had some apprehension about getting this particular virus protection software as I had some bad experience with the 2009 version. However, I have to say that I was a lot more impressed with this than I was ever with 2009. Bitdefender 2009 brought me nothing but heartache and brought my computer down because of different incompatibility issues with other software.

The installation of 2010 was very easy and it had even let me keep using my 2009 key if I wanted to. I had installed this on three different Operating Systems: two running Windows 7 and one running Windows XP. The first Windows 7 installation did encounter some problems but I was able to let it do a scan of my computer and then re-installed and it worked fine. The Windows XP one had the 2009 version on it and it went very fast without any problems. I had found that after installing 2010 on the Windows XP, that I had a lot less bugs than before. However, since my computer was just bogged down with too much applications and files on it, I did a new install of Windows 7. With the newest Windows 7, I installed 2010 and again, no problems whatsoever. It was smooth and ran very fast. In fact, I barely notice the antivirus running.

The backup is very easy to setup. Just note that the online backup is only for a limited amount of time. I believe it is for one year. All of the other features work great and the new look is so much better than before. It's less bulky and more attractive.

Overall, I am happy with this product and has provided a lot less hassle for me than last year's version. If you are apprehensive about getting this because of issues with 2009, rest assured it is a great improvement."
love love love
Great product. However it slowed down my pc with winVista sith 4gb RAM but worked well with my win7 computers.
"Finding a ""natural"" shampoo that isn't disappointing is a challenge. They usually fail to lather and leave hair feeling dry or dull. This shampoo lathers just enough and as someone with straight, somewhat thin hair, I've been pleased with the way this shampoo really does smooth the hair but without weighing it down."
"QuickBooks Premier 2013 is a powerful program that does give us the ability to handle all of our financial related activity in one place. That being said, we started on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/QuickBooks-Pro-2007-Small-Business-Financial-Software-OLD-VERSION/dp/B000HBVVG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">QuickBooks Pro 2007 Small Business Financial Software [OLD VERSION</a>] and never felt the need to upgrade until my wife's work laptop crashed and had to be rebuilt from scratch. Fortunately I had backed up the Intuit QuickBooks data files when the PC first started having issues, unfortunately we had long since misplaced the old install disc and codes, so was happy when the Vine Program offered this version. Here are my observations from an upgrade perspective:

Pros -
+ Powerful; the program does provide all of the accounting, payroll, budgeting, and, most importantly for us, invoicing tools we need
+ Easy Upgrade; program walked through the upgrade process as part of the install, came up with all of our recovered data, customer info, and old invoices intact

Misc -
* Interface; the new interface is fairly easy to navigate and is more or less logically laid-out, but really different from the older versions and is not possible to change

Cons -
- Installation; took almost two hours to fully install and register the program
- Color Scheme; was wondering why there were so many complaints from other reviewers, but they really are quite hard to use on my wife's laptop

As noted above, this package will do everything needed from an accounting perspective that we could ask for but it is taking some time to get used to the new look and feel.

Recommended, with the caveat that if you are coming from an older version there will likely be an adjustment period.

Ok but not great.
I have enjoyed READERS DIGEST.  It continues to be relative and informational.
I am a fairly well educated person who is handy around the house.  It took a 25 minute call with Microsoft customer support to get the box open.  Customer support had to pull up a diagram and walk me through 18 steps.
Great Christmas gift.
"I have a pretty decent background with high end photo editing suites and CAD software and I have a pretty big tolerance for lag times.  However this Corel Draw package is so slow to load I rarely use it.  The feature set?  Great.  The price?  A good value for what you get.  The load time?  Two minutes + on a fairly modern Quad core system running Win7.  I just couldn't take it any more.

Now frankly if you are a pro, that initial setup is nothing.  Once you are in, this package delivers on the goods.  But since I'm using this at home, I don't need the hassle of the overhead for most tasks.  I would go for a scaled down Corel suite (save yourslef the money and time)."
"Delivered as expected, no complaints!"
"Light, feminine, clean not overpowering scent. Very relaxing fragrance, won't compete with other scents, but will stay with you for a little while.  Just lovely.  The soap itself, like any I have tried from this brand, is finely milled and pleasant and luxurious feeling, rinses cleanly.

Really elevates cleansing to a sensory experience."
"BitDefender is a very easy to use suite and so far has not caused any significant slowdowns like that caused by Norton.  Ii would rate it's performance on par with Mcafee in ease of use and effectiveness.  I have not had any infiltrations since installing BitDefender so it must be working pretty well.

Other niceties include a realtime network bandwidth logger, backup utility, and tune-up package (which includes defrag registry cleaner, anf file cleaner)

Overall a nice package that I would recommend to those that are not as computer savvy so that it requires a minimal amount of knowhow to get it up and running.  That being said, BitDefender may lack some detailed operational tweeks that more advanced users may prefer that packages like Mcafee offers."
Way to light. You have to put on 4 coats and it still doesn't look very good. It looks nice in the bottle but it's too pale on your fingers and toes.
It's like budgeting with envelopes but instead - gift cards
"This program is very good for 2D work.  It is very powerful and has a lot of tools.  I am new to AutoCAD and did have trouble getting used to it at first.  I asked a friend with more AutoCAD experience to give it a try and give me his impression.  He also liked it and felt it was good for 2D work.  That being said, he also felt that he preferred his older version (2002) and said he wasn't interested in upgrading.  He said he could make custom tools in his older version and this version doesn't appear to allow that.  The ribbon integration looks very sleek, but might actually make things more complicated.

If you don't absolutely need to upgrade, there is probably no reason to.  If you are looking for new software, however, this is an excellent choice."
"Before writing this review I used up the entire bottle of the calm shampoo and conditioner. It never made my scalp break out and made my hair super soft. If you are looking for more volume try the argon shampoo and conditioner. I basically used this one when I was wearing my hair straight and using a straightening iron. I would recommend this product. I have color treated hair with a slightly wavy, medium texture."
"TurboTax has been my tax software choice for 15 years running. During that time, Intuit has offered better and weake versions. The 2013 edition is as good as any I've used to date.

If asked to identify those chores that personal computing and online services have helped take the pain out of, I wouldn't hesitate to place income tax preparation at the top of the list. Before software, tax time was a three-day long parade of headache-inducing calculations, trips to the library for the correct forms, and the pain of the calculations from worksheets and schedules. While my tax situation has been relatively stable from year to year, TurboTax has compressed three days of extended misery over the correctness of my math to a much shorter period of compressed misery over the extent of my tax burden and interpreting IRS instructions. Intuit had a rough period in the early 2000s with both privacy and functionality in TurboTax (and a STINGY approach to how many users could prepare taxes from a single copy). Those days are happily in the past

This version allows you to prepare and E-File up to five federal returns. Installation was issue free and took less than 10 minutes in a Windows 7 machine (64-bit, Intel i7-3770 CPU @ 3.4 GHZ and 16 GB RAM). Updates since installation have also been painless. Because I had return data from last year's edition on my computer already, our personal data was already filled in, and the program smartly queried about the same sources of income and interest and deductions/credits as last year.

With all of my tax documents at hand, and a moderately complex 1040 filing scenario, I was finished in less than an hour. Other than the fundamental pain that comes with tax time: what's not to like about that?"
"I've been a computer user for many years - starting with command lines and dos prompts way back in the dark ages. When Windows first came out, one of the programs I used at work was Corel Wordperfect. My home computer was loaded with Microsoft Word and I slowly eased the office towards the Microsoft program, not because there was anything really wrong with Wordperfect, but because there just wasn't enough right about it.

Over the years I've tried other Corel offerings, every time I'm excited by the possibilities and neat options listed on the box, then frustrated and disappointed by the end results. It's not that the program is bad necessarily, just that it seems it's not very intuitive, it's slow loading, laggy, or simply the end result is not very impressive.

Create It had all those problems in spades. For one thing, this is not one program, or a suite of programs, it is a bunch of individual programs that you have to open separately and work with separately. Even remembering what each does (and some overlap) is difficult. I found myself opening a picture in one program, only to remember it wasn't the one I was thinking and have to open a different program to make things happen. Working with files that included more than 20 photos made everything lag so badly it was ridiculous.

The thing is, I use Photoshop. It is not ""fun"", but if I spend the time to create something, the end result is impressive. I thought Create It! might add some fun to my photo editing, but it's just too cumbersome to be fun, and it's not robust enough to put up with the problems."

"Poser 9 is a greatly detailed and fun 3-D art program for your Mac and PC.  If you're looking for something to create either animation or 3-D art using a Poser program then you will definitely want to get a hold of this.  The software is compatible with either a Mac or PC and it's a whole lot of fun.  Be forewarned, Poser 9 is not for the amateur and you will need a lot of practice and patience to get use to the controls and the expansiveness of the program.  But once you do get the hang of it, its all good.  If you are looking to step your game up in 3-D poser art & animation then you'll want to get this program today."
"I am annoyed that I had to buy the H&R Block 2015 Deluxe software package twice. The first version would not let me prepare my state tax return.
I tried to use the Illinois My tax web page to file mu IL return, but it kept losing my data.
I paid for another download of the H&R Block Delux software. After paying for the package again, I was able to prepare the state return, only to discover I had to pay another fee to e-file the return.
I hope I am finished paying for filing my returns this year. Three payments are too much!!!"
"This has two items in it that deserve separate mention. The first is the GPS receiver.  I have previously used a Garman GPS 60cs for hiking and such, but even as it's great for tracking in the wilderness it doesn't have near the detail that newer, larger, more street driving, oriented GPS's have.  But, it has a good signal and is pretty rugged.  That's the comparison.  The USB GPS provided took a bit bit longer than my Garmin to find the location, but when it did it was pretty surprisingly accurate.  It was very easy to install on my XP laptop, and really worked well in tracking movement and location.  The first time I plugged it in I was in the living room of a 1st floor apartment.  The signal didn't seem to go through the walls very well, and it couldn't pick anything up. That's to be expected.  Outside that location, everything worked perfect.  Easily linked up with the Streets & Trips.

A lot of details have already been given about Streets and Trips itself. I have used Garmin's software--both their North America Streets version and their Western National Parks/Forests version.  I've also become quite a fan of google maps, with occasional use of the other versions.  The major benefit, of course, to Streets and Trips is that unlike Google or the others it doesn't depend on an internet connection.  The major benefit, of course, of another Garmin or other type of GPS is that even this version packaged with the GPS is significantly cheaper--if you have a laptop already.

The software is easy to use and intuitive.  I need to poke around more but I've been pretty satisfied so far. The list of interesting places is very good, as is the overall maps and associated tools. I've not used previous versions of Streets and Trips, so I can't compare this particular version to previous ones.

The one big issue I have with it, that has me using Google a lot in short, one-stop trips is that there doesn't seem to be a way of rerouting the directions.  With Google, a little cursor click and move can shift the route to something that might be preferred for whatever reason. Living in the LA area, as I do, there are a lot of ways to get from here to there, and a lot of reasons why what might seem on paper to be the best isn't at all the best.  The only other downside isn't to do with the software, but instead having to bring my laptop with me places.  Meaning this really is something that I'd use a lot for longer trips, but not as much for the shorter ones.

I'm quite pleased, especially given the price."
Love the magazine
"I will tell you right now what makes this piece of software one of a kind.

Most (other) language learning software is based on templates. They have a single template for your learning needs and they just fill the blanks for each different language. That's just like having a single universal template on how to ""drive"" and then hoping to fill the blanks for a car, a bike, a truck and a tank, no matter how different they actually are.

Fluenz is different. Even though they probably follow similar scenarios for the different languages, it's downright obvious that each lesson was created from scratch according to the language's specific traits and difficulties.

All the explanations you'll find in Fluenz French are there for a reason, and that reason belongs to the specific language you are learning. What may need 10 minutes of explanation in one language, may take no time in another.

Something else Fluenz gets right is that they teach you how to say ideas in the new language, not only words and grammar, but whole ideas. That's what you need for fluency. I've been learning languages for quite a while, English is not even my native language, and you can trust me when I tell you that having to construct phrases in your head putting grammar rules and words together every time you speak will take you nowhere.

Finally, perhaps irrelevant at first sight but unmistakably important a few hours later: it has the right ambiance. It has nice background music, i.e. it doesn't feel mechanic or boring.

I'm not an easy guy to please with this kind of software but so far I've done about one third of the program and I'm extremely happy with it."
"Norton Security with Backup is the latest incarnation of Norton 360. Well, that may be over simplified. Norton has revamped their retail security lineup with the home line simplified to pretty much Norton Security with or without backup.

This application comes with licensing for 10 devices: Windows, Mac, IOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android. This should be enough for many families but maybe not all. You do not get the same features on all devices. I have Windows and IOS so I'll share my experience with these.

Windows Setup:

Windows Installation was faster than with older versions of Norton and was pretty painless for me. I did have to restart my Windows 7 Pro desktop. The controls available are pretty basic and there are lots of on/off controls to customize how Norton works. What is missing in this incarnation of Norton Security is the ability to white-list specific directories or files. This caused some consternation for me, but more on that near the end.

In operation on Windows I feel Norton Security with Backup is less ""noisy"" than previous versions; I don't feel like I'm constantly being marketed to death. Unlike previous versions of the retail product I didn't perceive my PC running noticeably slower with it in operation. This is a very good thing! The initial full scan turned up a couple of minor items missed by my previous antivirus, but none of these were active viruses. Instead they were inactive left over pieces of already removed viruses.

Application Compatibility Problems:

Application Compatibility Problems:
I use VirtualBox to run a virtual machine on this PC. When I installed Norton Security Virtualbox was unable to start my virtual machine instance. Virtual box seems to have problems with most recent Symantec antivirus products (including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton-Small-Business/dp/B00JKZPTPC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton Small Business</a>). I was stuck until I upgraded VirtualBox to a version which is newer than the latest official release (as of Oct. 1, 2014). This virtual machine is critical to my business so I was happy to finally resolve this. This is the only application compatibility problem I've come across so far.

NOTE: As of Late February Virtual Box seems to work fine again with the mainstream releases IF you disable Norton Security during installation. This might be a good practice when installing trusted applications on systems with Norton Security.

Backup Use:

This is Norton Security *with* Backup. The software supports backup to the Norton cloud and to local devices. It includes 25GB of cloud storage for the 1 year term of the license. I did not use the cloud option and setup backup to a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WD-My-Passport-Slim-2TB/dp/B00EO3031A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WD My Passport Slim 2TB</a>. Backup completed with good speed. There is reasonable control over what gets backed up. It is a nice backup tool. I feel it's important to note that Windows 7 Pro and newer have a good built-in backup tool that is free, easy to use and will backup to a local device or network share.

Norton Security with Backup provides a cloud option and is even easier than the windows Backup. Is it worth the extra cost over the non-backup version? Not for me on a Windows PC with local backup media. It could be desirable for a lot of folks, especially those wanting cloud based backup.

Mobile Support:

I have tried the IOS app on my iPhone and it is a disappointment to me. It has a few features which do not include any virus protection:
1) locate your phone: this placed my iPhone 4S a mile way from its actual location!!
2) it can ring your phone: I can just dial the number
3) it has a ""scream"" function: makes your iPhone put out an annoying siren like noise

If the ""scream"" actually sounded like a scream this app would at least have some entertainment value. If you have more devices than the 10 allowed in this product, don't waste one of these with the IOS app! The IOS support is pretty poor.

I have read that Android devices have better support against malware, but I don't have an android device to try this out.

Conclusions:

This incarnation of Symantec's Norton line of retail/home security products is pretty good. It finds things other antiviruses on this computer did not and does not seem to slow things down. I had one application that had a problem, but nothing else. Backup is pretty decent. Mobile support for iPhone/iPad is poor. The user interface is simple, but hides away some advanced controls like white listing of applications, files or folders. It is probably a good tradeoff for most home users.

Because it's a great product for most people, but I had an application problem and the IOS app is poor I'm giving it 4 stars."

"Kindle is an average e-reader, especially if you are on Android.  There are many features in other readers.

UNFORTUNATELY, and this is the worst aspect of Kindle, is that it is a closed ecosystem.  By that I mean, you have to buy all your books that you want to read from Amazon.  There is no way to import ebooks that have been purchased from other sources, even if you convert them to the encrypted Kindle format.  I personally believe that once a book is purchased and downloaded, you should be able to do with it as you please (as long as you preserve the author's copyrites.  This really annoys me with Kindle and other products that do the same (e.g. TIVO).

There are workarounds, but they are cumbersome at best.  If you want to buy books from Amazon and have them imprisoned inside Kindle, then you will probably be okay with this product.  Frankly, this is one of the reasons I rarely buy books from Amazon."
"I'm the CTO of an IT company who uses a mac, but needs Windows.  So I've been using VMware and Parallels alternately for years.  I had most recently been on Parallels 7, and when I upgraded to the Parallels 8 Beta, I had no problems.  No issues.  The migration was fine, and after the upgrade, the VM ran beautifully.  I'm on an SSD so any benefits to the claims of faster booting isn't something I'd really notice, as my system was already booting in less than 15 seconds anyway.  The tools installed fine, dragging and dropping from my physical laptop's desktop to the VM's desktop and vice versa worked great.  Publishing the apps from windows into Mac worked without any hitches as well, but I only did that for testing as I don't run my VM's in that mode - I prefer the windowed mode to keep everything separated.
Only glitch I've hit is one that's been around forever that I've hit in both VMWare and Parallels, and that's the random hiccup with the networking, where it doesn't connect when you have it set to ""default adapter"" and you have to go to the VM tools and force it to use physically the card you're on.  With my previous Macbook Pro it was annoying as I had the gigabit onboard and the wireless, and I changed from one to the other depending on whose network I was on and whether there was wireless available.  But I'm on the new Retina MBP which doesn't have a built in Ethernet, so I can at least leave it set physically to my wireless and be working.  It's easy enough to remember when I pull out the thunderbolt gigabit adapter to change the settings if needed.
All in all, another rock solid product.  If it weren't for that little glitch sometimes with the adapter settings if you're trying to bridge the network, I'd be great."
"This brand is really nice for brunette hair color. The shampoo gives nice body, shine and condition. I love the scent, it is not chemically based, so I choose these types. The bonus 2 pack was a very good deal too. It helps my natural hair dye keep its color longer too.."
"I am no techie. Wish I were. I do not understand programs very well and seldom get past ""entry level"" when it comes to funcionality.  All I can say for this program is that it is very user friendly. No need to study the manual before jumping in. You can install and begin using right away. You'll need to figure out some things as you go, but getting started is easy.
There do seem to be some ""bugs"" as with almost all new versions of software, and I'm sure the company will be working to iron these out.  Compared to similar products, this seems to be a very good price."
"This will give my experience with Fix-It Utilities Professional, which took place over about a week of using this program on our home network.  We have three computers:  (1) HP Pavilion Slimline desktop PC (mine); (2) HP Pavilion Entertainment notebook PC (my husband's); and (3) Dell Inspiron notebook PC (backup/auxiliary).  All three run Windows 7 Home Premium with Internet Explorer 9; the HPs had Kaspersky and the Dell had McAfee for virus protection.

Installation was fairly easy on the two computers running Kaspersky.  On the HP laptop, it mostly installed except for the malware/antivirus program, which it would not load until Kaspersky was disabled.  For my HP desktop, Fix-It loaded everything.  For the Dell PC running McAfee, we ended up uninstalling McAfee and installing Kaspersky first.  We did try to install Fix-It with McAfee disabled but still ran into problems, i.e., we simply could not install Fix-It at all with McAfee.  We were going to take McAfee off the Dell anyway.  Once we had Kaspersky loaded onto the Dell, it still took three hours to load Fix-It because we kept getting error messages saying that the program had stopped functioning.

I was not unfamiliar with this type of performance program, having run TuneUp Utilities for the previous year with no problems whatsoever.  Fix-It offers most of the same features as Tune-Up, including pc analyzer, registry repair, one-click pc maintenance, program optimizer, and browser acceleration.  The file shredding and lost data recovery functions were enhancements over TuneUp.  Ironically, Fix-It advertises the ability to stop ""frustrating PC crashes.""  Well, we did not have any PC crashes before installing Fix-It.  About three days after installing Fix-It, both my computer and my husband's started experiencing the ""blue screen of death.""  For those of you unfamiliar with this unpleasant phenomenon, the entire screen goes blue with writing to the effect that Windows has encountered an insurmountable error and is going to shut down.  All data in progress at that point is lost.

Over the next four or five days, both of the HP computers experienced several blue screens.  We have had these HP's for about three years, and prior to installing Fix-It, we literally had never had any blue screens on these computers. Both my husband and I have been using pcs for over 20 years and are fairly experienced, but we do not have the patience, much less the special expertise, to deal with constant blue screens and the potential damage they can do.  We therefore took Fix-It off all three computers.  Since uninstalling Fix-It, the blue screens have stopped.  In particular, uninstalling Fix-It from the Dell turned out to be a royal pain. Under these circumstances, I cannot recommend this program."
Love these cards. They are life savers for gifts!!!
"Let me start by saying that I am in no way a Microsoft or Windows basher.  I have installed and used Windows from version 2.4 (yes, there was such a thing) through 3.0,3.1,95,98,ME,NT,2000,XP, and Vista.  I've also built several desktops and would be considered proficient with computers.  I also run Windows 7 64 bit on my new laptop (it came preloaded) and loved it so much that I decided to buy the upgrade for my older desktop.  That's where the story takes a sad turn.  In short, this review is about my experience with the UPGRADE version that I paid for and not Windows 7 it self.  If you can install it, it's pretty great.

I got this because I wanted to take advantage of the 64 bit capabilities of Windows 7.  The computer in question is older, but still more than capable - Dual Core 6400 with intel DG-965RY motherboard, 6 gigs of ram, 2 320 gig hard drives and a Nvidia 7900 GS card.  Originally it was running XP 32 and later upgraded to Vista ultimate 32.

The first problem I ran into was that because this is the upgrade version, it requires a valid previous installation of vista or XP.  What I usually like to do is wipe everything off my old drive before installing the new OS but this requirement prevented me to do so.  I don't see the point of checking the OS.  Yes, I know this is the upgrade but it could just as easily ask me to put in the VISTA or XP dvd to check to see if I have it.

Next, the installation was painfully slow.  I started the installation in the afternoon and by the next morning it was only at 74% done.  later in that afternoon (after around 20 hours) it booted up for the last time and indicated Windows 7 was about to start.  I thoguht the nightmare was over but it was just starting.  After asking me to choose a name and password (very sluggishly) I was asked to type in the product key which i did.  Then the system froze and appeared to be doing something.  so again i went to bed and woke up the next day only to see my computer had gone into standby mode.

For the next 7 hours I waited for it to finish installing (turning the mouse to make sure it wouldn't go into standby mode again) but it never did.  I restarted the computer and went through the last step again but again it froze.  This time I decided to install XP again (which installed in about 25 minutes) and wipe everything off the hard drive, disable my USB ports, etc. and went through that again.

Long story short, after 5 days, the upgrade freezes right after I put in my product key.  I have not tried the 32 bit version yet but the whole point of getting this was to use the 64 bit and extra RAM.  It's very obvious Microsoft did not test this enough for upgrades.  Even by their own admission, their own people took around 20 hours for upgrades so that should have been a red flag.

So my recommendation is don't bother upgrading if you already have a system that's working.  Either put it in a brand new system that's windows 7 certified or buy a computer with it built in.  I'm out a $100 but you shouldn't have to be.

*update*
I called MS tech support and was surprised at how eager they were to help.  I got several call backs to check on the status of the install, but unfortunately my machine just isn't made for windows 7 despite intel having windows 7 drivers for it.  I added another star for tech support's efforts.

*final update*
Overall I should take some of the blame too because when I ran the upgrade advisor, it told me that I was good to go (minus my linksys USB adapter) for the 32 bit version and I falsely assumed that it would be true for the 64 bit version as well.  Before installing, I tried to run the 64 bit upgrade advisor off the DVD but the actual program wouldn't run on a 32 bit platform which I found kind of odd.  For me the whole point of the upgrade was to go 64 bit and take advantage of my CPU and access to extra RAM so I am back on Vista (which runs great btw).  So take my review with a grain of salt."
"I have used this low cost item for years and found it to be reliable and effective. On the downside, it is an overly complicated product with dozens of features with poor ever changing documentation on how to setup and use it.

Every year, the setup and use procedures change which drives me nuts. So every couple of years, I look for another product but end up buying True Image again because it does one thing I need done well. It creates a disk image reliably, on my schedule, in the back ground, and reasonably fast. Over a ten year period, this product has never failed when I needed to recover data or a complete operating system. Have even been able to recover needed data from a 5 year old disk image."
"This is a software for you to rent each year instead purchase for permanent use. I know some tablets, such as my new Surface 3 came with 1-year free promotional Office 365, but I still prefer to use Office Professional 2010 and 2013. They are not subjected to annual payment and work as good as Office 365. No one is going to use office software on 5 devices so this might be good for cost share family members. That's why 2-star instead of 1-star is rated for the product."
great addition for the waiting room
If you want your skin moisturized and feeling absolutely great then buy this body cream.  Perlier makes such a great line of products.  I also buy the bath cream to go with this.  It just smells so wonderful and leaves your skin in such nice condition that once you use it you will never buy another product.

"I received this copy of Quicken 2007 for Mac preloaded on my Intel iMac. I love it. It works flawlessly (knock on wood). I've never had it crash or lock up on me once! It backs up to my .Mac account and prints reports, budgets, lists, accounts, anything. I like the way it autofills lines and automatically adds the decimal points. I've been using Quickbooks Pro 2007 for Mac for my business. I wish it was nearly as good as this Quicken. It stinks. I think it should get 2 stars only. I'm really suprised to see all the complaints and bad reviews. I think it is a highly polished piece of software. It makes me wonder if the preloaded software is somehow better? I don't know."
"I hadn't used a Norton product in a while since the last version I'd had (around 2003) caused massive crashes on my computer.

So I decided to give this one a whirl assuming that after almost 10 years they might have ironed some of these problems out.  Now I can't speak to the virus protection because I didn't attempt to intentionally infect my computer to test this skill.  What I can tell you is that once this product was on my computer the processing speed decreased dramatically.  Then programs started acting screwy.  Things wouldn't open, or would open and not connect to the internet.  Some functionality seemed to not work on some of my programs.  Then it was constantly updating itself and slowing the computer even farther.

After about a week of being installed this was removed from my computer (not an easy task let me tell you) and I went back to using my free AVG.  I don't have much high value stuff on my computer and I don't frequent places that would make me prone to viruses in the first place.  Perhaps if I was running a company and needed a heightened level of security the hassles might be worth it.  For me, the decrease in processing speed and the on again off again functionality issues made this a ""no go"" in my book"
"I was amazed at how quickly the software installs & updates.

I installed WinCleaner on a PC that I had previously used and then uninstalled Norton Systemworks. When I ran WinCleaner the first time it found a bunch of stuff to clean and correct. After doing all that, the computer was noticeably faster responding!

I don't know if the Systemworks was badly bogging down my computer (even though I kept Norton Antivirus 2009 installed) or if it was the clean-ups and registry stuff it did. But in any case it did the job!

I installed it on a PC with Windows Vista SP2 and on a PC with XP - Both work fine!

You can set it up so that when it cleans out the ""internet junk files"" it actually wipes these files. If you're paranoid about credit card info and so forth - That's a good thing!

WinCleaner you have slain Norton Systemworks! And I used Systemworks for about 10 years. Thank you!"
I like this item.  Easy to use.  quick and simple. lets me see all of my purchases on amazon mp3.
"There is a ton of potential here with Leopard, including some very nice new features that makes the Mac even better.  The only problem is that the bugs in this first release are so annoying and problematic that I've wasted more time trying to work out the kinks than being productive.  Going from the stability of Tiger to this has been a huge dissapointment.

My advice is to hold off a bit until they get some of these issues worked out.  Here are a list of the problems I am experiencing on both my Mac Pro and Macbook (other Mac owners are reporting similar problems on their machines):

1.  Desktop freezing - both machines frequently have their desktops freeze up, making them inaccessible.  The solution is to change the screen resolution to a lower setting and back.  **Since the 10.5.1 update I have not experienced additional desktop freezing issues**

2.  Installation woes - Leopard's upgrade disc did not recognize my Mac Pro's system drive initially, I had to run one of the programs on the installation disc in order to get it to pop up for the install.

3.  Font problems - If you do a lot of graphic design work and are continually receiving fonts along with a Quark or Adobe inDesign document, definitely hold off on upgrading.  A few current projects that opened up fine in Tiger simply don't recognize the fonts under Leopard.

4.  Back to My Mac - This for me was I upgraded.. Sadly it just doesn't work and likely won't for most of us. Checking through online discussion boards many other folks are equally frustrated in trying to get this thing to work.  Apple has recently posted a message indicating that expanded support for third party routers is ""coming soon.""  Huge oversight to be hyping a feature that will only work for those with a $180 Apple router.  Similar PC products like Hamachi work flawlessly, there's simply no excuse for this.  *** Since the 10.5.1 update Back to My Mac is working MUCH better, including a recent stay at a hotel. I'd say a bulk of the problems described above have been fixed.**

5.  Spaces - this great virtual desktop application is plagued by sucking applications into 'limbo' and occasionally cycles through the available desktops randomly when some apps display warnings.

6. Video glitches - The display on my Mac Pro (running an ATI x1900XT) often gets lines of gibberish streaking through the display.  Others are reporting similar issues.  **UPDATE:  Leopard taxes video hardware significantly more than prior releases of OS X.  X1900XT cards on the Mac Pro are experiencing an issue with dust building up on the heat sink which is blocking airflow and overheating the card.  Vacuuming out the heat sink has improved the problem for me.

7.  The new ""Dock"" is horrid..  The 3D ""glass"" effect makes it difficult to see which applications are currently loaded.  Thankfully a simple terminal command can remove the fancy effects and make it a bit more manageable.

8.  Time Machine works as advertised with an external drive attached to a USB or firewire port.  Getting it to work over a network with a Macbook is another story..  It will recognize internal drives on a networked machine, but external drives attached to that same networked computer are hit or miss.

Are any of these show stoppers?  With the exception of the font issue, probably not.  But if your system is running reliably with Tiger, I'd hold off a bit until Apple gets some of these issues worked out and releases their first round of updates.

Clearly the development team struggled getting this out the door, and it shows.  Definitely the most disappointing Apple product I've purchased in quite some time."
"I had never had any problems installing McAfee products in the past but not so this time.  On my first attempt, it prompted me to uninstall a competing Norton software had expired.  I uninstalled and was prompted to restart.  I rebooted and the installation was completed.  It even asked me to sign in to McAfee with my userid and password that I had set up years ago.  I restarted and noticed the McAfee extension on my Chrome nav bar, I clicked on it and it prompted me to enter my userid and password.  I entered the same ones that I used during the installation which had worked.  Not so this time!  It repeatedly told me that no such user exists even when I clicked on ""forgot password"".  Then, I clicked on forgot email.  It asked me to call customer service but did not give me any phone number.  I also did not find any links to register.  What?  Thinking there is a mistake, I restarted the computer again.  Another box pop up to prompt me to install the software.  What, I just did that.  I tried installing the software but I still experience the same issue when I clicked on the McAfee extension.  After 1.5 hr. fussing with this software, I gave up.  This infinite loop was just not worth my time.  Given my poor experience, I do not recommend this product."

"Windows 8 may be great on a tablet, but I'm a power user with a desktop PC and a laptop. I tried Windows 8 on the desktop and quickly went back to Windows 7. My laptop is still running XP, it just works and if it ain't broke, don't ""fix"" it.

I can only imagine what MS was thinking. I've been using Windows since 3.0 and have run almost every version since then and warmed up to most of the changes. 3 years of using it and I still *hate* the ribbon interface that invaded Office starting with 2007 and proliferated into Win8. The modern/metro interface is just pointless on a desktop or laptop and the desktop mode Win8 does have is crippled. I sure hope they keep selling Win7 for a while."
"I have had the opportunity to work with Corel Painter 11 on a few occasions. I am a complete newbie to this software, so note my review in this context. Other reviewers can provide insight for intermediate and advanced users considering upgrading their software. I am primarily a photographer as far as artistic work goes, yet thought it would be interesting to apply some more artistic edits to some nature scenes. Thus enter Corel's Painter 11. I am primarily a user of Adobe products (Photoshop and Lightroom). My computer hardware (Dell XPS 720 with 3 Gb RAM and 3.00Ghz core 2 duo processor) handles the latter software with ease, but seems to choke on many Painter automated edits (which is where I am at!). Not sure why this would be and this is a main reason (there must be a lot going on behing the scenes) which why I rated the software down. Beyond this, the software feels fast on my system. Within a few minutes of use, I was able to take an image and transform it into a reasonably interesting piece of art. I have a long way to go in terms of mastering the software (if I ever will!), but it is fun to play with, if you are patient for the software to execute!"
"Serif PagePlus Essentials is a cool desktop publishing program. I appreciate that I can quickly get started in making good looking signs and posters without complications or learning curves. It comes with templates you can use for quick projects, but if you want to design something attractive from scratch, you can do that too. I prefer creating from scratch, I find it's sometimes a lot easier to get the effect I want.

At first when I started using PagePlus, I wasn't too sure about it. However, as I've gotten to use it more for making signs for my home or other projects, I've discovered what a wonderful gem PagePlus is. It's also been fun for making signs to post on Pinterest as well.

With all the cool features PagePlus offers to make good looking documents/signs at an incredibly low price, it's worth getting.

My PagePlus works with Window 7 without any problems."
"I am the kind of person who was never good at learning a foreign language.  In high school I took 2 years of German; in college I had two semesters of German.  Yet I was barely able to ask where the bathroom was after all that.  It just never clicked.

Fast forward 15 years and Rosetta Stone has transformed the language learning process!  For years I've seen ads for Rosetta Stone in magazines and at the airport.  Looking at the price tag I was always thinking to myself ""Yeah, right.  There's money that will go right down the drain!""  Little did I know how wrong I was.

I started out skeptical -- and have to admit I was making it hard from the start -- but after two lessons with Rosetta Stone I was actually starting to enjoy learning French!  I found myself really getting into the lessons and -- amazingly -- was starting to retain some of the words and their meaning!

Rosetta isn't like tradition language classes.  You don't try to memorize words and phrases.  No, they do away with all that nonsense.  Instead you are immersed in the language through a multi-media experience.  Images and sounds encapsulate you.  You are actually learning French as though you were dropped right in the middle of France!  You are learning it how every school child learns it!

Now here we are 3 months later and I can honestly hold a basic conversation in French.  I feel confident I could get on the plane and land in France and be able to get around and take care of myself with relying on English or a translator.  Now THAT is amazing -- at least for me!

This old dog has been taught some new tricks -- and I highly recommend this software not only for business folks, but also for kids and others who want to learn a foreign language without being forced to memorize useless phrases that make the proces so difficult."

This is a great way to give gifts that others can use in a moment of need. Thanks for having this gift card available.
"Arrived as planned, allows my family to pick their gift."

Bought this on a lightening deal as a gift for me! Love me some Red Robin. There's not much to say about a gift card- yay it was a great deal! $40 for a $50 gift card. Totally worth it! Thanks Amazon!
A great way to get what you want.
"Phew - I'm relieved to be able to recommend this game.  I've played them all - in order.  And I really didn't enjoy the last two, so I was a bit concerned.

But Her Interactive got a lot of things right in this one!  Interesting mystery, with the puzzles relatively seamlessly integrated into the plot.  Not too much repetition of tasks - hooray!

The only reason it wasn't perfect, for me, was that I really didn't learn too much.  My favorite games are the ones where I walk away with a bit more knowledge of something than I had before going in.  And this one - not so much.

I also had a small objection to the ending.  The ""treasure"", so to speak, was completely out of the park.  There had been nothing to indicate leading up to it that this was what we were seeking.  And, as a history buff, I hated seeing such a ""treasure"" indeed relegated to the back-burner and used as a throw-away at the very end."
"I love animation but haven't done it in years - and NEVER on a computer.  It thought this would be a lot of fun to play around with.  And over the last several months it has been a blast - but I'm just playing.

This has a bit of a learning curve that will be daunting for children who attempt this on their own - I would suggest having an adult learn it first then work with the kids to get the basics down before turning them loose on it.

For adults - this is a lot of fun to play with, the bone feature is nice for making movements more simple.  I love the premade parts (like eyes and mouths) for speeding up the process.  But this version has severe limitations for someone looking to make anything long or deeply involved.  I'm told that the length limits and track limits are different for the non-debut version but I don't have that version so I can't speak to it.

If you are looking to make something more complex or intend to do something more professional, I would spend the money for a more complete or less limited software.  If you are just looking to play around or make little youtube videos this is perfect (and it will even upload directly to youtube for you)"
"Crappy software for a crappy Operating System that is Windows 8.

"For most people's needs, this will suffice. If you are a highly-experienced or professional user, you would do well to acquire the professional version of CorelDRAW. And to check your system against this product's requirements before buying. It may seem stingy of a company to put out a version like this, that is not fully-featured and not professionally usable, but that's the way it is. And Corel, in the world of ""paint"" software, is a leader.

I personally am finding this more than adequate for my limited use, which involves photo enhancement and occasionally a foray into morphing pictures just for fun. One aspect I particularly appreciate is the 3-user capability. It isn't that I want to give it to lots of people, it is simply that computers die all the time, taking their expensive software with them. And I use two computers, one at home and a laptop on the road, so right there is the need for two copies."
I could not get this software to work. Every time it rejected the serial number that came with the CD.
"This operating system has caused us nothing but trouble. Looking after more than 300 clients in New York we have seen a never ending array of incompatibilities and failures, simple things like the most common printer drivers fail to install, USB devices are not detected and the drivers available do not work. About half of all systems we tried to upgrade from windows 8 to 8.1  failed during the upgrade. This is really the new Vista, right up there with Windows ME. If you need to upgrade from XP move to Windows 7.
Shooting yourself in the foot it is probably less painful than dealing with the Windows 8 upgrade."
"Great gift, my niece loved it. I wish I would have gotten her a $50 card"
I believe that McAfee TP 2015 is over than Norton somehow by real-time detection.
Installed the software on a Windows 8 - 64 bit machine.  The software installed without problems with no error messages.  Before further testing I installed the latest software update.  The interface presented to the user has changed somewhat with this version of Quickbooks.  I happen to like it although I am sure some people won't .  During testing I encountered no problems with basic operation whatsoever.  This program is highly recommended.
"My NIS 2010 subscription was running out, so I purchased Norton 360 from Amazon.  After installation, I received an error message, then was directed to online support.  I followed its directions then got another error message. Called Norton Support (S Asia).  Spent 30 minutes with their representative going through the same troubleshooting I went through, then finally uninstalled and reinstalled N360. Still same error message.  I was then connected to a support supervisor who uninstalled and reinstalled at least four times.  Then he started to mess with the registry files.  He decided that N360 didn't removed the previous version of NIS properly.  On the next uninstall-reinstall cycle same error message.  After 1:10 with me, he then proclaimed it must be a W7 problem, eventhough NIS was working fine yesterday and haven't had any issues with W7.  He is now reinstalling W7 and will call me back in an hour.  What a joke!  I had hoped Symantec got its act together.  Looks like I am wrong!"
"I really enjoyed Self magazine for many years.  For what ever reason, I think the magazine is great for younger women. It is positive and motivating.  All issues concerning body health and images are touched in this magazine.  I probably have grown out of the magazine since I am older now, but it really was great to get for years as I got to know myself as a woman and became confident in who I was.

"Look up the Q2010 and/or Q2008 products, where I posted detailed logs/diaries of the endless bugs, errors and frustrations I endured as a Quicken user.

Here's a permalink to just one of my earlier, quite detailed Amazon reviews of the Quicken product: tinyurl.com/AmazonQuickenReview

I owned Q2008, Q2005 & Q2002 and I used them daily. During that decade, I observed no significant product improvements, just the aforementioned continual increase in software bugs, eternal peddling of affiliated products, etc.

In August, 2010, I finally migrated to the Moneydance product and--after the migration and learning curve issues--I find it swims slick as an eel. I wish I'd done it years sooner.

Since at least 2002, Intuit has been using Quicken as a pure 'cash cow' - a product to milk revenue out of, but making no investment in it - while it continues to toy around with other new product developments toward future revenue streams ... ... Quicken Loans, Quicken Credit Cards, etc.

The history of the Quicken product doesn't suggest a bright future for Quicken users. Don't get suckered into starting up with Quicken. Go with Moneydance."

What can I say have used it for many years Easy to load on 5 computers. No problems.
"When I think android, I think Samsung. Unfortunately, this product would not install on either of the two Galaxy 4 phones I tried. It did install on my semi-luddite brother's no-name emergency only pay as you go Android. But when confronted with the extensive and daunting  list of permissions demanded by a multi-national corporation based in  Moscow, I chose to cancel. While I understand that some of these are necessary for the program to operate, it seemed overly invasive. I have tried other Kaspersky products and have generally been satisfied but this one has installation issues and generates privacy concerns. Pass."
"I've played around with several video editing programs including offerings from Cyberlink, Corel, Adobe, Roxio, and others.  They all have pros and cons, but one of my favorites recently has been Cyberlink's PowerDirector due to it's intuitive user interface (esp. when compared with Adobe's offerings) and the fact that it is able to read and write to a wide variety of file formats (more than average).  PowerDirector has tons of features--many of which I have not gotten around to testing out yet, but this doesn't compromise the core operations that you will run on a regular basis--they are fast and stable (others have reported crashes, but I haven't had any issues yet).

Recommended."
"Throwing it away, burned my scalp."
"Well things have changed. I was expecting an installation CD but what you get is actually a subscription key card, this allows you to download the applications, but not before asking you to create a Microsoft account (or link to an existing one)

There really isn't much to say about Office that you don't already know. The reason I ordered this is because my home-laptop, a Toshiba Satellite, did not include the office applications. That had not been a problem until recently when my 7 year old started needing power point and word processors for homework related purposes.

As other reviewers have stated, the SaaS model may not be the best thing for Office, but from a business perspective, it does force you to make yearly payments for continued use of a product already installed in your computer.  It is important to note that once you install this, if you have any existing Office licenses, they will be replaced. This was not my case but before installing it in my computer I read too many horror stories related to installs of Office 365 ruining perfectly functioning older versions for a lot of people. If you already have an older version installed, it would be my suggestion to evaluate how much you need the new features included in Office 365, if you do not see much added value, don't risk replacing and old license with this one, because this one will only last one year.

Office works great and there really isn't anything bad I can say about the applications included. In all honesty, if you are not a heavy user there are plenty of options in the web to open/edit office documents."
I bought this software to file my 2011 taxes as I have bought Turbo Tax software for the past several years and find it very easy to use.  I would definitely recommend this software to others as it walks you through easy to understand directions.
"If you remember your foreign language classes in high school, it is likely not with a smile. The endless conjugation of verbs and repeating vocabulary over and over and over... tedious and not very productive. But Rosetta Stone has solved that.

How does a child learn a new language? Through immersion. Expose a child to a new language, and they will pick it up without ever having to go through the endless practice of German 101. This is Rosetta Stone's secret: it skips the repetitive exercises of the verbs and the simple phrases of the Dick and Jane saw a dog type of learning in favor of an immersive experience into German as if you were dropped in to Berlin without a phrasebook and left to your own devises.

It sounds hard and horrible, but it is not. It is the easiest and fastest way to pickup a new language. If you lived in France and spent a lot of time in Germany, then you would learn the language the same way.

Rosetta Stone allows you to learn at your own pace with this user-friendly software that comes complete with a microphone headset and companion audio CDs that allow you practice when you are without your computer such as driving or working out."
Great software as always.  Thank you TurboTax.
"Nancy Drew turns 75 this year, and she's still got her youthful sense of sleuthing... in fact, she's as keen as when she first came out in 1930. In honour of Nancy's 75th birthday, Her Interactive has set Nancy's newest mystery ""Secret of the Old Clock"" in 1930s America before the start of the depression. Nancy drives a sporty blue roadster, listens to jazz records, and talks nervously of the possible Depression, while using expressions such as ""keen,"" ""horsefeathers"" and ""the bee's knees."" Nancy's first mystery (based on her first two books Secret of the Old Clock and Mystery at Lilac Inn) finds her investigating mysterious happenings at the Lilac Inn. The inn is run by seventeen-year-old orphaned Emily, whose mother died recently, and her guardian Jane Willoughby, but Emily has asked Nancy to come help her. It turns out that she's been hearing things, and various ""accidents"" have occurred. The plot quickly thickens, leaving Nancy to puzzle out an eccentric millionaire and a forged will that has high stakes for all involved: Jim Archer, banker on the edge of ruin, Richard Topham, ""clairvoyant"" who lives in the deceased millionaire's house, Emily and her guardian.

As with previous titles, a good deal of puzzle solving is chore related, of the ""I scratch your back, you scratch mine"" mentality. This means that Nancy must complete chores for other characters before she can receive the necessary information (or inventory) to proceed. Some of these are easier than others: arranging pies, catching a 19-inch largemouth bass, finding toys for a children's orphanage, picking up raffle tickets, and sewing a dress (fiendishly hard, and I'm a cross-stitcher!).

 This game sees the addition of two new features, both of which I found unnecessarily frustrating: Nancy's blue roadster, which must be filled up with gas and keeping an eye out for flat tires, and money, which Nancy must spend to solve puzzles (miniature golf, purchasing items, etc.). Nancy's initial $3.50 flies by as you constantly refill your gas tank and spend money to purchase items, and the only way to get more money is by delivering telegrams. This is problematic for two reasons: one, your customers don't tip (although there are some very funny characters and in-jokes), and two, you spend more money in gas delivering them than you earn.

That's not to say that ""Secret of the Old Clock doesn't have any redeeming features. Clearly, a great deal of historical research went into the creation of the game, from the 1930s slang to the black-and-white photos that represent Titusville's shops, to the Art Deco motifs in the Lilac Inn and the bank. There seems to be much less interaction with characters: you hardly ever see Emily, chat once or twice with Jane and Topham and Jim Archer. The game seemed shorter (and easier) than other titles in the series, but was a welcome departure in terms of style and feel. A special note here for the game's wonderful atmospheric music: a variety of authentic big band swing with muted horns, mixed with ""creepy"" music at key points, really brings the player into the 1930s. One gripe: the character sprites seemed very low-resolution and blurry, and it wasn't just my monitor. A shame, since so much care was taken on backgrounds and animations.

Overall, this is a welcome addition to the Nancy Drew series and another fine accomplishment for Her Interactive, one of the most innovative and dedicated gaming companies around. This will be a hit with Nancy Drew fans, although the addition of driving Nancy's roadster makes navigation extra-difficult for younger players, especially later in the game. This keen game is the bee's knees!"

"Migrated from Microsoft Money 2004 to Microsoft Money 2005 last week and have been fighting with the program to get it to run properly. Spent an hour with Microsoft support in Bangalore this morning - they were very knowledgeable and tried to be helpful but they couldn't get a net worth report to run without the program crashing. Like most Microsoft programs. before version three, let it be. I'll wait a few weeks until they offer another update patch to see if that works unless they recall the software and refund my money."
"Although I've been a business owner for nearly 25 years, I'm a recent convert to accounting software. For most of my business life I used an accounting system that I wrote myself. Worked fine, but no one other than myself could ever figure out how to use it.

I put in Quickbooks a few months ago and have been very pleased with it. It did take some effort to get it up and running, but the ability to pull out reports has been very helpful. I was interested to see how this ""higher powered"" system would work in the hopes that it would give me even more capabilities than Quickbooks. As a plus, it allows for up to 3 users.

Installation was straightforward. The screen layout is rather cluttered and presents a lot of information at once. That can be good once you're comfortable with the program, but it can also be somewhat intimidating at first. This is written for an accountant, not a business owner that needs to do day-to-day accounting. However, that is a necessary trade-off given the ample reports and capabilities of this program.

Given the time spent setting up Quickbooks, I was really pleased to find out that this would import my Quickbooks accounts. Well, that's not really the case. Some came through fine, but most would not. So, I called tech support in the hopes of getting that resolved.

I got through relatively quickly, but found out that the ""free"" year of support is predicated on me providing them with a credit card so it would auto-renew at the end of the year for a fee. That didn't set well with me at all. Yes, I could cancel the auto renew before it occurred and get my year of support for free, but I saw this as an obvious attempt by Sage to count on me to forget to cancel, and be stuck with a bill for support.

Now, support does cost money to provide, and I am willing to pay for it if the support really does help. In this case, it did not. The person didn't understand the specifics of the problem, and used the support call as an opportunity to try to sell me more Sage products. That really rubbed me the wrong way!

If you're starting from scratch and don't need to import accounts from another package, this may be worth considering if you need a deep toolchest of accounting and inventory reports. However, if you're a Quickbooks (or some other accounting package) user, think twice about using this as a means to upgrade. Sage 50 may have more raw accounting power, but the company appears to be more interested in keeping their hand in your pocket rather than providing a solid accounting package that is backed with effective support. Also, keep in mind that if you do go the Sage route, don't count on being able to import past work."
This magazine is a delight all the way through. I would tell anybody to buy one issue and try it but I know you will want more.
"I wish Intuit would make a version of this product that wasn't so damned hard to navigate!  Not just in the questions, but in the forms.  Stuff is still hidden and not easily found.  It does the job, sure.  Thank God, it calculates correctly and gets you through things logically, but it's after-the-fact when you want to check and/or change things when you sort of have to hunt and peck."
"I know some reviewers question the validity of the text - but seriously - you should always question the validity of any text and do your own research. Just like with a watermelon, you spit out the seeds. This is a fun magazine, and it has good ideas. If I don't agree with something, I just move to the next article. It's the same with any magazine. I don't think there is a PERFECT health magazine out there. It's perfect for my commute to work and the articles are ""bite sized"" that I can read a few during breaks."
"I got this with the intention of doing more, but so far I have only used it for photo editing and enhancement.  It seems to do the job I want it to do. I am a basic user not looking for anything fancy so this will do the job.  I will eventually try the Draw part of this suite to create things for classroom use.  It comes with video tutorials that I will watch before trying anything else.  It also has a PDF guide to reference, too.  I will update my review this summer when I have time to play around with it and start creating."
"GUEST REVIEWER  ! MRS KNOW IT ALL ;b

This is the one and only PC security software I trust.  Kaspersky PURE has a great collection of security tools, get antivirus protection, controls for firewalls and nice remote access for management over a network.  Just an all-in-one product.  This software will not bog down your PC and just hums along once you have set it up.  I love looking in the history files and finding all the things Kaspersky kept from happening (viruses/spam).  I think this software is worth the money and sometimes you can call Kaspersky direct and get the same software for longer coverage periods at a discount--which is what I do."
Love this!  Except when it's a Double Issue week- and then I feel cheated because it will be two weeks til the next issue.
"So I was pretty excited to try this version of Pinnacle (the last version I have is 17). There are a few new features (actually more for me since I haven't updated in a while) like stop motion animation capabilities and motion tracking.

However, this one seems more buggy than I remember the last version to be when I installed it. First, I had to completely uninstall 17 (I thought I could just update but you have to start fresh) before installing this. Its a large program and took a LONG time to install. Especially since I had to retry a few times due to error messages that even now are inexplicable to me. Anyway, I finally installed it in full with all the extra stuff. I installed this on a Sony Vaio with a fast processor so there shouldnt have been so many problems.

The program itself is VERY slow and there are so many issues with syncing, playing a video either didn't play at all or was delayed and there is no preview. For the life of me I cant get that preview window to function. Maybe there was a problem with the installation so I am (gasp) going to uninstall it and then reinstall it to see if that will fix it.

At that point, if I cant get this up and running, Ill just reinstall 17. I really don't understand how they can be selling this product for $100 (at the time of this review) for something that is so buggy and so frustrating to get up and running.

I really cant recommend this at this time."
"Used it, ok"
lower price but not as user friendly as TurboTax
"I can't be sure whether it's Microsoft or Kaspersky, but one (or both) of them has repeatedly created a mess of my Dell desktop purchased in 2014 (Win 7 pro installed). Each of the most recent three times Microsoft downloaded Windows updates, my PC was unable to reboot or install the updates. Installation stopped about midway. I was eventually able to boot my computer in Safe mode, and from there do a restore operation to return to a previously installed version of my system files. It usually took me about a half day to get up and running again. My guess is that Kaspersky's insistence on doing its own updates during startup has somehow conflicted with Microsoft's update routine. I also noticed that other software installed on my computer was affected by Kaspersky's usurping system files at boot-up. This continuing conflict left me justifiably concerned whether my computer would be trashed and rendered unusable (and non-salvageable) during one of these episodes. Accordingly, I decided not to renew my subscription to Kaspersky (2014) when it expired in April, 2015.

Having now returned to Norton's excellent security program, I have noticed that the startup issue with Microsoft's updates (and other programs) described above has disappeared. Moreover, my PC is now noticeably faster. While I was happy with the antivirus and anti-malware protection otherwise provided by Kaspersky, the inherent risks of continuing to utilize the program were more than I elected to accept."
"Upon recieving this soap..I was confused in part to the picture on the site,was one of a dark pink solid bar. No rosy scent at all just smidgents of rose petals. Weleda has a stronger scented 3.5 bar if that's what you desire. Big bar.."
"I actually picked this up without reading the box. My bad.
I like to try different security software to spread my luck around on the different equipment, hoping if one has a hole the other might not, and thus skirting system wide failure. But seeing that this is not even the internet security suite, I am not that brave these days. Antivirus and antispyware used to make me feel safe, but I like a widere birth of protection these days on my personal and the families PCs either way. So if you are okay with the bare minimum, this isn't a bad price, but I'd rather pay a bit more and get wider protection."
"If you are considering buying this, then you presumably already know that this is no Newsweek or Time magazine.

If you are considering buying this, then chances are you are looking for a light read filled with items from popular culture.  And that it is.  The glossy pages are filled with pictures of beautiful people: actors, singers, models, and reality stars.  Along with all of the sordid (but secretly entertaining) details of their lives.  If that's what you're looking for, you have found it.

I secretly enjoy the Who Wore It Best and Loose Talk (What the Stars Said this Week) features.  This is a fun magazine to read when you are looking to relax and pass a few hours, like at the beach or on an airplane.  Just don't expect to learn any real newsworthy news.

To be honest, I don't typically read this magazine because I personally find People magazine to contain better writing, a better assortment of stories, and better coverage of current events.  But we subscribe to both because my husband prefers this one for having more pictures and lighter reads.

So, if you are considering buying this, my best advice is to consider People instead."
"I've used TurboTax for over 15 years now, I can't imagine using anything else."
I have used T. Tax for years.  This version appears to be even better than past years versions and is very easy to use.
"No internet software out there seems to make anyone happy, so perhaps my expectations are lower.  This was easy to install and has added bonus of additional devices being covered.  It does seem to use resources (according to data in computer), but not so bad that it very noticeable.  Otherwise, once it's set up, which does take some steps, it seems ok."
not so good with me
"It's a snap to use this software and download and install on your devices. It so cheap and easy - please do yourself a favor and get this (or something like it) and put it on all of your devices -- you really owe it to yourself and the people you communicate with to not mess it up. Get this and use it - you will be glad you did,."
WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT A GIFT CARD.
"Sorry Microsoft, but your ""ribbon"" user interface is the most retarded upgrade feature ever. It renders all your Office applications useless. I have no interest spending hours to learn a completely different UI and to recustomize the toolbar all over again (I'm not even sure if it's even possible to customize the ""ribbon""). The ribbon is ugly and WAY, WAY, WAY, WAY too big.

My advice: try to avoid upgrading for as long as possible."
"Easy to install from the included thumb drive.  New computer replaced one which ran on Windows 10 Pro.  The Home version of Windows 10 boots more quickly and just seems to run better than Windows 10 Pro every did.  The Windows 10 Pro computer always had the feeling that it missed being on a central network in a large company.  Windows 10 Pro gave the impression it wasted cycles looking for a mother ship; that it wanted to ""phone home.""

Based on owning all the Microsoft OS's from the version of DOS that ran on the first IBM PC's, Windows 10 is of course the best.  In this era of cyber warfare with the PRC, ransomware and viruses, it's also only version of Windows that makes sense since has the latest and greatest protection."
"My use of the Corel VideoStudio product if fairly limited to just simple home movies, editing, and stitching video clips together. I never had the time to get to the more advanced capabilities. For those features that I used, I found the software quite easy to get started without having to resort to long reading of the instructions. Basically, I was able to finish the projects I started in a very satisfactory manner without investment of large amounts of time. The combination of good results and easy usage is important to me. The availability of advanced features is also important, if I ever get around to using them. Bottom line: Corel VideoStudio is a good product at a reasonable price."
"Works nicely. I use a Quad Core processor. Updated my Previous Win 7 OS to 64-bit. The WIN 10 install took about 4-hours to complete. Microsoft then updated the OS and changed all my personal setting back to default. (about 1-week later) which caught me off guard. I've stopped using IE-11 and use Microsoft Edge. I experience long load times (online) and there are times it takes 90-minutes to establish a good connection. I think WIN 10 is necessary.
===
I removed WIN 10 and re-installed Win 7. It just became so wacky. WIN 10 would attempt to install the same update twice. Removed the OS at the start of July 2017. Win 7 is running great. I did some reading at MS Support / and it seems that WIN 10 Home Edition isn't very good as a purchase. WIN 10 Pro version is the actual OS. Using WIN 10 Home may be a "" come on "" for the WIN 10 Pro version (upgrade), have not even looked up such a cost. And I don't run my desktop like that. So, I must give a thumbs-down for WIN 10 Home."
"I got this to upgrade my existing version 4 Fusion installation. I'm on a MBP 15"" Retina so it's already a fast computer even running a VM (let's not talk about heat since that's an Apple problem not a VMware problem).

The process was easy enough. The new version installed quick and when I tried to load my existing v4 VM it told me it needed to upgrade it. The upgrade took some time though it could be because I allocated 150GB of space to it.

From a performance perspective, I don't really have any good tests beyond testing Skyrim. In both cases (v4 and v5), performance isn't really worth writing home about...you can play the game but there's a decent amount of visual lag to keep you from getting really into the game. There was an improvement in performance. v4 was largely unplayable. Frame rates were sub 30fps and you'd turn then a half second later the view would turn. A half second sounds fast but it's not and is very noticeable. Under v5, the lag was noticeably reduced and despite Fraps telling me I was getting north of 30fps, the ""studder"" as you turned around or moved around was still prevalent. That said, because of the reduced lag it was more playable.

If you're already using Fusion under a previous version, I'd definitely suggest the upgrade. You'll get better performance in areas where CPU or GPU are a factor. I can't vouch for what factor of improvement you might see and it might vary if your Mac is older (but then you might not be looking at this version then). If you're just using it to run less intensive apps, it might not be worth the upgrade, especially if you're watching your budget."
"Corel Digital Studio 2010 has a lot going for it if you're a beginner -- or if you're in a hurry.  Generally, I'm racing the clock, so and I appreciate being able to auto-adjust, turn, and crop photos for quick use.  If I want in-depth control when editing a photo, this is not the program I'd use.  (I have Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-Paint-Shop-Pro-Photo-X2/dp/B000VJTL1Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo X2</a>&nbsp;and Adobe Elements<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Photoshop-Elements-7-OLD-VERSION/dp/B001DMBWXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Photoshop Elements 7 [OLD VERSION</a>] for heavy editing.)

Digital Studio is basically a bundle of simple programs and is terrific for speed, even though it eats lots of memory. One trick it pulled that I didn't like was when it scanned for media on my hard drive and made copies of all my media, gobbling up room and making me say some very nasty words as I deleted the doubles. (This probably was my fault, not the program's.  I like to plunge in without reading any directions.)

The suite runs especially well now that I've switched from Vista to Windows 7 because it plays really well with Win 7's new features, especially the 'library' system.  The program is sleek and easy on the eyes, and allows previews of videos without having to open anything up.  Speaking of videos, I've never tried to edit mine before, so I'm a beginner in this aspect and I really like how easy the Digital Studio makes editing (especially since I didn't have to read the directions to figure it out).

Uploading to Flickr or Facebook is easy from within the program, as is emailing.  There are templates for cards and slideshows and while they're not very detailed, I consider them priceless.  I was able to put together a slideshow for a presentation at a convention in my hotel room the night before I was on stage and even had time to watch television afterward.  That makes this bundle pretty priceless in my book!

Also, nice DVD burning software is included."
"I've used many different anti-virus and security applications on many different computers over the years, and although Bitdefender is less bloated (hogs less computer resources) than software like Norton, I'm not as impressed with Bitdefender as I hoped.

Most recently I had a chance to compare Trend Micro Internet Security Pro and Bitdefender at the same time. Bitdefender is easy to install and setup, but it doesn't offer as much as the Trend Micro software, and the Trend Micro software was able to detect a malicious Trojan Horse that Bitdefender couldn't detect.

In my mind, that's the biggest issue right there. Bitdender is easy to install and easy on your computer's resources, but despite the fact that it provides ""OK"" virus protection it isn't as good as other applications on the market. If an anti-virus/security application can't identify a Trojan Horse that puts your computer at risk then why spend money on that program?

I'll gladly take Bitdefender over Norton or Symantec (or over no virus protection at all), but chances are you can find a better anti-virus/security application if you spend a little time doing some research."
"Bitdefender has been a popular brand name for internet security for a long time, and this is a TWO-YEAR license for up to 3 separate PCs.  Really a great value!"
Haven't installed it yet....still good for 3 more months....I've used Norton now for 15 years....no complaints...
"Call me the eternal pessimist but I can usually find something wrong with programs others find extraordinary.  Windows 7 to me is nothing more than Vista with window dressing and many of the old bugs Vista had; however, many reviewers find it to be the best thing since sliced bread.

 Recently I've been seeing incredibly negative reviews about Quicken Essentials for Mac.  Not only that, but I don't believe Intuit has seen a positive Quicken for Mac review in the last 6 years.  Something about Macs and Quicken apparently don't mix.

 Keep in mind I already have the negative mindset just from the other reviews so I'm expecting trolls to leak from my hard drive and wreak havoc on my accounts.  Sorry, no green, hairy trolls ever appeared.

 In fact, I was shocked.  For the intended purpose, this program does what you pay it to do.  It keeps track of your accounts, bank or otherwise and downloads updates as you request.

 True, it's a little quirky, but so are most Mac programs when compared to Windows equivalents and that's part of the problem.  Essentials is for Mac not for Windows so the comparisons are unfair.

 This isn't to say it's all a bed of roses for those coming from Windows.  Converting Windows based Quicken files is difficult and here's a clue - don't bother.  It just won't work and what you'll see in the end isn't what you had in the beginning.  If you've got 25 years of financial matter then you had better consider using a virtual machine or going back to a pc.

 By this point you've figured it's easier to just download your account information from banks and brokerages but this is where Essentials does fail the Windows user.

 You first have to download the information as a Web Connect file to your desktop and then drag and drop it to a box in Quicken at which point it's loaded as an account.  Sound familiar?  If you use Quicken's online equivalent at [...] this is nearly the same procedure minus the drag and drop.  This means you'll have to open a browser, go to your bank or brokerage, open the account, download the file to the desktop, close your browser session and then drag and drop the desktop file.  Once you delete the desktop file you've just completed seven steps to create an account.

 And who thought this up?

 However, once that procedure is done you've got your accounts up and running.  Minor inconvenience compared to the original Quicken I used many years ago that required manual entries and had nothing in the way of internet connection.

 Other complaints seem to focus on the lack of online bill paying through this Quicken, a feature I never used or appreciated in the Windows version because it wasn't free.  I've just used my bank's free only bill payment feature therefore I can't comment on what I don't use.

 Yes, you could use equivalents such as Moneydance, iBank or iCash but none offer online updating - Quicken has a lock on that feature.

 In addition, you can't lose with Quicken because of the 60 day unconditional money back guarantee.  If you don't like it, return the software for a full refund.  I've used the refund procedure one time (last year when a relative gifted me a Starter edition when I wanted Deluxe) and they do honor it.  Buy Moneydance or iCash and there is no refund since they offer a free trial.

 Overall I just didn't see much to be negative about with this program.  It does what it was designed to do and does it well.  It won't please advanced users expecting minute-by-minute stock updates and flashing lights, but it does an admirable job for the intended purpose."
"It slows everything down, as others have also complained.  It installed easily enough, but once installed, my computer's performance took a real nose dive.  There's no way I can recommend this to others; sorry about that."
"I installed this on my netbook.  Netbooks' are small, light-weight and have fabulously long battery life but this comes at the expense of computational power--this isn't the machine you use for if multi-tasking is what you have in mind.  As such, I didn't want an AV suite that was going to hog all my resources, yet I wanted active, reliable security.  I decided to give this product a whirl since it was advertised as being light weight due to using Cloud computing technology.  It never explains exactly how that comes into play, but from what I gather, it does a lot of on-the-fly checking against Trend Micro's servers as you surf.  I could be wrong, I don't know.

Anyway, it seems to work well.  A previous virus scanner had expired, so I uninstalled that one and installed this.  The default scan looks at only the most critical areas and goes very, very quickly (mine took under 3 min.).  Fast is good, but there's only so much you can see on a hard drive in under 3 min. (there IS an I/O bandwidth bottleneck, after all) so I dug through the UI a little and found the option to do a full scan which I did right away and... found an infected .jar file (that the other scanner had missed). Cool!

We have been using this on the netbook for weeks now and have not noticed any amount of slow down and it caught that one threat (plus it deletes privacy cookies, etc.) so I'm very satisfied.  On top of that, installation was fast and easy and the settings are all pretty much set-it-and-forget-it.

Recommended."
"I'm an artist so although I used this product extensively for a year or more, the day dawned where I needed to upgrade to the industry powerhouse of graphics' programs, Photoshop.  Photoshop is a very difficult, expensive and challenging program though and unless you are a photographer or an artist, you can probably do as well or better with Paint Shop Pro 7.  It is easier to learn and operate and does an enormous range of image editing tasks.  I've produced excellent original art work on it.  I also have edited or manipulated images with ease.  It comes in at 1/6th the cost of Photoshop and for a vast pool of users out there, it more than does the job.  For my own students, for one, who are going to image edit digital pictures they take of houses, this program is more than enough."
Very nice program and Easy to use !!! Very good Tech support and I would totally buy this for friends
"With the advent of various tax softwares, it no longer makes sense to do taxes on paper. Even if you plan to file taxes by mail (not electronically), using a tax software such as Turbo Tax will minimize data entry and hassel of tax research. The only exception might be if you are a 1040EZ filer.

What separates Turbo Tax from its competitors is their attention to detail. They have made the user interface little more intuitive and went to great lengths to provide a user friendly GUI and pictures. Furthermore, they have made great strides in reducing data entry. For example, I was able to simply download the 1099-D (interest income) from my brokerage online and simply upload into Turbo Tax using a intuitive step-through. This saved me a LOT of time doing my taxes. You can also do this for your home mortgage interest payments etc.

At the end of the session, Turbo Tax gives a very intuitive graph of your audit risk and how your tax payments compare against rest of the population."
"Windows Vista has to be one of the most reviled versions of Windows, right up there with Bob and Windows Me.

The first release of Vista probably deserved some of the criticism, but so did those who tried to install it on older machines that just weren't up to the task. Microsoft probably set expectations a little too high, and as what happened with the first Star Wars prequel, the end product was never going to live up to the expectations.

I did not have any experience with Vista until after the release of SP1, so I might have been spared some ugliness that came out of the gates. Since this review is for the SP1 version, I can safely say that you won't experience the pain and agony that was felt by some of those early adopters, IF you install it on decent hardware.

Don't install a current operating system on hardware that was made years before the release of the operating system. Don't install an OS like Vista on a machine that is choked for RAM or hard drive space.

The box says that it recommends a 1 GHz or faster processor, but I wouldn't install it on anything slower than a 3 GHz Pentium 4. It also says that 1GB of RAM is fine. I would say that's a minimum, and anyone doing multiple tasks should be looking at 2GB as a minimum. (You'll need to get the 64-bit version to use anything past 3GB)

Lastly, don't install this OS on a system drive that has meager transfer rates. Something with a minimum average of 50MB/s will probably do just fine, but the faster the better, of course.

You can't buy a Porsche, put no name tires on it, and fill it with 85 octane gas, and expect decent performance. Likewise, don't install a newer operating system on hardware that is years behind the OS in technology. XP is a great OS for older machines. It will run on a P3-450 with a half GB of RAM without any trouble (so long as you're not installing the latest and greatest software that expects more recent hardware).

The bottom line is to use the right tool for the job. Vista SP1 on a decent machine that was new at the time Vista was released is not going to present issues. I wouldn't install it on a low-powered machine, because doing so is just asking for disappointment and frustration."
Love this magazine and would definitely recommend to anyone who is into interior design. Advice and articles on color furniture. Definitely get excited when this comes in the mail.
"This Norton product works as advertised! I searched online and asked my colleagues for a security software product that provides more than simple protection you get from a single focus or category vendor. I(tm)ve been a user and fan of Norton for years, but wanted to ensure I got current information. I am very pleased my research led me again to Norton. This product is fantastic. Easy to set up, monitor and change if needed."
Not bad but not much better
"Super fast install in Windows 7.
Includes a small book called, ""Legal Companion"". It just gives you a few pages on each topic for a total of 200 pages. Too many topics to list here but a good reference first read when getting into any situation.

I wasn't able to download ""Nolo's Encyclopedia of Everyday Law"" so I chose the 2012 option instead, ""101 Law Forms for Personal Use"".

The 2012 version is out now so I would advise getting that one instead.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quicken-Willmaker-Plus-2012-Edition-Book-Software-Kit/dp/1413316352/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quicken Willmaker Plus 2012 Edition: Book & Software Kit</a>

Instead of me going through the specifics that are already so well covered in other reviews, I chose to share with you additional material on QWP2011 instead.

As far as programming is concerned its application reminds you of the basic text only style; no fancy graphics here. I don't say that to detract the value of the program. For example the legal manual provides legal and practical answers to help you create specific documents.

I have been a fan of Quicken/Intuit products for well over a decade or more, and now have also been a fan of NOLO books; they are so beneficial at this point I have a library of them. This is a joint effort by those two powerhouse entities.

For the cost of admission this program will at the very least provide you with a set of decisions you will need to make when creating your will if not sufficient thoroughness in order to provided you with the actually final document itself. Personally if you have a large family, or a complicated situation, I wouldn't hesitate to seek out professional legal counsel to avoid a lot of heartaches later to those you love."
"I have built multiple servers using both WHS 2011 and the original WHS V1 Software.  They both have advantages but I like WHS 2011 the best.  The primary reason is the speed of backups and operation.  My WHS 2011 system has 17 TB of drives for video, photo, music and client computer storage.

To install the system took less than an hour but you have to make sure that you have all the drivers you need for a proper setup.  I used two SATA II cards and I had to install the drivers onto a USB memory stick to allow me to add them to the server during the system setup and find the 8 drives attached to the cards.  I then moved the Photo folder, Video folder and Music folder to different drives to give me 2 TB of storage for each folder.  You can also create Video 2, Video 3 folders etc..

Backing up and restoring clients is easy and simple.  The Clients are stored on one drive and it has a size of 2 TB (In my case).  You might be shocked that it is not larger, but WHS 2011 does not store duplicated files.  If you have 3 computers using Windows 7 then it stores a program one time and knows that all three computers share it.  This saves time and speed up backups.  The old version of WHS would copy the same file three times and waste space and time

The key feature of WHS 2011 in my opinion is the speed of the backups and the restores.  To back up a Windows 7 computer takes about 18 minutes and to restore the same computer took 26 minutes. The original Windows Home Server Version 1 takes hours to back up the same computer.  The operating system has been reliable and so far without errors or problems.  WHS 2011 also allows you to back up the home server operating system drive to an internal or external disk drive automatically.  I do this to an external disk drive and it is insurance in the bank if something happens.  I restored the system to see how it works and it is easy and fast.

The downside is that I do miss Drive Extender.  I cannot believe that Microsoft dropped it from the software and WHS 2011 will not be as strong of a product without it as it would if it were included.  It has cost Microsoft reputation and made this product weaker than it would have been if this feature was still included.  Users would not have to worry about folder location and size with Drive Extender as the drive pool would have just automatically handled the space requirements for growing folders.  I rank it 4 stars without Drive Extender and it would have been five if it had it!"
"A magazine dedicated to trivia could get tiring very fast.

"This review is for TuboTax 2011 Deluxe for Federal Returns. Fortunately I live in Texas and there is no state income tax so I don't have to worry about the state portion.

TurboTax has had its share of issues but I came back to it because it does seem to be the best there is, but I'm knocking off a star because of the history of issues I've had with the program in previous years (like it not calculating tax correctly until I deleted some assets and then re-entered them). However, I was a little shocked to read that it requires 515MB of HD space PLUS up to 1.5GB more if Microsoft .NET 4 is not installed (Mac is only 330MB). Wow! That could be over 2GB of HD to do taxes (last year it was over 1GB). How inefficient we have become!

Fortunately the system requirements says it works on 64-bit systems, and now it specifically mentions Windows 7 64-bit as well as Vista. When I installed it on my Win 7 64-bit machine, installation (mid Jan 2012) seemed to go well without any problems. When it checked for updates, it found 4 updates at 13.2MB and they all seemed to install properly... so no major install issues for me (unlike 2 years ago), however I did have a minor issue. I accidentally canceled the initial updates because the program responded slowly when I clicked the Update button and so I clicked it again. The problem was by the time my 2nd click ""registered"", Turbotax had changed the button to a 'Cancel' button. No big deal though but a little annoying.

NOTE: Deluxe will do a Schedule C just fine, but it may not provide as much help as the Home & Business version. If you have been doing taxes yourself for awhile then you might not need to pay the extra money for the additional help.

I will update this review as I continue to use the product.

Pros:
* Price includes federal E-File
* Overall, probably the best tax program there is
* Does not say it works on Windows XP 64-bit (but does with 32-bit XP with SP 3+)
* Works on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Vista and Windows 7
* Deluxe version can do a Schedule C for the self-employed - but it doesn't provide as much guidance as the Home & Business edition
* Claims ""100% guaranteed accurate calculations""

Cons:
* Not perfect (but how can US taxes ever be perfect)?
* Have encountered bugs in previous years that caused me to have to delete and re-enter assets
* Might take over 2GB of HD space on Windows according to the system requirements

Other:
* Their marketing continues to be ""guide you step-by-step like a GPS"" to get your max refund... hope it doesn't make mistakes like my GPS does sometimes! But they seem to have toned it down this year (good if you ask me)."

"I will someday abandon all Intuit products but the truth is I'm locked into TurboTax for 2015 per some carryover data. I tried several others but ended up paying the big bucks for TT. It works, filed OK, no problems. I guess I could live with TT if I hadn't had 10+ years of frustration with Quicken and its forced upgrades for reduced functionality. I've successfully abandoned Quicken."

"I have a new Alienware X51 computer I purchased with Windows 7 and PowerDVD installed on it.  For some reason, Dell still is using a version that's three versions behind, version 9.  When Windows 8 came out I upgraded because I figured the metro UI would work better on the 10 foot interface for a media center PC than the start menu and such.  Got it upgraded, and PowerDVD 9 still worked in it as the program, but it lost the integration with Media Center - no more functional PowerDVD option from within the Media Center UI.  I played around a bit with other programs, such as the iDeer program (which ran, but had no integration with Media Center, and the media center remote couldn't even pause/stop/play.  I have a current version of Corel's WinDVD 11 but that won't even RUN on windows 8, and nothing from them saying they're going to make it functional.  So I looked back at powerDVD.  They had decent pricing for the digital download, just a buck or two more than here at Amazon, so I purchased it today.  Downloaded it and the extras, uninstalled version 9 from my Alienware, and installed 12 Ultra.

Immediately I noticed I had the integration with Media Center again, and it works.  Remote works also (I use a Harmony Touch).  Then I tried the two free IOS apps you can get with the Ultra edition, the remote control, and the media streaming player.

At first nothing would connect.  I incorrectly assumed like most intelligent software, it would have adjusted the windows firewall to suit it's needs, but apparently not.  I could've just poked a hole for just the app, or the port, manually, but since it's an internal only network, I simply disabled the firewall altogether.  And as soon as I did that, both started working.  I wish there was an option to select your own 4 digit code but they only allow you to ""change"" it and it preselects a ""random"" code.

First I tried the streaming.  I have 21 terabytes of digital media on a Windows Home Server in my basement - and I've tried the Air Video app off and on for somewhere near two years, and have always had issues with it.  So I was curious to try this out.  I let it take the default media locations since I already had my music, videos, and photos redirected to the server locations anyway.  And it worked.  Just that simple.  Picked videos, selected the home network as the source, and there they were.  The on-the-fly transcoding worked flawlessly.  Whether it was my MKV files, my 9 year old's AVI and MP4 cartoons, they all worked great.  Short startup time, and once they were going, no skipping or pauses.  Far better than I had with Air Video.

Then I tried the remote control IOS software, and loved it.  What I didn't know is there's even a touchpad option that turns the touch screen into a trackpad.  Which was handy since when I fired off a movie for the first time I got a few popup boxes that needed me to check things off and hit YES or NO.  Did the job.  There is even a text entry part of it.  For actual DVD playback, it has all the transport controls and even the red / yellow / blue / green buttons and such.  Response is not quite instant, but considering network latency, it's as close as it could be - fraction of a second for my press to be acted upon in the media center.

My 3D discs worked without any issues as well.

I only have a 2.1 sound bar, so I can't attest to the 7.1.

I don't know what is different for me than for so many of the people in here who gave it 1 or 2 stars...  There was a recent update, and I didn't check the dates on the reviews but it's possible the update fixed some issues so I never had to deal with them.  Or it may just be something with my hardware that it works well with.  Regardless of the reason, it's working perfectly for me, and I'm very glad I purchased it.  This was the last piece of the puzzle I was missing for my Media Center upgrade to Windows 8, and it does everything I needed and a few things I didn't know I'd bother with that are already indispensable."
I love the smell of this product. I also bought the body butter and that smells great as well. I will be buying these again

"Migrated from Microsoft Money 2004 to Microsoft Money 2005 last week and have been fighting with the program to get it to run properly. Spent an hour with Microsoft support in Bangalore this morning - they were very knowledgeable and tried to be helpful but they couldn't get a net worth report to run without the program crashing.

No need to restart or shutdown to go to either OS, just go to what you want when you need it.  Very fast processing, and no graphic degradation to speak of.  With the new Mountain Lion, I just feel it's time to upgrade.  And at their list price, it is still a bargain for the headaches it resolves.

So, just in case you ended up here, just shoot over to version 5 instead.  Unless you are in a preferred situation where this would work better for you and your needs.  But there is no reason 5 won't work for you as it is pretty good with adjusting to older programs."
Wonderful price for the auto renewal on US Weekly!  You can't beat it!
hope she liked it
Always love Amazon gift cards as gifts and would recommend to anyone as a gift- you could never go wrong!
"This is complete plundering of their customer base.  Intui is getting extremely greed with both their Quicken products and this product.  Each year they put out a worsening product set(s) at a higher cost to tyeh consumer.

Their customer base will erode over time.  Someone at Intuit should get fired over this mindless plundering of their customer base.  After 20++ years of Quicken and Turbo Tax, I'm looking for altertnatives.  Options will present themselves to the market INTUIT, and will very likely suffer the consequences."
"Love these, wish they weren't so pricey."
LOVE the magazine
Great product. I trust McAfee. I have been using their anti-virus software for years. It runs well and protects my computers. What more do you need?
If you have any problems you will not be able to get any tech support. In fact it is highly unlikely that you will ever be able to reach anyone at Acronis. I tried repeatedly using every method possible and nothing worked. Look for another product. Definitely not recommended. The product will not work with external drives.
"Who doesn't want life to be simpler and bettter. Get this for a shot of happiness in your mailbox each month. This magazine alone is worth starting a ""Magazine Club"" (instead of a Book Club - LOL) each month!"
"If you want women to fall over you, wash yourself with this. It's the best smelling thing you'll ever have in your shower. Pricey? Of course, it's $50 bucks for soap. But to quote Ferris Bueller, ""if you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up"""
"We get Kaspersky because we don't like Norton at all.  We have used this for 2 straight years and have had no problems with viruses.  We only had one problem with playing flash games on Facebook where we had to turn off the anti-banner in order for some of the flash games to work (like Farmville, Frontierville).  The installation was easy and was not too hard for an amateur like me.  We are buying Kaspersky 2012 to use shortly and have recommended this to other people in our family, who are also just basic computer users.  Almost the whole family has switched to Kaspersky from Norton."
"This magazine is lovely.

It has beautiful pictures and great recipes. There is not one recipe that I have tried from this magazine that has not turned out great. The best part about the recipes is that it is usually fresh foods that are in season and are not difficult to find.

It touches on home decorating and despite the name and despite being directed towards southwest living it is not the type of home deco you might expect. It is classic, stylish and modern decorating.

There are travel ideas and it is usually something the whole family can afford. They are usually a little bit off the beaten path and feature something quirky, fun or plain interesting.

Well worth the money. Enjoy."
"Quickbooks, like many other software houses, leaves annoying things unfixed and seems to concentrate on the sizzle.

This version does work, and it converted my 2004 QBs well.

Almost all of my sales are online and to new people most of the time. This new QBs has you put in a default name for the shipping address, only an annoyance to me. I can see why some might like this. I'd rather see QBs volunteer the name of the account and the new, added name so I could just get on with it.

I keep my account names last name comma first name style. I would imagine that everyone would if you have a lot of account names. It annoys me to have to manually edit the display name when there could be an option to do that for me automatically. This is an example of something that seems to go on forever and never change.

I do find a little more flexibility in filtering reports than what I am used to.

All the nit picking aside, QBs remains the best and most cost effective accounting program for me. Accountants may like Peachtree and loathe QBs, but for a regular person who have several online businesses that I keep track of inventory and sales, QBs is the most convenient and cost effective way to do my books.

Would I like it if QBs would listen to me and to others like me and get the program even better? Yes, of course. Still the best option for me."
"This is very good software for the casual/non-serious photographer/photo editor. Most people fall into this category, and I believe that's who this program is intended for. And if you are non-serious about your photography/photo editing, I'm sure you will be quite happy with this program's features and capabilities. However, if you are a serious photographer that needs/wants an array of professional level tools that provide uncompromising, professional level results, you will almost certainly NOT be happy with this program's features and capabilities. In fact, I can't imagine you being anything but sorely disappointed.

This is simply not by any stretch of the imagination a photo editing program for a serious photographer, and you need to understand that upfront. But, this program is priced accordingly. This is software for the casual photographer who wants all the basic, plus some fun photo editing tools to quickly edit photos for personal use, Facebook and such.

However, with all that being said, this program does have some excellent tools, 64-bit architecture support, RAW support and is capable of Ultra 4K slideshow output. But again, in my opinion, this program clearly isn't for the professional photographer, and at this program's price point, in my mind at least, it's clearly not intended for the professional photographer, so those features merely add value to this program for the casual photographer.

So - bottom line - this is very good software for the casual photographer at a very good price. If you understand this going in, I am certain you will be pleased with this program."
"Installing Norton Internet Security has always been one of the least favorite things to do.  I have stayed with Norton because of its preformance.  This year upon installing with a CD all I got was a window wanting to install or modify Dell Support 3.2; then nothing.  Upon contact with Norton support they recomended that I just use the 2009 product code on my existing 2008 NIS; they told me the two products are the same.  As for the install problem they said to call Dell.  Dell now charges for support.  I wonder what Norton will tell me next year if I stick with their product?

Update 4/3/2009  Found the solution to the DS 3.2, it is at C:Dell\drivers\R130222\setup.exe. Just change the setup.exe to setup.old and the Norton program will install..... almost.  Have two on going problems both related to incompatiblity with other existing Norton programs. The problems are an error message that indicates a necessary file could not be loaded PIF:AlertEng.dll and the 2009 virus program will not be recognized.  Both problems appear to be related to the other Norton programs.  At this point I will stay with NIS 2008 for the next 11 months, then probably try another program next year.

Norton is not a bad program I have used it for many years, the teck service has gotten very bad."
"AutoDesk SketchBook Pro 2011 is a drawing and sketching application designed for creatively-minded people. For those with artistic ability, SketchBook Pro is a powerful and productive tool, but for those with less talent it is a tool that allows even the most unskilled user to produce results with a small learning curve.

Installation is a painless and effortless undertaking. I was able to install the application with no issues at all and had a working installation in 5-10 minutes.

When Sketchbook Pro opens, rather than fill the screen with bunches of toolbars, widgets and other clutter, the user is greeted with a wide-open canvas, the ""lagoon"" toolbar in the lower left of the screen and a tool palette. The tool palette is easy enough to close and retrieve, but one thing that disappoints me is that is it not dockable. It is well-designed for docking and that it is either floating or off with no other options is a design decision with which I disagree. Hopefully AutoDesk will reconsider this and will change this in future releases.

For the uninitiated the lagoon is an arched toolbar that is parked in one corner of the screen and provides access to various tools and functions such as a color wheel, brush palette and more. It can be moved to either the lower left or lower right, and it can also be used to completely remove the menu bar from the top of the screen if desired. To pick a tool from the lagoon, the user clicks and holds on a lagoon icon, which opens a radial menu of icons to which the user drags the mouse to select the desired choice. This is a very different way of working and requires a little getting used to it, but it becomes second nature after using it for a while.

I observed that when the menu is removed from the canvas via the lagoon, SketchBook Pro inserts a wide band of unusable area across the bottom of the screen, and as a result there was no real space gain. The one advantage I found in this is that I can park the floating toolbar window in this unusable area which got it more out of the way, but otherwise I do not understand why the application works in this manner. If the idea was to give a maximum of workable space, it doesn't (at least, not directly).

SketchBook Pro is not the most advanced or powerful drawing program out there but it is packed with a surprising amount of features and tools to make even people with limited artistic talent productive. It has a variety of pens and brushes and each of these can be tweaked for size and intensity (as well as color, of course), but there's a lot more than just drawing implements. The ruler is an especially useful tool that I have not encountered in other applications, at least in the same way SketchBook Pro's works. It is more of a straight-edge tool rather than a ruler and allows the artist to make straight, precise lines with no worry of slipping or overshooting the distance. My favorite set of tools in the tool box is the reflectivity (symmetry) options, that create mirror images of what you draw as you're drawing. This can be a time saver.

The help system is top-notch and is arguably the best help system I have seen with an application of any type. It is a browser-based help system, very easy to follow and very well-designed with lots of eye appeal. Searching and finding information is straightforward and easy, and the overall system is very responsive.

AutoDesk has done a nice job with SketchBook Pro 2011. It is powerful and very easy to use and is well suited for the casual doodler as well as professional artists. There are a couple of design decisions in the interface that are puzzling but these are matters of personal taste, and overall the clean, uncluttered canvas gives the artist more room in which to work than most other applications of this type. At the price point, SketchBook Pro 2011 is an excellent application for drawing and sketching and is worth serious consideration if you're looking for such an application."
"I do have Rosetta Stone German... so I could do a large and involved comparison - I'm not going to.  Rosetta stone is a way overpriced piece of software that due to their strict licensing regulations becomes more of a headache then it is worth.

Instant Immersion Italian comes with a computer disk that is filled with vocabulary, a DVD and a game disk.

The Vocab disk is exactly that - list after list of vocabulary and short phrases.  They are all pronounced for you, have definitions for you and little clip-art drawings to go with them.  I can now count in Italian.  What it does not have is sentence structure, phrasings or grammar.  You will not be speaking Italian fluently from this disk, you may at best stumble through some erroneously constructed sentences using Italian words.

The DVD... I can't comment on the DVD because it won't play in my PS3, Xbox or laptop so maybe someone else can comment on what the DVD is all about.

The Games, well the games loaded... but we were unable to play them as they froze up as soon as they loaded.  I really would have liked something like the old school ""where in the world is Carmen Sandiego"" but I'll never know since the disk doesn't seem to want to work in either my or my boyfriend's laptops.

For the price, this is an excellent tutor for someone taking an Italian class that wants some extra work on their vocabulary.  This will not however, teach you to be fluent in Italian.  Sorry."
Got it for our laptop happy with it
so good
"I have used Quicken for over a decade, all the way from the DOS version of it. This is by far the worst version that I have purchased. Half the time the downloaded updates do not work and I have to do them one at a time instead of as a ""One Step Update"" (HA!). Then, usually the first time I start the program up each day, it moves as slow as a rock until I close it and re-open it again, and even then it is no speed demon. It has locked up on several occasions. Intuit seems to love to make simple things very difficult and bug it up in the process. This is a horrible version and I really wish I had not upgraded to it, but now I am stuck with it. I hope when I upgrade again, it will be much, much better. I don't see how it could be much worse."
Prime User and I like it.
No seal on bottle. Extremely runny. Like water. Seams tampered with.
OK for 2012.  Good software and easy to use.
"Pretty decent security, has more features than I hope I ever need.  The only complaint I have is for some reason this June Norton added some features I don't plan on using with annoying popups reminding you it is there.  You just have to click on the don't ask me again option, but I would rather not be bothered to decline features that I didn't want to begin with. I hate popups, I don't want my security software to come with them."
"The Step-by-Step Interview doesn't allow Invesment Management expenses to my broker (it puts an error message concerning investment interest when I am working in the investmetn expense catagory) and does not link to the Foreign Tax credit form as it states it should.  If I didn't know the IRS system better than the Step-by-Step Inverview, I would have been charged an extra $1700 in taxes.  No mistakes on the calculations; just that the proper information could not be entered during the interview.  I had to force TurboTax to enter the information correctly using the FORMS entry.  Even then it put the dividends in the Interest column of the Form 1116 (which I had to OverRide).  I guess this does not violate their accuracy guarantee, because it would not cause you to have a penalty with the IRS, but the effect is still too much money leaving my pocket.  From the TT Live Community I found that the foreign Tax credit problem has been a multiyear problem that has not been fixed.  WHY???

Also the Business version WILL NOT IMPORT from a Brokerage.  How many businesses and Trusts have investment transactions?  I bet a large percentage do; but it will not import from the brokerages like the Personal Version of TurboTax."
"October 2017 issue has 49 pages of covers, directory, crossword puzzle & (finally) readable content.  The remaining 16 pages were full page ads.

The content (mainly recipes) is moderately interesting, just know what you are getting.  Not a magazine I'll renew."
A giant mess of a product but I use it for the point of sale credit card processing.
Love this product
"Unlike many other companies, when you want to update toast you are faced with a time consuming process.

You must register the product (with your email address). Create an account. Log into that account. Download your update. Reinstall the software (on my most recent update I had to re-enter the CD license key)!

What a hassle!

If not for the difficult updating procedure this software could be rated 4 or 5 stars."
"I purchased the 2013 Quicken before researching on Amazon - stupid error. First - I had the same trouble doing the transfer as other users - there was no warning that the password on my old file had to be removed before the upgrade was installed, so I could not open my data file.

So, three hours later, having finally deduced that there was no other option than to uninstall 2013 and reinstall 2010, then remove the password, reinstall 2013 (but this time in a separate directory)and transferred the file and decided against a password for now, tried entering a few transactions.

Rubbish! Total RUBBISH! Entering a price for a listed option took no time at all, but after each entry, the program ground away for up to 20 seconds before allowing entry of the next option price. (Quicken does not download option prices correctly, so they have to be manually entered) Everything is slowed down in the Budget area, making the feature valueless. Presentation is  changed for many reports, so you have to re-learn report building, etc. etc. etc.

After trying the system for several days, I uninstalled 2013, returned to 2010 Premier, and pray that Microsoft will see the errors of their ways and bring MSMoney back. Of course, when I took the software back to the retailer from whom it was purchased, demanding refund, the store refused - but one of the clerks told me that ""lots"" of people had returned theirs as well, and Intuit's response had been that the customers were just trying to cheat their way out of paying for ""a perfectly good product.""

A last point - Intuit gives you an on-line discount of 20% on their garbage product, some banks tout that they have negotiated the same 20% discount - Amazon makes it 30% - but I wouldn't buy it again with a 100% discount and an apology letter from the Chairman of the Board of Intuit after he fired the Intuit developers and their over-paid management for this software travesty.

 - - - - - subsequent update 1/1/2013

Glitches? You betcha !!! If you are working on a PC with a non-US keyboard and/or a non-US English compatible character set, you have to re-set your entire system to use the US English standard, which wreaks havoc with spreadsheets, correspondence and non-US proprietary software files. Reports are not easy to define when multiple currencies are involved, and currency conversion is confusing at best. Oh, yes - when you re-start your system after re-setting the character set, your internet connection parameters are lost, so figure on re-entering them from scratch - pay no attention to the error messages spat out by Quicken - they are wrong. Just re-set the connection, and re-start Quicken as soon as you calm down from your hissy fit about the absurdity of a badly-QC'd software from a $***&U*I outfit like Intuit.

BLACKMAIL !!! BLACKMAIL !!! BLACKMAIL !!! BLACKMAIL !!! I have used TurboTax from this same renegade outfit since before the Roman Empire was founded, and whilst having the occasional gripe, loved the tax preparation software. But if you purchase TurboTax 2012, IT WILL NOT TRANSFER YOUR DATA FROM THE 2010 QUICKEN SOFTWARE - YOU HAVE TO UPGRADE TO 2013 QUICKEN IN ORDER TO TRANSFER YOUR FINANCIAL DATA FROM 2012 !!!

This kind of entrapment of customers - deception if you are feeling charitable, highway robbery if you are being realistic  - is totally unacceptable, reprehensible and borderline theft. My license to use 2010 Quicken was valid throughout 2012, yet Intuit won't allow me to transfer my data to Turbotax because the license expires in 2013 ???

This kind of maltreatment of customers is why I curse the days of birth of the Intuit developers and their demonic management, and light candles to ask that their genes never be permitted to be passed on to another generation of thieves and scoundrels. I also pray that one day soon a team of honest developers (in a software company that doesn't have as its top priority the ravaging of the customer base in order to increase the value of stock options for the top managers) will write a solid tandem of software products that blows Intuit out of the water - and blasts those developers and managers back into the fires of Hades from whence they come.

Update 8 Jan 2013 - - - - -

If you have foreign accounts, beware! When transfers are made from Quicken 2013 (Q2013) of 2012 data entered in Q2010 and transferred into Q2013 because TurboTax 2012 (T2012) will not take data from Q2010 . . . Euros are not converted to Dollars when the transfer to Turbotax is made! My compensation is paid directly into an account in Europe denominated in Euros - but the transfer takes the total amount and calls it dollars. The interest on my bank account is kept as the same number, but shown as dollars, not Euros. Same for everything else I've checked so far. I don't think the IRS would be amused if I trusted Intuit's software. Neither should you."
"On 11/11/14 I renewed my Norton subcription with the CD product. After installing the CD, it said it was recommended to install ONLINE and so I did. I had to enter my username and password. Norton recongnized the newer version but it didn't update the remaining days (366).  Once the ONLINE installation was completed. There still was a screen opened by Norton which is the same screen that recommended updating this newer version ONLINE, but I decided to install it using the CD.

The CD took off and installed itself in about 2 minutes. I then went to my Norton Account which was still opened and it was then it showed a 30 day free subcription countdown. Next to that it had ... I think it said a update icon. I clicked onto that and the Countdown changed to 367 days remaining on my new subscription. So, I was happy.

Also, if you've used Norton throughout the years and have other Norton Accounts using old email addresses, the way to delete them is to CHAT ONLINE with Norton by going to their website and contacting their techs, use your old email address when you fill out the form to start the chat, once they get to you, tell them to delete the old account with the old email address and they will do it."
"DOES NOT FULLY WORK. after last years fiasco they ""reinstated"" the forms for deluxe. but the problem is some of the forms glitch, not allowing you to e-file.

after many LOOOOOOONG phone calls with ""tech support"" being hung up on numerous times when being ""transferred to a second tier"" I have come to the conclusion that they don't really seem to care about customer support, or even have an idea on how to fix the problem, as they seem to do noting but stall.  After several calls, you get to explain over and over that you did the steps they are suggesting several other times with the other tech support people that still can't figure out that the program itself is malfunctioning.

I think that the ""second tier help"" they talk about is just a ruse to keep you on the line for over an hour, and then their systems hangs up on you and you get to start over.

probably be easier to do it manually. (a lot less frustration and heartburn)

buy the way, tech support will not call you back when they (accidently?) hang up on you.

what is strange is that in previous years it worked fine, so what changed? (the software?)"
"I bought both Windows 7 Home Premium and Windows 7 Professional pre-release.  Disregard all of the hype of the last 6 months - Windows 7 is NOT worth the cost, the time, the risks, or the hassles of upgrading.  My most reliable computer is still my Windows XP.

In addition - if you have the Vista Home Premium - you can NOT use the Windows 7 Professional upgrade.

With Windows 7 you get slight improvements on the task bar and interface - however - you risk losing your data, having to do a complete reinstall of ALL of your programs, and then - when you finally have it installed - many of your programs will crash with Windows 7.

DO NOT UPGRADE - if you have a working system.  The improvements are very marginal."
"I am running on a Win 7 (64-bit) machine and all seems well.  I was a satisfied ccleaner user and I have been very pleased with NU's performance.  I like to aggressively clean my PC, as my kids like to go to game sites and seem to pick up a lot of junk, and I tend to keep the C: pretty clean.  Upon installation I understood the importance of customizing what NU would do (I always did this with CCleaner).  I took the time initially to set this all up so that there were no surprises.  I am also using Norton Internet Security 2013 and I am having no problem with the two of them.  I like the interfaces within the product and it has been a breeze to use."
Too many ad's
"No-one who is serious about personal financial accounting should buy this product.

Intuit has foisted yet ANOTHER outrage on the Mac user community with ANOTHER farcical release of a sub-par product. Yet ANOTHER so-called ""Quicken for Mac"" that is incompatible with and requires conversion from ANY of its own Quicken for Windows products; that lacks numerous essential features Quicken for Windows has had for years such as multiple currency capability.

Intuit has had 26 years to get it right, since the first Quicken for Mac in 1989. All they have done with their Quicken for Mac range since at least 2007 is produce the least capable of all personal finance software for Mac.

What is Intuit thinking? Do they think at all? What rational conclusion is possible from release of Quicken for Mac 2016after the debacles of Quicken Essentials and Quicken for Mac 2015than that Intuit thinks we Mac users are innumerate idiots, dupes, pushovers to have our pockets picked?

If you match that description, this is the product for you. If not, a swathe of far better full-featured Mac personal finance software is availableincluding iBank, Moneydance, SEE Finance, GnuCash and MyMoney.

Have I fallen into the trap and bought it? Noand I will not. I've read and compared its specifications with other products, including its immediate predecessor Quicken for Mac 2015, which I own. (See my detailed review, with 93 comments, on that disaster at https://www.amazon.com/review/RB8PUB93R2QVO/) . This is all rational and reasonable assessment needs to show that Quicken for Mac 2016 is a sub-par product.

Run, fly, flee, do not merely walk, from Quicken for Mac."
"Ive always enjoyed stop-motion/claymation movies. My only previous experience in making such a film comes from an interactive museum exhibit over a decade ago. Although that previous experience was brief, it was far more time consuming and complicated than this software. Honestech makes it easy to make stop motions movies!

To adequately judge how intuitive a software is to use, I like to see what I can determine without looking at the manual. I was able to figure out all of the software features covered in the quick start guide. That being said, its not intended to be used by professional movie makers because it does lack the 1001+ menu controls that professionals want, but never use. If you're like me and you just want to make some quick movies for fun, then this is all you need.

Camera Setup: My webcam was already installed so the software recognized it immediately. You can also use a DSLR camera if you want good image quality (I didn't test that ability).
Frame Capture: Capturing a frame is as easy as pressing the spacebar, or clicking a red button. To make positioning of the next frame easier, you can use whats called Onionskin.
Onionskin: Onionskin superimposes the previous frame on top of your current camera view so that you can position your frame perfectly  you can control the level of transparency.
Rotoscope: Similar to Onionskin, you can open up a previously saved image to superimpose to aide in recreating a previous scene. Again, the transparency is in your control.
Chroma Key: This is the green-screen effect, only for the color of your choice. You can replace the background of your movie with an image of your choice.
Audio: You can record audio or add background music.
Others: You can add still-frame photographs or images, title scene or ending credit scene, and you can also adjust contrast or apply image filters (like black & white).
Output: You can upload files directly to facebook or YouTube in addition to the usual save as movie options."
installed easily on windows 8.1 so far works as expected haven't used much as of yet. so far so good.
"Disclaimer: I'm not a video-editing expert by any means, and I wasn't looking for something to rival Final Cut. I just needed a piece of software that would allow me to edit video snippets into a professional package for pub quizzes I put together weekly. I also wanted a decent DVD maker that wouldn't choke on mysterious codecs. To that end, I needed something simple and reliable. I didn't need the bells and whistles some might. For my purposes, this app works very well.

It has more of a learning curve than I expected. It has more features than less expensive editing apps I've tried so the interface is more complicated than I needed. But I think most users will like the app's extended functionality. I do wish the instructional booklet were more user-friendly. I had to go online to troubleshoot most of the time.

That being said, once I got my editing method down the app was great for what I needed. The resulting videos are high in quality. The sound features and the transition filters in particular add a professional sheen to my work. And the app outputs and/or converts my video files to many different formats pretty cleanly.

If you've got some v-editing experience under your belt, you'll probably jump right in. In general, I really like Corel apps and I haven't been too disappointed with this one."
"For a basic dictation software, this works well enough.  It types what is said with great accuracy.  Dragon's voice recognition is truly the best available.

The problems arise with formatting and editing.  Often capital letters are missed.  Paragraph formatting has errors.  Inserting edits or new sentence fragments will create false capitalization.  This can be very frustrating and time consuming.

As a regular user of Dragon Naturally Speaking for Windows (versions 10 and 12), I was disappointed with these problems.  The Windows version doesn't have them.  Why the problems here?  It doesn't make sense considering the same company is creating both software programs.  After 3 weeks of playing around with this software, I'm going back to using my Windows computer and Dragon Naturally Speaking 12."
It arrived within 5 minutes and worked exactly as it should. E-mail delivery gift cards take the waiting out of gift card purchases; I love them.
the name that does it all
The program loaded on my new built computer without problems and when the time for updated it to windows 8.1 the update was a dream come true. Windows 8 Professional System Builder It's a woa of a program.
Fun to dream!
I love the scent.
"(9/25/2012)
I went to Best Buy to get a new computer. I stood there and tried out Windows 8 on different computers. I am a semi expert on Windows - I've owned a 95, 98, XP, Vista, and Windows 7. I have 7 computers in my household of 5 people, and I am a big fan of Windows and have studied up each one as it came out to know almost everything about it. I feel that Windows has greatly enriched and empowered my life the last fifteen years.

But I had a heck of a time with Windows 8. The store employee had to show me how to get started like I'm someone clueless about Windows. I greatly disliked the big squares on the screen. They are ugly, take up too much space, and has no reason to be there. A small file icon is all that's necessary. One of the computers were on with the wrong aspect ratio and I tried to fix it but couldn't find display settings even when I found the settings. Couldn't find the control panel. Couldn't do nothing. Windows Vista took a bit to get used to too, but at least it was beautiful with its brand new Aero effect. Windows 8 is just plumb ugly with nothing but big squares. I don't want a big sign of ebay on my screen, but even if I did, I don't need it that big.

Finally, I got so annoyed that I did not get a new computer but instead, went home and ordered online a desktop that has Windows 7.

My prediction: Microsoft has maxed out on Windows with Windows 7. They will never produce any better Windows than 7.

Note to self: Be satisfied with Windows 7 and never expect anything more from Microsoft.

I will post this comment on Amazon now and add to it 5 or 10 years later. If my prediction proves to be wrong (which would be great for everyone) I will admit that I am wrong in the above prediction. If I turn out to be right, I will gloat.

(10/22/2013)

I wrote the above a year ago. A couple of months ago, I bought a new laptop directly from Dell. They still give the option of Windows 7 or Windows 8, and I chose 7 because my laptop does not have a touch screen.  Just so you know,even now, you can still buy a brand new Windows 7 computer if you want to. My new computer's aero effect looks so good, sometimes I just sit and admire it!

Funny story: A friend of mine recently went to Turkey and told me it was paradise on earth. He has a Windows 8 computer. I ask him to email me some pictures of the paradise, but he says he can't because he still hasn't figured out how to use Windows 8! I laughed when I heard him say that.

Another funny story: my son was telling his school friend on the phone how to do something simple on the computer. I heard him yell, ""Just go to the Start button and choose control panel!"" Then he yelled, ""Why can't you find the Start button, it's right there on every computer!"" So I had to interrupt to say that if his buddy has Windows 8 there is no Start button. My son's jaw dropped, then he screamed, and in the end, his friend still couldn't do the simple thing. It made me laugh, though.

One last thing: I just want to clarify this: I don't mind learning a totally different kind of Windows if it's better. I love computers and I love what's new and better, even if it has a steeper learning curve. But I don't like ugly. Windows 8 is ugly up front, and I will not give up the beautiful Windows 7 for something ugly!"
"Fist, there is not much new here and it isn't worth the price in my opinion.  I run both 2007 and 2010.  The licensing terms are so poor, no one should consider buying this.  It is for this reason, I switched my business to Google Apps.  They just work, they are inexpensive and they are constantly being enhanced.  Why Steve Ballmer still has a job is beyond me."
"I understand the basics of anti-virus and anti-spyware, but I have no clue what a rootkit is or why I don't want one.  I work with various software applications and with online remote control of other computers, so what matters to me is speed and smooth operation.
Having run this software for two months with no noticeable lags in computer performance and no takeover of my computer by XenothianGeeks, I give Vipre my seal of approval."
This soap has a very nice fragrance. It is not too strong or perfumy. The bar of soap itself is very large. It lathers up well and rinsed cleanly. A great bar of soap to use in the guest bathroom. It will impress your guests!
"If you have a home office or small business and need protection against the nasty bugs and sneaky worms that thrive in the cyberspace lottery, then McAfee Total Protection can help you make sure that your number never comes up.

The default settings provide very strong protection against viruses, Trojans, worms, malicious ActiveX controls and Java applets. The SecurityCenter has easy tabs which make it simple to review your computer's security status, check for updates, and fix potential security issues.  Besides the VirusScan tab there's also Personal Firewall Plus, Privacy Service and SpamKiller.

McAfee automatically downloads updated virus definitions from the internet on a regular basis. Staying up to date will dramatically decrease any possibility that a virus will infect your computer. McAfee usually comes out with new virus definitions on a daily basis. A subscription is needed for this service, but this package includes licenses for three users. Techies at the office have also reported that McAfee uses less system resources than Symantec and also picks up viruses that Symantec might miss.

McAfee VirusScan offers a wide list of features. You can set VirusScan to scan your computer at a preprogrammed time. The program also scans for spyware and adware.  The SpamKiller really knows its stuff, and also updates automatically.

With regard to installation, there are absolutely no problems when installing to a clean system (no previously installed Virus Suite.)  However, when switching from Symantec to McAfee you may need to do some research online to get Symantec uninstalled.

Bottom line: Using McAfee improves your odds against the critters of cyberspace, so make sure you get it right the first time.

Gift cards are great
"This is a very affordable solution for households who need Microsoft office without the fancier applications like Access or Publisher.  You're allowed 3 installs.  I'm not sure whether that means you can move one copy to a newer computer if you delete it off the old one but regardless,this deal can't be beat.  Well, it CAN be beat if you have a student ID and your university has a licensing contract with Microsoft but for mere mortals, it's a great deal."
"Not adding much that hasn't been said above. Just a bit about my experience:

When I started with Amazon Cloud, they had an app that let you keep a folder on your computer up to date with your Amazon Cloud storage. Simple and easy. Works on a Mac, works on Windows, even works on things like tablets. That's just like Dropbox, Google and several others. I rumbled along not paying a lot of attention to changes. Now I go to install it on a machine I had to wipe. Surprise !!!. When I go to get the same old app to sync things up, it's no longer available. I can keep using it on the machines that it's still loaded on. The re-formatted machine is out of luck.

Is there a gotcha with the ""sync"" approach? Sure there is. If you have 200 Gb of pictures on your cloud, you *do not* want to sync them all with that old laptop with the 160 Gb disk. It's not going to work... All of the people writing the sync stuff allow you to select what you do and do not want to sync to this or that machine. It takes a bit of thought, but it's not that hard.

Any bets on how likely this makes me to sign up for the ""Unlimited Everything"" plan and use their silly new app to get things on and off their cloud storage? Unless they come up with a sync solution, I would avoid using their service. It's just not as useful as some of the others.

Why *would* I use their service? About the only use case I can see is for backups. Do a disk image each hour / day / week / month, zip it up and encrypt it. Feed it up to the unlimited plan with their app. If you have a disaster and need to recover, download it and start from there. May not save you from the ransomware guys. They might hit the backups as well as your main disk. It might work when the whole town and every computer in it goes under water."
Delivered as promised
Worked as expected
"Sadly, mine wouldn't stay stuck to my bathtub, so it moved with me whenever I moved, and when I sat up, it bobbed to the top of the water.  No matter how hard I tried, it wouldn't stay suctioned for more then 10 seconds.

The material is nice and it was easy to blow up.  It is very soft to lay on, but you do have to have a place to let it dry, because the material is like a terry cloth material and it absorbs a lot of water.  I would only suggest ordering this if you have a bathtub that is slick, and not dimpled.  Porcelain or ceramic would be best.  Mine is plastic with dimples and that might be one of the reasons it wouldn't stay in place.  The other reason is that the suction cups are pretty flattened and cheap looking."
I bought this because I had a two computer subscription that was already in use so I needed another one for a third computer. It's easy enough to use the key card. My biggest gripe is the fact that I had to create a whole new account. I couldn't just add this to my existing account. That's annoying. You can only have one subscription at a time.
"I bought Panera gift cards for a family member so he can get some of their good tomato soup, broccoli and cheese soup, sandwiches and salads.  Their bakery has some good-looking items.  Love to give out restaurant cards to loved ones as it forces them to have a good time.  Panera is working on making fresher, more healthy food."
"Pure crap.  Released too soon with way too many issues.  I completely regret putting it on my bare metal.  I only ran Windows 8/8.1 in VMware Fusion on my Mac.

I totally screwed the pooch and installed on my Alienware.

Issues include but are not limited to-
Cannot recognize my exFat formatted hard drives - which is a Microsoft designed format
Cannot copy large files - Backing up my Virtuals to external hard drives continuously fails
Cannot list all the applications i have installed in the start menu- Google ""512 apps windows 10 start menu""
Screen Flickers are going to give me a seizure!!!
I forgot how much I DID NOT miss the Blue Screen of Death.  Luckily now it is sometimes black!!!
Windows Update is now more of a virus than a tools.  You have zero control over it.
Wi-Fi works when it feels like it.  Non-repeatable issues
All my browsers have issues
Edge = Turd...  Who is the world design that mess???  Fire them...  NOW!!! It is not a browser.  It is an ADHD nightmare application.

Do yourself a favor and stick with Windows 7.  I messed up and went with the every other release from Microsoft is good theory.

Yep, I got it for free.  If they want me to install it anywhere else it will cost them $500 per box!!!"
"Norton is better than prior years: better footprint,  nice interface,  intuitive and very informative.  The fact that it never sleeps is expected in a guardian but it does it well. If only identity settings configuration were simpler. Oh well, next upgrade."
"The soap itself is fine, the scent itself reminds me of old ladies. No offense but I just don't like it at all. This is definitely larger than most finer soaps and the scent doesn't linger too long but it doesn't go away that quickly either. I would give this soap 4 stars if it weren't for the horrible scent."
The sneakers are very comfortable and fit to size.
"I'm somewhat new to actually using painting software.  I've used Photoshop for a couple of years now and am pretty much self taught on how to use it (mostly for photo manipulation) and have been looking for a tool that will artificially paint a photo to give it a painted look without actually having to paint the picture, which is what initially drew me to Painter Essentials.

I've played around with it a bit and found that some aspects are quick and easy to learn, but others I could use a tutorial or a book to refer to to get the best results.  And that is where I have my biggest complaint.  Not all of it is an intuitive as I would like and unfortunately there aren't as many online resources to refer to for help as you find with Photoshop.  I looked on Amazon and I couldn't find any tutorial books (like Painter for Dummies) to purchase in regards to this program which was really disappointing.  Overall, I like it and could possibly learn to love it once I know how to really use it."
"I am a long-term user of Pinnacle editing products. I got my first program nearly 10 years ago, and have slowly updated ever since. I've used Pinnacle 6, Pinnacle 10, Pinnacle 12, and now with this, Pinnacle 16. I work in television production so I am familiar with all the professional editing systems out there, and this is perfect for my home machine. Loading it onto my computer was fast -- faster than previous versions. I like the various video training guides. I love the fact that it now has many more video tracks and audio tracks. One of my earlier complaints was the limited number of video tracks I could use. That meant if I had a complex sequence, I had to build it in steps. Now I can do it all at once. A big improvement! I do wish it came with more pre-recorded music to add to my videos, and for me, that's it's only major drawback. Yes, I know you can burn any music you want, but it takes time so it would be great to have a wider choice of music already loaded in the system. I know other reviewers have complained about crashes and freezing, but so far I haven't experienced any of that. And hopefully, I never will. After all, I never had the problem with any of the previous Pinnacle programs. But I'll come back and update this review if that happens. In the meantime, on to editing my next great project! Thanks, Pinnacle, for making it easy!"
Loved them.  Love the easy access to purchasing them and the super fast delivery.  The come already to use. LOVE IT!!!
good product and service
"Mac OS X has some satisfactory burning tools built into the operating system, so why spend $75 on Toast 7?  Well, Toast 7 does everything you wish your Mac could.

First, DVD burning.  Toast allows you to import all sorts of video files, and burn them onto a video DVD, for viewing in your set-top DVD player.  This is a great feature, if you have some Divx video files, on your hard drive.  Drag them into the video folder in toast, and burn a video DVD.

Furthermore, do you have some un-encrypted DVDs, perhaps ones made in your set-top DVD recorder with video camera footage of your family?  With toast, you can import titles from those unencrypted DVDs, and put them onto a DVD, with fun and easy to navigate menus.

New to Toast 7 is a great new feature that allows you to compress an unencrypted video DVD image into a size that will fit onto a single-layer disk.  This basically gives you the functionality of popcorn built right into Toast 7.

Data Backup - Toast works fantastic as a backup utility.  There is even an application included to schedule backups on a regular basis.  Toast 7 allows for disk-spanning backups, which allows you to backup many gigabytes of data over multiple DVDs or CDs.

Audio - Toast 7 will obviously allow you to burn music CDs, but you can also burn a DVD.  The DVD will load on a set-top DVD player, with menus, to select music, and a shuffle feature.  You can get gigabytes of music onto these disks, and then play them in your DVD player.

Pictures - Toast 7 includes an application called Motion Pictures HD, which allows the importing of photos to make great slideshows.  They can be in beautiful widescreen, or even high-definition, if you make a Divx DVD (note that Divx DVDs can only be played in special DVD players).

Import Analog Audio - CD Spin Doctor is included with Toast 7, so you can easily import analog audio via your computer's audio input.  You might input audio, from a VHS tape, cassette tape, or record.

Discus RE - Discus RE is a simple, but convenient way to create labels, for your DVDs.  It includes the templates, for dozens of the most popular DVD labels, so then all you have to do is design your label and print it.  Easy.

[...]

Overall, I have only had Toast 7, for a few days now.  However, it might be the most useful application I have ever purchased, for my Macintosh.  Toast 7 allows you to do just about anything you would want to do, when it comes to burning DVDs and CDs.  Furthermore, it is easy to use.  I was taking advantage of Toast 7's many features within just minutes of installing the software.  Give Toast 7 a try, for it will quickly become one of the most used applications on your Mac."
"Microsoft Office has been the standard for word processing, spreadsheet, database, and other misc. apps for more than 20 years now. Lotus, dBase, and Word Perfect simply couldn't keep up on features, stability or price over the years. These days it's easier than ever to install. You simply download, enter your key, and go. While the licensing restrictions are tighter than a couple of versions back (and before), the price is also lower. I'd recommend buying the product over the Office 365 Subscription, which I think is a VERY bad deal."
The best soaking liquid you'll find.  I lived in Germany for quite some time and camomile was always recommended for skin irritations and dryness.  This Herbaflor is excellent and will leave your body soft and relaxed.  Stores that I would usually buy it from either don't carry it or no longer exist.  I also love that it leaves the bath tub with no residue.  Thank you Amazon for carrying this product.
Granddaughter loved this!
Very good product as always. Works well.
"Good gift card, it came loaded and ready to spend!"
"So far this product has performed flawlessly!! Very sorry I had not used US Robotics from the start.

Previously I had used the Linksys/Cisco switches and routers and have been let down every time with breakdowns and many, many resets!!

All I can say is US Robotics has them beat hands down!!"
"I've used a number of photo editor products over the years.  The big packages (adobe photoshop) the freeware packages (gimp, paint.net) the in-between packages (adobe elements).  This product has the capability to do a lot of things and seems to do them nicely.  I haven't really stretched the limits yet... for me, typically 95% of the time I am only very moderately touching up an image, 5% of the time I get really into things for hours and stretch the capabilities of the software.  I haven't yet had a chance to mess with this software for the 5% yet.

As a whole... this seems to be a nicely priced product to compete with the higher cost products.  I've only scratched the surface on its usage so far.

Hiccups.. deducted one star for issues with installation.  Something got mucked up while installing this on my PC (win 7) and had to fiddle a bit to get things working."
"The quality of captured video is not so good...grainy and colors not accurate. But the most annoying issue is that as you are capturing the video, it randomly gives the ""PROTECTED SIGNAL"" error and stops the process. The roxio says this error will appear if you are capturing copyrighted video, but these are my own. That's the whole point of using this! found that many people are facing the same issue. I do not recommend purchasing this product."
JUST SCAN.  DON'T REALLY READ IT.
Got these as gifts for my children and they loved them. Shipping was quick!
I've been using the AVG free version on several computers for years with no problems.  Installed this software on three different computers and they have been running fine and been protected well.  Only issue I have had is the when I VPN to my office computer I need to deactivate the firewall sometimes or it will not connect.  Auto update works in the background is not a problem.  Overall good product
"Windows XP Pro is quite arguably the most reliable operating system that Microsoft has come out with yet. Additionally it comes with the option of converting it to a Windows 98SE desktop appearance, for those who don't want to fuss with learning new instructions to get the old things done. It does so much more though.
  One note of caution; do not install XP in an older machine, with older hardware. Your sound card vendor may have stopped making software drivers a long time ago for your now discontinued device. The problem is that they do not want to spend the resources to create drivers for a product that they no longer make. So if you have an old video card, audio card, modem, etc, it quite possibly won't work with XP. If you try to install XP you will get all kinds of incompatible error messages. So do yourself a favor and put old wine into old bottles, and new wine into new ones; consider getting a newer machine if you are going to upgrade to XP. You might wind up spending close to the same amount of money upgrading your components to make it work, as you would to just simply buy a new one. Check with all of your hardware manufacturers to see if they produced XP drivers for your existing hardware. Hope this helps."
"This was the first Learn by Video series course that I've used, and I'm very impressed with the production.  For the most part I'm impressed with the content too, although the introductory level was frustrating at times.

The course provides a good introduction to the  CS5 user interface, the Flash tools, file types, and managing the timeline.  There's also a very basic chapter that introduces ActionScript (AS3), which is the coding language used to create complex logic in a Flash application. The AS3 material is extremely basic--too basic in my opinion.

Again, I like the production of this video package. The videos can be played in Windows, Mac, or Linux. There are also MP4 versions of the video files, in case you want to view them on a portable device (iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad, etc.). This is helpful if you want to view the videos and work hands-on on your computer, although the small screen would be difficult.  The DVD also includes a collection of asset files that correspond with the lessons.

If you are a visual learner or don't prefer thick technical books, then this video course would be a good low-cost alternative. Don't expect to be a Flash expert when you complete this course, but at least you'll understand the basic concepts."
"My teacher who is certified Comp TIA A+,Network+, etc told me about Norton ghost and I don't get why there are so many bad reviews on this. I like norton and Norton is a good antivirus/internet security/360. Not to accuse anyone here but I think you guys got a defect disc or something, or your OS cannot support this product. Overall, the shipping speed was great and it came before the time it told me."
"I don't have this exact model, I have Zoom's Model #3048, which is nearly identical. I've had it for just over five months, (got it at Staples), and it's a terrific modem. Very reliable and stable. If you're in the market for an external modem, I highly recommend this one."
"This is pretty awesome for a business or non-profit owner. It's a fantastic way to keep track of your vehicles and mileage. It could also be a great way to track your teens if you don't know where they are a lot of the time. I am not that good with technology, so it's a little complex for me, but I can certainly see that the program is created well and set up is pretty simple. Just too tech for my small non-profit organization."
"At this price you're not going to find a better all in one solution to computer security. Norton has had its off years, but I think it's doing much better with this release. If you actually use it on three computers, you are getting a bargain. No anti-virus solution is 100% effective, but this will protect you against many of the risks associated with using a computer on the internet."
"item arrived timely, securely packaged. Program started and loaded properly, converting my old files (2011) to the new 2014 format. navigation is improved, as well displaying the tree with more branches."
"I haven't had some of the installation or bugginess/crashing problems that others have reported.  Overall, the software seems to work pretty well.  I was surprised by the omission of sound editing software, although freeware for sound editing is readily available and highly functional."
"I have several of their products. None work well for either a PC or a Mac - and for a Mac, forget it! They have no support. You have to go with a ""live"" chat to India. The person in the chat room doesn't know Mac and doesn't understand what you are saying. All they respond with is ""Yes,"" then nothing. I was also billed on my credit card several times for the same thing. I tried to get it corrected, but decided it was easier to just pay the bills as I spent several days trying to get somebody to understand me. The wait time for phone or live chat is hours."
"Where do I begin with their lies and deception?

1) Small size on HD! Not true. ALL of the data hides in programdata/WRData and can baloon up to 50, even 100GIGS on your hard drive. Even quickly filling your SSD's.. Webroot takes up the most HD space of any AV.
2) Small footprint! NOT true. Webroot rides on the SYSTEM process in windows. Often ballooning the system process to 500% over normal. This bogs everything down and is a deception by Webroot who claims it's an 'old bug' (claiming this for 5 years)
3) Advanced technology! Not true. It's a simple karma/reputation and whitelist/blacklist app. It tosses your unknown stuff in a sandbox monitoring it. This requires constant tickets to support for whitelisting with EVERY new version of EVERY software.

Webroot is a product no serious security/IT person would ever deploy. It's a joke!"
"I paid $59.99/year for the unlimited online storage in April, 2015. I like the un-limited storage space, but Amazon Cloud Drive Desktop software is really too primitive.

My original intend is to use the amazon cloud drive as my on-line archive space to keep a copy of my videos, photos and other important encrypted documents. My COMCAST internet speed is 20 Mbps for down-stream and 6 Mbps for up-stream. With the 6 Mbps up-stream speed, it's understandable that it takes days (if not weeks) to up-load 600G data.

During the file uploading process, sometimes the up-load work got interrupted as amazon cloud drive asks me to sign-in again. This is bad as I can not keep the up-load work running for over-night. Even worse yet, when it stops, I don't know where the up-load task stops...I mean I have no way to figure out which files are updated already and which files are not.

The files/directories in the cloud drive can not be sorted based on file names, it's sorted based on the time it is uploaded. So, it's not easy for me to do a file-list cross reference check to identify which files are not up-loaded if a job is stop prematurely.

To prevent job interrupt if amazon cloud drive asks me to sign in again, I break my big up-load work into several small tasks and I make sure each up-load work won't last for 2-hour. I also have to make sure my computer does not go to sleep while the up-load work is on-going, otherwise, the up-load work will get killed...and I have to re-do that up-load batch again (not re-start from where it stops....because I don't know which files are not up-loaded.).

From time-to-time, the up-load work finishes with some error messages on a pop-up window. The error messages show the list of files that are not up-loaded successfully in this run. So, I can up-load them individually. I have to screenshot the file list from the pop-up window, because there is no ""log"", or ""report"" file for me to retrieve this file list. Even worse yet, the file list just show the file name without directory information. So, I have to use window search function to find each of the file listed in the file list.

It's sad that Amazon does not provide a user-friendly apps to help users to better maintain the up-load and down-load task. The provided up-load utility tool is very primitive. It becomes a high maintenance work to up-load big chunk of files. After 6-month, I only manage to up-load 450G of data.

For data down-loading, there are two methods. The 1st method is to download files directly from the web portal. But that has a 5GB per download limitation. The 2nd method is to download files through the window-application (I am using window-based computer). But the 2nd method has one issue: I have to download my whole entire cloud-drive data....I mean, the whole 450G !! There is no option for me to pick which file or which directory to download with the provided window tool.

After struggling with this cloud service for half-year, I finally decided to cancel my subscription. I won't recommend amazon cloud service till they can provide a more mature software tool to ease the pain for both up-loading and down-loading."
I think the best thing about this product is its size and the fact that it is powered by the USB and not an external AC adapter. Works just like advertised. Could be a bit faster. Wish I had received the mac version but if you are running Windows on your mac it will work.
"As a Turbo Tax user of many years, I made the switch to H&R Block after Turbo Tax reduced what you get for what you pay and miss lead users like me by using the same product name, ""Deluxe"".  Anyway I switch to this product and found it worked perfectly to complete my taxes.  I had a question and contacted customer service by way of chat.  It took about 20 minutes to get to a real person.  This person took my question and came back with an answer in less than 10 minutes.  I efiled my Federal and State returns.  I was a little disappointed that to efile my State return cost $19.95.  I think this is price gouging.  If it wasn't for this I would have given 5 stars."
"Excel is probably one of the best applications in existence in the business world. Power Point is quite pedestrian, which is good for some executives, and quick-presentation fixes. Outlook is great, but here's where it all ends.

WORD is simply an exercise in futility, and more of a waste of time than ever. I learned how to create stunning page layouts in Adobe InDesign faster (my first attempts at using Adobe products outside Photoshop) than I could master an already familiar program-Word. This is because Word suffers from formatting and alignment idiosyncrasies which will burn the user who attempts to delve into any special features, or who attempt to customize even the simplest of things. I recommend using Word for the most basic and time-saving uses, but if you want to create a document that utilizes any advanced features, you will be much more satisfied learning what the Pro's use on a daily basis."
"Installed this on our 2009 iMac running 10.7, and it slowed it to a crawl.  I tried to adjust the setting to make the protection less resource-intensive, but it was just too slow.  Perhaps if you have a very new Mac with more memory, the sluggishness would not be as noticeable; but for an older Mac, I cannot recommend this product.  We ended up having to uninstall it, which is too bad, since the features look great."
"I have always loved Entertainment Weekly.
By subscribing through Amazon.com's magazine subscription center, I have been able to save a ton of money.
This is the best deal that I have ever seen. Don't waste your time or money subscribing through the publisher, subscribe through Amazon.com!"
"I've been using Symantec/Norton security software exclusively on all my PCs and Macs for at least a decade. This review pertains to the PC/Windows environment only.

Over the past few years I had been noticing system slowdowns that seemed to be related to things like auto-download and installation of frequent updates of virus definitions. I figured that's the price I'd have to pay to keep my PC and data safe. I've been reading over the past year or two, though, that McAfee users seemed to feel the software and updates didn't bog down Windows (XP) as much.

After installing this software via the included CD (I much prefer buying software online these days...personal preference), I did a few startup tests to note extra delays (McAfee definitely loaded faster); virus scans to monitor speed (no viruses here, fortunately), and made sure to monitor an online update/download while my PC was running 4 or 5 other applications, the way I usually work. I heard some disk activity but barely noticed a slowdown in the other processes.

I'm going to stick with it for a while, especially since this comes as a 3-user pack, but I hate the idea of wasting the 200+ more days of Norton virus updates I already paid for. Also, the McAfee scans did drive home the welcome realization that the Norton/Symantec software I had been running was doing its job pretty darn well. On the other hand, I'm certainly willing to change at this point.

I think what I'll do is run McAfee for a while on my main desktop machine and Norton on my main laptop. We'll see if a change is in order...or whether it really matters one way or the other."
"This `upgrade' will not install on a `clean' hard drive, nor will it `upgrade' XP Pro. There is a work around, but it involves duplicate installs and other technical `workarounds' so if you are not technically savvy, don't get this `upgrade'.

If you do want to consider this `upgrade' be aware that Windows Vista Home Premium does not include FAX capability and needs the Office 2007 suite along with Outlook 2007 (which does not support animated gif's, among other things) for most eMail.

I would not consider Windows Vista Home Premium an `upgrade' as it requires more system memory, is a step backward in features, and more cumbersome to use."
Very Nice card and it looks new. Just hope it works for my son.

"Create It! Fun Collection is a bundle of these programs: Paint It, Photoalbum 7, Serif Digital Scrapbook Artist 2, and Panorama Plus.  Within these programs, you have the ability to fine-tune photographs, add fun effects, and place them in digital photo albums/cards/flyers or share them with your friends and family.

Create It! The Fun Collection comes with a hefty instruction guide, for which I was quite happy to have.  These programs fall into the category (for me at least) where they are so simple that they're hard to grasp at first glance.  Beginners should keep the guides handy in case they have questions. One good thing about this software bundle is that it seems like a great product for a family unit.  This bundle has programs that touch on pretty much everything a casual user might need, which usually doesn't stem far from just manipulating pictures, making flyers and cards, and working on school projects.  This is not a bundle I'd recommend to those who are looking to really manipulate their photography.  You can manipulate it with these programs, but not to the extent that I personally prefer.

This takes some memory because you're installing a lot of programs, and with that it takes a little bit of time to get everything set up properly.  I'd make sure to double check your computers settings before picking up because if you are low on memory, this might eat a lot of it up.  Also, some of the things you can make within this software do require additional fee's to print.  Many are free,  but some do.

In closing, this program is fine for a family unit or even a classroom, but it is not for professionals.  Create It! Fun Collection gets 3/5 stars."
Beautiful presentation.  Box and ribbon very good quality.  Birthday gift which I know will delight.  Arrived in perfect shape and time.
"My 23rd year in continuous using of TurboTax.  I have grown with the company thru their mistakes, and they have always moved forward.  That is why I keep coming back.  I know their product makes my life of filing almost easy.  Certainly compared to the years of IRS books and pouring over this regulation or that.....now it is all within my fingertips.....just a click and a read away to find out whatever I need to know.  Thanks."
"Although Kaspersky products receive excellent ratings from the professional reviewers we have been less than satisified with the product.  Protection wise the product deserves its ratings - no problems there.  We installed on 3 laptops: a Dell i5 8 Gb, a Lenovo A8 8 Gb, both with Windows 10 and an older Dell Pentium 4 Gb with Windows Vista.  Download and installation went ok on all 3 laptops with the older Dell taking longer as could be expected.  Anti-Virus scans run quickly and smoothly on all 3.  KIS does not require extraordinary system memory.

 Now comes the reasons we uninstalled on all 3.

Safe Money is one of the more aggravating pieces of software I have ever encountered.  It will open another browser to connect to your bank, store or just about anything else you might want to go to even if you are just going to browse merchandise or seeking information.  You have some choices here; to always use it or decide whether to use or never to use, none of which seem to be universally observed by KIS.  It slowed down entry into the sites to the point of timing out on all of our laptops.  Especially aggravating was the connection to 2 of our banks which use of a Secure ID card to generate a pass code number in addition to log-on ID and passwords.

KIS also slowed down all 3 of our computers especially the Lenovo A8 8 Gb laptop.  Sites requiring data entry were especially vulnerable to this slow down.  Entering information into Gas Buddy was particularly painfully slow.

Warnings about bad or outdated certificates were a common occurrence - even sometimes on the main Google search page

The dashboard is not particularly informational unless you click further into the site.  Navigation could be improved as it is not very intuitive.

Bottom Line - Excellent if You Use Only for Its Anti-Virus Capabilities - Not So Good in Other Aspects"
"I am amazed at what is being bundled into a $80 product these days.  I've used various video products over the years, including Pinnacle and a variety of free ones, and based on that experience, really like the interface and ease of use of VideoStudio Pro X8.

The power of VideoStudio Pro X8 is that you can relatively quickly come up to speed (there is a learning curve, just to understand the icons and terminology) and do basic video manipulation of a camera or phone video.  And then, there is a lot of room for growth as your skills and experience expand.  VideoStudio Pro X8 also comes with a nice set of images, videos, and sound tracks that you can start with and then expand upon on your own.  This makes doing simple things to liven up your video much easier.

I am a sporadic user of video software.  I will get onto a personal project with family video or something, and will immerse myself into the tool, explorer the capabilities, and then when done, not come back video editing for months.  VideoStudio Pro X8 is easy enough to just use, but it takes a bit to get use to the fine details of the interface and knowing how to shortcut the process.  My only want here is to take the time to put a little info link (i) by all the functionality screens and provide a sentence or two of explanation.

VideoStudio Pro X8 has more capabilities to it than most people will use.  There's an analogy I like to use for products like this.  This product is like the Microsoft Office products (Word, Excel, PowerPoint).  Each of those products are really easy to use and get work down.  When most people use the products for work or home typical usage, they are only scratching the surface of what the product is capable of.  Until you need it, and if you do, its there.  Seems to me that VideoStudio Pro X8 is the same."
"I don't have any of the other Corel products so I haven't run into the same issues many of the other reviewers have. It installed fine for me on my computer without corrupting my registry (crazy that others have had that and it really makes me wish I didn't touch this at all).

It does what it says it will do but really I don't need much of what it offers me because some open source projects I've used handle a lot of this for me already. I could see some value in someone less technical using the software though (although the open source projects today have pretty decent GUIs for the most part).

I'd say it does the job but really there's no pressing reason you need this if you are savy enough with searching for open source alternatives."
Used HR Block/ tax cut for years. Great product that gives a good preview and allows either sending forms or Efiling.
Wonderful fragrance. Love It.
"Found this stuff in Japan and wondered if I could find it again. 3drops of it goes as far as a handful of normal soap, it stays foamy and soapy and has a nice scent!"
"My all-time favorite idea was when Martha took baby pumpkins and made them into floral arrangements. That idea has been a wonderful addition to our Thanksgiving table and is one of the easiest floral projects ever!

The recipes are very unique and the craft ideas...original. Plus, you can get some supplies from Martha's website which is an added bonus.

The articles on gardening always teach
me something I needed to learn.

Of all the magazines I look forward to,
this one is my favorite.

"I bought Norton AntiVirus 2006 and it caused my computer to totally crash. It became totally useless. When I tried the regular support number I could never get through.

In despeation, I called their 900 number and up front I told the rep I would not pay as Norton caused the problem. He went along with that. It turned out Norton AntiVirus is incompatible with another Norton product, and that caused the crash.

When my phone bill came I was shocked to see I was charged $132 for the privilege of having my computer crashed. After numberous calls, I was told by Norton customer ""service"" in a foreign country that it was impossible for them to refund my money.

So if you want to have major problems with your computer, like losing all your data, buy Norton products. You can not only get a crashed computer, but will be charged through the nose to recover  .

BUYER BEWARE"

"I purchased windows Vista with a new computer only to find out that it didn't work with my office billing software.  I then found out that Microsoft only wants to let you downgrade back to Windows XP if you have their business or premium version and buy another Windows XP.  I wonder about the legality of voiding prior purchases.

Fortunately Dell let me send my Inspiron with Vista (didn't come any other way) computer back to them and I bought one of their small business systems (a Vostro 400) at a very reasonable price with XP on it in instead.

Vista is a full featured operating system and attractive.  I had a little trouble with file handling and organizing as the files folder and file features that were in XP were taken away or changed significantly. Maybe for the better but a manual explaining the changes would have been nice.

On the downside Premium Vista is memory and processor heavy and can slow your system, so it is probably a mistake on older computers.  The Home BASIC edition of Vista is fast on a newer powerful computer.  Also half of your non-microsoft software will probably not run and you may not have drivers for your monitor and printer (go to their site and see if there are Vista drivers)

I strongly recommend all business owner to wait at least a year before getting Vista, not to load it on anything but a new computer, and if needing a computer, to get XP Pro on a powerful computer that can handle vista later (2 MB Ram, 2.33GHz duo core, 160MB+ Hard Drive) and wait until all compatability issues are resolved and verification that all of your software is compatible with Vista.  You can always upgrade to Vista later with and it will likely be well woth the wait."
"So the last time I've purchased a MS Office was in 2003, so it's been a while since I've updated everything.  The look and feel of Office 2013 is a lot more streamlined and simplified, even though it has a busy look to it (I think because they've changed the screens to almost all white and made the buttons bigger).  So far I've found it has streamlined well, transitioning and updating itself fluidly.  Excel has a new look when updating a cell, showing at the same time the cells that it is updating at the same time with a quick downward motion of the numbers.  Outlook creates reply emails straight in the email without opening a new screen, making for quicker and easier use.  The icon on the taskbar displays a small envelope when you have mail, which is a nice touch.

I think the only major con is the horrible DRM that they have on it.  Originally they made it so that you could install only once.  Your computer crashes too bad.  They switched it once the outcry was loud enough so that you can re-download every 90 days, which is better but still not good.  What if I install and computer crashes, then I have to wait 90 days, all the while not being able to use the programs (this was the last I had heard of the DRM, so if MS has changed it again please let me know).  That being said I will be keeping my 2003 handy just in case I need it in a pinch.

All in all, DRM aside, this Office feels and works really well.

4 stars."
"Been using TurboTax for years, always works well, easy to transfer previous years data into program, saves time and money."
"Unlike Windows ""CRASH"" Millenium, Windows XP PRO seems to work and contain the back end ""stuff"" you need to build sites, connect them to back end data sources, mess around with Perl and other web technologies.
It is likely to render some of your hardware and software inoperable until you get new software and drivers.  So far, the Canon Scanner doesn't work, Roxio's CD creator (as mentioned by another reviewer) requires an $80.00 upgrade to work, drivers for the Creative sound card had to be installed 3x, the latest version of WinAmp died for a while, and there may be more.  After a couple days, it's only had one crash that the computer seemed to think was serious enough to contact Microsoft about.
XP Home will work for the average surfer/graphics/HTML/Office user, but beyond that, Pro is necessary.  So far, it does seem like a big leap in reliability and functionality from anything I've used in the past - 3.1, 95, 98, & ME.  Though its too early to tell, the rating might need to go up a star or two if it doesn't start to implode after its been used for a while.
The color scheme in the interface changed to what looks like some kind of kids playschool theme but the actual layout is very similar to previous versions and doens't take much getting used to.
Just remember, THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ""HOME"" AND ""PRO"" in terms of functionality for those that work on the web and want to do anything that requires PWS or IIS."
"Best popular mag in publication. It's a diabolically entertaining techie/consumer delight. From the paper gauge to the leading edge of print and type that are engineered to deliver the articles, there is simply no other mag that delivers a higher level of eye-popping ""Wow!"" month after month.

March 2018 update: It died. They killed it. It was going so good. Then the mag took political sides and conspiracy."
"I needed this to upgrade an older iMac. The installation worked without a hitch. The installation was easy and went smoothly.

However, be careful if using this for an upgrade. It did a clean install that wiped out all the existing apps, but not data. That was OK for my need, but it could be a serious problem for someone else."
Dominoes is the best
"I ussally purchase anti-virus programs at the store so that I can get a ""cd"" incase I need to boot from it to fix viruses. Found that you can ""make a boot Disk"" from norton's site to boot your PC if needed to clean some of the viruses off that way. Have tested this version with Windows 7 Ult. 64 bit and found it does what is says. Stopped viruses for getting into the system and let's you know what it is and what happened. A must for web browsing today."
"I was unable to get this to complete a whole DVD of content. I wasted almost an entire spool of DVD's. I have given up trying to get this to work. I will probably end up using a service like Stash Space. I have less than 10 tapes that are worthy of converting so it will be worth having a pro do it. I wanted this to work so bad!

I received this product free of charge to try through the vine program.
Would I spend my own money on this? No"
"For those who don't know, WinZip is a file archiver, a way of compressing files for Windows and other operating systems. It has been around since the early 1990s as a GUI (Graphical User Interface) front end for PKZIP, the data compression utility that had been authored by the late Phil Katz. I note this as two people asked me about ZIP files in the last couple months. So much for the brief history lesson.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WinZip-18-Pro/dp/B00GDF83SM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WinZip 18 Pro</a>&nbsp;is the latest version of WinZip, and is a full-featured product, with a lot of good functionality. It does an excellent job opening and extracting ZIP, Zipx, 7Z, LHA/LZH, RAR, BZ2 and about all of the other major compression file formats of which you can think. It makes fast work of converting Microsoft Word docs (and other Office files) to PDF format, and it's easy to create them as read-only PDF if you want to avoid file alteration by other parties.

This version offers more that the older&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WinZip-17-Standard/dp/B009RG41HQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WinZip 17 Standard</a>&nbsp;and other variations in that it makes it easier to protect your privacy and share files in email messages, in social media, and on the cloud. It has been redesigned to support new add-ons, and cloud navigation makes it simpler to protect, manage and share your files online. An updated Zip engine makes even smaller ZIP and Zipx files.

Now you can display photos within ZIP files without extracting them by using WinZip's internal image viewer, and you can use the 'Photos' button to rapidly transfer photos from supported cameras and iPhones, then rotate and compress them into picture shows for sharing. Among the new features, you can use direct access to cloud services. These include Google Drive, SkyDrive (now Cloud Drive), and Dropbox, which I've tried successfully. You can also access other cloud services such as  Box, CloudMe and SugarSync, though I have not tried these. You can also send links to your cloud files via instant messaging, email and social media with the Cloud Links feature.

If you have a large number of digital images on your hard drive, it will reduce your .JPG files by about 20 to 25% with no loss of photo quality or data integrity. Photographers with a large number of images should note that WinZip may (or may not) cause some issues with image management/viewing applications such as Adobe Photoshop Lightroom or Nikon ViewNX 2, so run some tests before you try to compress all of your images. I have not tried compressing RAW images, as keeping them intact is a personal thing.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WinZip-18-Pro/dp/B00GDF83SM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WinZip 18 Pro</a>&nbsp;is available here on CD-ROM or as a PC download for Windows 7, Vista and Windows 8.x. If you have a Kindle Fire or Android device, the freebie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WinZip/dp/B008CPRLP2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WinZip</a>&nbsp;app works quite well, with excellent compatibility. Users of the WinZip 17 versions may or may not wish to go for this new version; it's a personal choice depending on what features you want. Both versions do their job well, have a good interface, and are extremely handy for taking advantage of cloud storage.

"For those unaware, the Rosetta stone philosophy is to learn a language the way a baby learns. No grammar, no lessons, etc. Just immerse the student in the language the way a baby is immersed. To be honest, I wasn't aware of that philosophy when I decided to try this out.
The technique is certainly interesting. They do a good job of showing you pictures many times and making you pronounce the word. This package comes with a mic and headphone, although I only used the mic. But when you speak back, the software tells you how well you pronounced the word. That's pretty neat. But occasionally it can get annoying if you think you've pronounced the word correctly and it still says you haven't! For each word they also have a training session so that you can practice just the pronunciation of that word.
One other 'feature' that I didn't like was that they always take you through a review when you start a new session (after having previously finished a session and then closed the software). There is a way to disable that review, but they'll always remind you about it later on and mark it as remaining to do!
In all fairness, if the goal is to learn a language, this software does a good job of that. Just don't expect to learn it quick. It is meant to take a long time, just as a baby takes a long time to eventually communicate with others. But the point is, at the end, you will be able to communicate!"
"I can unequivocally say this product is solely responsible for the slow and painful death of my computer.  I use Windows XP Pro on a self built machine with quality components.  I would consider myself an 'above average' computer user, but ran into problems with Kaspersky that I and their technical support staff are unable to fix.  The day I hit uninstall and removed this slug from my system was the day everything went back to normal and I feel as if a 50lb weight was lifted.

This product:

1) Takes a ridiculously long time to load at system startup
2) Blocks 30-50% of perfectly safe websites regardless of whether you use MSIE or Firefox
3) Has ""support"" staff that takes days to respond and then gives the standard generic responses you would have already found in the help file
4) Tends to mark any incoming mail as spam if you don't use Outlook for your email client
5) Continues to interfere with your system and web browsing even if you have disabled security
6) Continues to interfere with your system even if you have exited the program completely
7) Is no longer top-rated in virus detection according to av-comparatives
8) Is mind-numbingly slow when scanning your computer for viruses
9) Consumes a tremendous amount of resources while scanning instead of working silently in the background
10) Takes a long time to update due to very slow transfer rates
11) Does not include a comprehensive guide in the retail box.  Just a CD and a lot of wasted cardboard.
12) Slows web surfing to a crawl assuming the sites aren't blocked entirely.

I'm tired of dealing with these people.  I had the exact same problem with their previous version (7.0) and it drove me nuts.  I couldn't even access Kaspersky's website to complain, their software blocked me!  Shutting off and disabling various services like the firewall or online scanner does no good.  The past couple of months v7.0 seemed like it was working correctly.  Against my better judgment I updated to this version and have regretted it.  I just can't rate this program low enough.  For the record, since I uninstalled surfing is a breeze.  Now I need to find an antivirus and firewall solution that works."
"I was moments away from purchasing this at a retail store even though the only feature I really wanted was the ability to burn HD-format video onto a standard DVD (obviously with less time per disc due to the much smaller storage size). This was the number-one touted feature on the box (and on the Amazon website). I didn't have my reading glasses with me and almost missed the itty-bitty 2-point type down at the bottom that said that this feature was only available with a separate purchase of a special plug-in only available from Roxio. What the crud? This is SOFTWARE, not a mechanical device... if the software doesn't support the feature it advertises, then IT""S NOT A FEATURE... the plug-in is a separate software product and they should not be able to advertise it as part of the parent application! This is one of the most misleading cheats I've ever seen. At least on the web-site they don't hide it in 2-point type, you just have to follow the asterisks. If it's still worth it to you, and you don't mind rewarding deceptive marketing practices, the plug-in is available at the Roxio web site for twenty bucks extra. Let me know how it works, cuz' I ain't buying it."

"I have been using LT for a couple months now, and more than happy with everything it offers, and everything it doesn't.  The simple statement here is that if you do not need to render in 3D, LT is for you. As it is for me.

Let's face it, LT is a step down, but for the money, it is quite the bargain for the steps it takes for you.  Either way you look at it, you are playing with the big wigs because you can now speak their language.  With full DWG compatibility, you are able to associate yourself and others with the most popular file format.  If you are dealing with people with limitations, you are the one with the ability to provide previous formats for them to utilize, not the other way around. With LT you can use anything.  And if the people you are providing any of this for have nothing remotely possible to use any of your creations, well, you simply export a PDF version.

For my needs, it is above and beyond exceeding my expectations. Do a comparison of your needs, and if you can live without 3D models, and 2D will work, this is a great deal, from a long-time trusted maker, with the best service."
"I have bought the paper version of this magazine for years, but I have to say this was a bit disappointing. A LOT of advertising versus articles. It should be free if its only advertising."
daughter loves them
Good fit even after washing in hot water to force shrinking. I have a 30 inch inseam and 34 waist and got a medium size. Note that these sweatpants are very thick so not good for warm climates. Good quality and great price.
Excellent way to give a gift to someone that lets them select exactly what they want. Fast and secure service.
In the current version it  does not have what I am looking for  in malware protection. I will but the full version
"I found lots to like about Corel's WordPerfect Office X4.  And, speaking as an unhappy employee forced to use WordPerfect back in the Dark Ages, I can attest to the improvements that Corel has made in this suite of Office applications.  Here are a few of the pros and cons of this program as I've experienced them:

PROS:

WordPerfect X4 is easy to use, and it is easier to manage my blog with text from WordPerfect than with text written in Word 2007.

Same with Quattro X4 - easy to use, fast-running.  No complaints here.

WordPerfect Office X4 comes with a tutorial video that shows you how to do all manner of interesting things with your office suite.  I've only completed half of it, and I've already learned some new time-saving tricks.

I've used the PDF maker to great advantage, and I'm very pleased with the results. I also appreciate not having to buy Adobe Acrobat yet again.

CONS:

WordPerfect is designed to work with documents from every conceivable word processor.  Ahem - isn't that a bit of overkill, or could it perhaps be managed during program installation so that my computer doesn't have to host such a big program?

WordPerfect Lightning was a big problem for me.  It did not work and play well with the rest of the programs on my computer.  I finally uninstalled it because it popped up unexpectedly and interfered with my ongoing work.

I have yet to try the month's free trial of Corel's Visual Intelligence, but I can report that it is a subscription-based service.  Every year you get to pay again, and, somehow, that rubs me the wrong way.  I'll buy a program (I know, I know, I'm only leasing it), but I don't want to buy the same program over and over every year.  So I consider this feature, which may in fact be very good, to be a pain.

Overall, I find more pros than cons with WordPerfect Office X4.  It's not perfect, but, as a regular user for two months, I've found that it meets my needs most of the time.  I won't be going back to Microsoft Office.

Three and  stars!"
"If you have a newer Samsung Android smartphone such as a Galaxy Note 3 or Galaxy S4, there's a built-in security feature called KNOX that will more than likely conflict with prominent anti-virus or internet security app. These security apps require administrative access for features such as remotely wiping the phone and activating the camera. Though intentional, KNOX will probably refuse such access. There have been several documented cases of this conflict on the S4.

Non-Samsung devices may have similar safeguards which may also be incompatible.

Please try the Kaspersky Lab Internet Security LITE version for free before purchasing. In fact, you should try the free version of any security app you are considering before purchasing the full version. That's why the free trials are available. :-)"
very happy with purchase
Good investment
"Well, I don't know how it does on new computers, but I installed this on my older version HP and I've had nothing but problems.  Now I can't get my printer to work, and other programs are having a lot of problems.  I wish I would never had installed this thing.  The computer was fine before I tried this.  I don't know if it was this program, or if I got a virus by chance at the same time--but I'm now very disgusted."
"Imported my ancestry work without any problems and I got to work. I loved how well it worked with Ancestry.com and I found it easy enough to navigate around, find problems, or find certain relatives. I'm convinced to get a newer version before continuing more."
Love this mag
been subscribing to this for years= it's a must if you like fashion!
Not bad but not much better
"I have Office 2013 on my home PC, but I needed one for my laptop.  Enter Office 2016.  Installation was super easy.  I simply opened the trial version of Office on my laptop and entered the key number from the card.  That automatically sent me to the Office site for installation.  I hit the install button, which didn't take long at all.

2016 primarily uses OneDrive, which is cloud-based.  I need that, because my laptop has an SSD, not a lot of memory.  As soon as I opened up 2016, the files from OneDrive popped up.  After downloaded my file, I discovered collaborative editing wasn't going to work because Office 2013 doesn't have that feature.  I could read only or merge.  It also saves files to my computer, so when I hit the save button, the file went to my computer instead of the cloud.

Overall, I like Microsoft Office better than LibreOffice.  My kids use LibreOffice because I don't want to splurge on Microsoft Office for their computers.  LibreOffice is fine for light word processing, but it doesn't work nearly as smoothly as Microsoft Office. If working on  word processing software is your job, spring for Microsoft Office."
"Corel PaintShop Pro X6 Ultimate bridges the gap between photoshop elements and full-blown photoshop at a price competitive with the former. PSP X6 Ultimate is a full-featured photo editing program that is powerful, and supports 64-bit systems, while still having a 32-bit only .exe available if you need to use plug-ins that are only 32-bit compatible. The editing program runs much more stable than the X3 version it replaced for me, making for a stable editing experience with little fear of a crash-to-desktop in the middle of an editing session. Many of the advanced editing features require a small learning curve, but luckily these features are all well documented, making understanding them effortless. Overall, the interface is very well laid out, the various tools and toolbars are intuitively laid out, and navigating the editing program is second-nature. Corel PaintShop Pro X6 Ultimate is an excellent, well-rounded photo editing program that is just as friendly for the novice as it is powerful for the seasoned professional."
"Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X8 was easy to install and stable on my Windows 7 laptop.  I have never found Corel programs to be particularly intuitive or user-friendly, and Video Studio Ultimate X8 is no exception to that rule.  However, if you're willing to put in the time and effort and work with it, you will probably find yourself pleased and impressed with what you're able to create with it.  There are plenty of free tutorials to get you started.

If you aspire to get creative with your videos, this package has enough special effects to give your home movies some extra impact.

Recommended."
"At the risk of inverting priorities, let me begin this review with a word of disclosure about the reviewer:

I love travel, am on the road half the time for professional reasons, travel to all the continents, have lived on three of them for extended periods of time, and nurture a quiet reservation about people who 'get to know' faraway places by the convenience of a short visit to an affluent resort.

However, I have also seen both the good that tourism has done for local economies and the blinkered understanding of the world too often suffered by those who cannot or choose not to travel. So my reluctance should not be construed as resentment.

OK, enough of that. Given these caveats about high-end travel, Cond Nast can be a fascinating read. Some of it ('Escape from the Airport. Passenger power saves the day', Dec 2006) is valuable for air travelers on almost any budget.

Yet the *real* value of this magazine will be mined by those whose circumstances allow them to travel anywhere they want. For that kind of affluent tourist, Cond Nast can be a gold mine of opportunities that would otherwise be overlooked.

In my judgement, TRAVEL AND LEISURE beats CONDE NAST TRAVELER by a nose in this sector's competition, but either one will do you. If you had, say, five years of high-end travel in front of you, you'd do well to toss in some coins for subscriptions to both.

Frequent travelers on a business or economy budget are likely to hold out for browsing in the dentist office waiting room or - as I do - snagging subscriptions to both via frequent flyer miles.

Bon voyage!"
I consider a shea butter soap a guilty pleasure.  When you're used to purchasing soap in 8-bar bricks at Costco for a bottom-line price  having a huge bar of gentle sudzing Girley soap in your tub is a luxury. Im also enough of a 60s hippy that I have a soft spot for Patchoule.  This soap is gentle to the skin and leaves you feeling soft and subtle.  I LOVE this product.
"I have tested and used every major brand of internet projection. I just finished reviewing a similar package from Webroot. While this AVG suite of protection doesn't cover as much different programs, it does what it should better and is much easier to recommend because of it. You install this and basically sit back knowing you are protected for most things without becoming a computer major or having to slow your computer down a huge amount.

Being a computer ""nerd"" AVG is what I install on friends and family's computers. Nuff said."
I have really sensitive skin therefore never was able to use any type of scrub all my life.  But a friend advice me to try this one because my skin started to smell pretty bad during certain  times of the month.  Causes no irritation and I was able to use it everyday.  Seems to get rid of the oily smell from my face.
"Norton Security with Back Up has worked ""OK"" for me so far. Installation was very easy and took only a matter of minutes. Inside the box is a little card with a serial number. Log in online and download the software. It did automatically uninstall the previous norton antivi from my computer in order to install this one. The first thing I noticed that was weird with this version is this weird floating bar thing it does on occasion. If it asks you to install to norton to your status bar, say no. I had to turn off that feature. I do notice it back every now and then which is super annoying. I have to ability to install and run the software on 10 pieces of technology. I don't quite have 10 but I can sure use the extra protection. I have yet to attempt doing that as my phone is old an in need of replacement (Skyrocket Galaxy S2 I got when they were brand new) which will happen in the next month. When I replace the phone then I will update this review. Everything else worked great. The only problem I have is that weird floating bar that I do not like. It will go away but it is annoying. Also, it asks me to set up a password vault, so far I have not figured out how to make that go away without me being reminded everytime I start up my laptop. I do not need service. Seems good for the price."
"I tried again and again to get this software installed on my Windows 8 desktop by all normal means and it just wasn't going to happen. The CD just would not run. I was eventually able to install portions of this software by opening them up, one-by-one, by exploring the disc files. I had to install them in bits, and even that wasn't entirely successful. I could not get ALL of this product installed on my computer, so I was only able to try out portions of it. Though what I did get installed does seem to be working, the experience of installing it was just too frustrating for me to be able to recommend this product to others."
"I switched to Norton after a decade + with Trend Micro, and I'm not really happy with the switch.

It is, of course, difficult to tell how well any security program is working without intentionally visiting infected sites, which I'm not about to do.  So I'm operating on the assumption that Norton is detecting viruses and spyware as well as Trend, though I have no way of being sure.

My problem with Norton is that it makes everything else run very slowly.  Outlook, in particular, takes forever to open and programs frequently hang.  I have an older PC desktop running Windows 7, but it handles most software without noticeable delay -- or at least, it used to.

Norton also lets a surprising number of pop-ups get through, which Trend never did.  I never realized how many of these Trend actually caught, until it was gone.

All in all, unless someone running tests on Norton verifies that it does a much better job than other programs at catching the nasties, I can't recommend it."
"So far, so good at this writing.  Installed easily on my XP machine.  Replaced Vipre, which wouldn't upgrade and technical support was no help.  Not the memory hog Vipre was."
I have used Kaspersky Internet Security on my computers for many years now. It does provide adequate security.
"It works well - it removed a trojan from my old Year 2007 Celeron Laptop and they claim that they keep their virus signature updated.

My only grip is with the performance.  My old laptop was running Kaspersky (Free edition) and the performance impact was acceptable, but the moment I installed Avira - it slowed down things.

Another thing which I did not like is the fact that they updated my browser home page and installed a toolbar.  CNET does stuff like that, but never expected a packaged software like this to behave so badly."
"My brother, son, and husband were quite pleased to get one of these.  Will order these as gifts again next year."
"Windows ""upgrades"" are WORSE THAN USELESS.

I had to buy Windows 8 with my new tablet, and it is absolute trash-much harder to even access your desktop than with Windows 7, and it keeps slamming unwanted applications onto the screen when I try to access my desktop. Very user unfriendly.

When I had to get Windows 7 with a new computer, several programs I owned--including the rather costly Corel PhotoPaint--would not work. In other words, Microsoft essentially destroyed a couple of hundred dollars worth of software for me. The operating system has bugs too, e.g. when I try to select a default program to run a certain type of file, the ""always use this program"" box is grayed out.

Microsoft Office ""upgrades"" also are like throwing money down a sewer. The 2010 version of Excel does not do anything substantially different than the XP version, and actually has less functionality in terms of importing other kinds of files (e.g. Quattro Pro) than the XP version. The last thing I want to do is get Windows 8 or higher and then discover that Quattro Pro, which I have to use for my financial records (because I can't import the files in Excel) won't work any more. There are other problems as well, e.g. ""Search my computer"" NEVER works for the Help function in Office. It is clear that Microsoft is running on name recognition only rather than the quality of its products."
Nice software to copy disks.  Easy to use
"You put the call-in line of your local rock station on speed dial on your office phone, cell, and your vacationing cube-mate.  Every time you hear the magic tone, you jump and try, try to be the 95th caller.  Finally, it happens-and you have an ""All Access"" pass to see Springstein!  You arrive at the concert, and find out that ""All Access"" means third row, far, far right, obstructed view...no jamming with the Boss tonight!

That's how you'll feel if you buy McAfee's All Access protection.  All Access, except for iPads, Macs, and all but one of your computers (most virus programs are licensed for three computers).

Incidentally the program works fine, although (like other McAfee products) there is too much in the way of pop-ups reminding me that the virus definitions have been updated.  I give it two stars because of the high pricing and that the ""All Access"" is basically an empty phrase."

"I have been using NIS for a few years now.  I really liked the 2004 version and have had no major problems with it other than once my computer boots, I always had to go into NIS properties to see if my EMAIL SCANNING said 'ON' or 'ERROR'.  Evidently, something on my computer will occassionally cause the email scanning to not load properly, so if it showed 'ERROR' - I would have to reboot and then it would be ok.  I should point out that Norton Support Staff told me even though email scanning said 'error', the computer is still protected by the 'auto-protect' feature if it is turned on.  Minor inconvenience, but other than that, I was very happy with the program.

The same holds true for the new 2005 - I still have the occassional email scanning 'error', but there are a few new  irritating things happening.  While the software works fine, it has tremendously SLOWED DOWN the launch of Outlook Express and it even hangs a second or two when I close it.  Also, if you open NIS properties screen, when I am finished, I hit the X button to close, but it takes like 2-3 seconds before it will close.  Even though these are just a few seconds, it really irritates me because I have a very fast computer.

However, something that really excites me about this new NIS is that the hard drive scan of all files by Norton Anti-Virus seems to take a lot less time than it did with a previous version.  Being a stickler for speedy computer processing, this is definitely a plus.

So, overall, this program works OK and keeps me protected, but I still think there are minor issues they need to work on as mentioned and I also think that the average computer user is not given enough information about whether to allow certain things when a firewall warning appears.  I know so many people that have blocked innocent programs and found that they are unable to use them or get on the internet.  There should be a way for NIS to know what is innocent and what should be blocked... the average computer user doesn't have the time to research what they should block or not - in fact, isn't that the reason we use computers?  They are supposed to be able to do the work FOR US!!!!"
"I got this to wipe out my hard drive on my pc, but it is instead to clean the registry.  The description was not clear enough.

"This is ten copies of Norton Internet Security with 1 year subscriptions. And I like the antivirus product. But I thought the small business part would have more management options. It's currently more expensive than buying the Norton internet security other ways sadly! A 1 user 3 install version is hovering around 30 schmucks which is only ten schmucks per install. Really I give five stars to the Norton Internet security and 2 stars to the ""small business part"".

The pros:
-Norton internet security is really at the top of it's game--another kick ass award from Maximum PC in the latest issue. The Norton internet security itself is a 5 star product to me! It's not the old slow Norton from a few years ago. So very good virus protection!
-Allows you to send emails to your employees that let them install the product.
-let them install the product without them needing a key. It's a little more convenient than managing 3 install keys or single install keys. With the three install keys and the single install keys you have to give the key to each person and to get them under the same Norton account you need to give them the account and password. Here they just get a link and once they run the download they just need to click next a few times--automatically activates!
-You can also have auto-renewal and it says it automatically updates to the newest version. There is definitely some convenience in not having to worry about buying and updating.

Cons:
-no management other than the installation management. They totally missed the ball by not having some connected features! In the account I should be able to see when computers last got updates and what threats have been found. The Norton website for the product says ""manage protection for your company from one convenient Web portal"" so I was expecting more. Only making the install easier is making a day one issue better. The day to day issue with antivirus is needing to go computer to computer to see threats and see if it's being updated, etc. It should at least be able to alert the managing account with an email when a bigger threat occurs!
-the iphone option is a joke. And the fact that it takes one of your installations is ridiculous.

As fewer and fewer small offices have servers, managed endpoint protection is no longer a viable option. Norton could have really started a corner on the new small business just by allowing some admin oversight. But as it is it's just an overpriced antivirus installer."

"My ""go to"" shampoo for my blonde foiled hair. The only other product I'll use aside from Pureology.  Warning to new users, don't leave in too long or it will blue your hair and wait one week before using on newly highlighted hair."

"I'm a computer software person, but I don't have a lot of experience with editing photographs beyond occasionally playing around with a new software package for fun. I got this as a review copy, and I had fun using it to edit a bunch of photographs from a trip I took to an NFL training camp.

I was surprised by how rich the feature set was, given the price point this is at compared to some other software that I've tried. The explanations of some of its features aren't quite as clear as I'd have liked, but they certainly do make an effort to offer plenty of information on how it all works.

For budget photo editing software, this is an excellent option. For people who just want to occasionally resize or crop an image, this is a lot more complicated than what you need."
"I love the updates in iphot0 that do geotagging either by automatic download if your camera is capable or by manuel insertion if not.  You can always definately remember where a picture was taken.

The faces feature is also cool too.  It does take some time for the computer to learn but it does a very good job.  I love being able to look up someone's name and instantly see the pictures that i have of that person on the computer.

iphoto also updated its editing feature.

I have played a little with imovie but not enough to really comment on the differences.

Is it worth the price?  For me, only because i use iphoto for all of my photos.  If it weren't for that, it wouldn't be worth the price.  the other thing i wonder is will there be an ilife '10 and is it better to wait on that?  It is certainly a delimma, but in the end, i chose ilife 09 because of the faces feature, better editing features and geotagging."
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:
 Somewhat recommended, with reservations and only lukewarm fuzzies.

You get a basic set of common photo editing functions packaged in an easy-to-use program, albeit one that runs slowly and carries a lot of overhead with it.  Installation of the software seemed to take forever (it felt like I was installing a whole suite of software!).  And perhaps because of all that overhead, the software as a whole runs pretty slow.  The user interface is slick and nicely designed.  The idea audience for this package is people new to graphics editing who take pictures with point-n-shoot cameras.  This product might even rank as 4 stars for those novices who are very new to photo editing.  But even for those people, I wonder how many of them would wish that they had more features after a few months of using this."
"I'll be honest: I don't play a lot of BDs on my PC because I have a decent BD player, and my desktop isn't the place where I usually end up watching movies. That said, I have to express my belief that CyberLink has somewhat improved their PowerDVD Ultra suite since previous versions, and if you're in need of a good media software suite, CyberLink's is something to consider.

Not only does it handle the disc-based media, but it also scans for local media on your hard drives, and plays back just about everything. I was a tad disappointed with their movie title and information detection-- The CyberLink version just isn't as good at it as those devices and apps that search the IMDB or TMDB, frequently getting titles, descriptions, and box art wrong. This is because they use their own service instead of relying on the established ones on the Internet, and it translates to being a weakness in their software. I had to fix a lot of movies' info after the software did its initial scans.

The 3D conversion seems spiffy, but if I'm honest I'm not a fan of 3D movies, and so all I can really say is that it did seem to work to some degree, but that your mileage may vary. Some movies work better than others.

CyberLink is fairly generous with cloud offerings, and they play nice with DLNA. No complaints here.

However, the software did run a little slow at times, and I'm sure these times were when PowerDVD was connecting online... It seems like many actions in PowerDVD require it to check something online, and that bogs it down a bit.

Playback is clean, crisp, and as you'd expect of commercial media software. However, as noted it starts up a bit slow, and I really didn't see any major advantages over freeware like VideoLan when it comes to local media in various formats.

CyberLink PowerDVD's best feature is its ability to play Blu-ray Discs on your Windows PC, because Microsoft doesn't include that ability in the Windows OS (licensing, etc. prevents it). If you're a laptop warrior and need to play BDs while traveling, CyberLink PowerDVD is probably your best option. It handles menus, sub-menus, added features, BD Live, and all the other functions you've come to expect of the BD format.

So my final rating; Three stars for a desktop PC where BD playback is secondary to your needs, but that bumps up to four stars if you're in need of decent BD playing suite for your laptop.  The two stars I docked were for the poor data matching for movies, and for the slower loading speeds."
I've used H&R Block for years without any major issues.
"I have loved this magazine for many years and have a nice collection of issues from both my on/off subscription years and one-off bookstore purchases. Even though you can supposedly find out anything and everything on the internet, including on the CI website, I still refer back to these magazines for tips, hints and recipes.

The recipes in the magazine are especially expanded upon in ways that I don't always find in the CI books or annuals. I also like the ratings of gadgets and explanations of ""what is it?"" as far as older or obscure kitchen items. The illustrations are clear and very helpful in teaching proper techniques like trussing poultry for example. Beginning cooks will appreciate the foolproof qualities and encyclopedic explanations of the recipes, and seasoned cooks will likely tweak tried and true recipes for even better results.

I always know I can trust the recipes to come out right when working from my CI collection. Very pleased to recommend.

"We've used various versions of QuickBooks in our law practice for several years and have found this line to be effective and problem free.  The upgrade to 2013 went smoothly for us and the new look seems cleaner and less cluttered.  It has been easier to train personnel on this version since the interface is more intuitive than before.  While there are always some glitches and hitches in any software, QuickBooks is as functional as any competing software."

"For industries and workflows that are designed around CorelDraw, particularly those in the professional print industry, this bellwether continues to offer tremendous backwards compatibility, useful features and an intuitive UI. The Windows experience is much better with multi-core and native 64-bit support (finally!). On older hardware CorelDraw was known for being fairly sluggish but now on most modern desktops and laptops you shouldn't even notice.

In terms of overall value and intuitive functioning I find CorelDraw to be solid but not amazing.

"I have many years like IT consultor and Norton is not the only answer to destroy infections, there are something else that Norton can't detect.
Unfortunately, Symantec is losing their quality in its products, is a shame that AntiVirus like Norton don't take the opinion of his customers. Nowadays Norton only detects Virus but not the ""Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUP)"", for this last, you need Malwarebytes or other antimalware software. Then finally you need to buy two or more licenses of other companies to close the breach. Finally the customer support take the easy way to repair its software like uninstall without consider your custom settings, if you did a complex set up, then better resign yourself to losing it, because they uninstall without consider that."
as advertised
Very satisfied.
It took me some time but I completed it. I can now have a conversation in Spanish without feeling like I am a dumb tourist. I will take ti again just o refresh and get the sentence structure down but I am holding onto it and not giving it to anyone else. They can buy their own.

"I purchased a new laptop and it came with Vista and 60 day trial of Norton Internet Security 2007.  Because I am a registered user of a previous version of Norton products I received an offer directly from Symantec to buy Norton 360, 3 PC version for less than the Amazon price even with purchase of the download-for-a-year capability.

The good:

- The download and install of the product went smoothly in about 20 minutes.

- The protection is very broad and covers all the typical types of assaults.

- The controls are easy to manage and tweak.

The bad:

- After the download, whenever I go to PayPal the logon is prevented because the browser think's PayPal's security certificate has been revoked.  Both PayPal and Symantec blame Microsoft, but it worked okay before 360 and it works fine on the Vista desktop I have protected by Live OneCare.  The workaround is temporarily suspend anti-phishing protection, which 360 makes easy.

- 2 days after purchasing the software I went online to load Norton 360 on my second desktop.  The site rejected my order number as invalid.  When I logged in to the Symantec site, it shows I have an active license but doesn't show I have any orders.  After 4 attempts I finally got a response from the Symantec email support team.  It was obvious they hadn't read the details of my problem, only the header.  They gave me the link to put in my order number to download, but of course that is the problem.  The note also warns I shouldn't contact them about the same problem again for 7 days.  I guess I could use my dime and queue up for who knows how long on their phone response support, but that doesn't seem cost effective for less than $50, especially when the result may be the same.  I have contacted the email support team again, no response at this point.  So I am less than a week into a 3 computer license with a year of download protection with only one copy working and no way to get the other copies.  If they do not respond by the time my credit card statement comes I am cancelling the software payment and will unload the software.

I have happily used Symantec products in the past but was never reduced to using their download service or online support.  It appears ignorance is bliss as my experience with the service and support is that they are extremely poor.  So if you do want to try this product I strongly suggest staying away from Symantec's online store and get the CD.  This should reduce the probability of problems and needing to interact with Symantec itself."
Crashed my computer when I tried to  install it. Some wierd comment about  Microsoft Dot-Com error. Had to reinstall windows to correct problem. I have used this product for years with no problem.
"Utility software is not exciting, and it either does the job or it doesn't.  This does the job of zipping and unzipping without a lot of fuss.  I like it for that."

"Other reviewers below have done A great job of listing all the features of the program so I will focus on my experience learning to use the PhotoDirector 5 Ultra.

I had never used a program like this before because I didn't cherish the idea of learning all the ends and outs of a program such as Photoshop. As I progressed in my photo taking abilities, I needed more than just the programs on my laptop or those that came with my Cannon Rebel EOS.

There was a learning curve for me and not quite as intuitive as others reviewed here. (Perhaps I should mention I'm 58 years old and new to a camera beyond a point and shoot.) However, I found the tutorials and handbook that came with the program to be quite helpful. Learning came much quicker once I found the these. Go to  [...]
For a rookie photographer (who LOVES her hobby of taking pictures and takes hundreds at a time) who needed a not-too-complicated but full-of-options, this is a match!  The price is right."
"Yeah, it does the job well for Federal returns, less well for state returns - there are a couple of esoteric things you need to do for yourself for Maryland returns.
This year Intuit made it harder to switch between forms and the guided interview, and they've changed versions so you pretty much have to go for a more expensive package than you did last year.  Despite the outcry, this outrageous bit of market milking will stick - unlike their previous attempt to charge you for filing more than one or two Federal returns.
Monopolies are not good for consumers and there's no telling what ingenious way Intuit will come up with next year to make us pay more for less, so it is probably time to consider other packages next year."
"Let some stuff in including a Trojan, will change this year"
"Omnipage 18 installed quickly and easily on Windows XP. It seems as reliable as past OCR software that I've used (Paperport and TextBridge), but didn't seem significantly faster or more accurate in detecting characters. It faithfully flags any characters that it doesn't recognize or that may be an issue and lets you accept or change as needed. In about 16 pages scanned out of a dictionary-type book, the software questioned about 5 character groups per page, nearly all requiring changes, showing that the software accurately flags things it doesn't fully recognize. It made a couple of errors in recognition, but the test sample was pretty challenging. It does have a ""learning"" mode, so it should show improvement as you work with it, but I couldn't tell much difference from the start to the finish of my project. If you don't have OCR software, Omnipage 18 should work well for you, but if you are looking for a major upgrade over Paperport or Textbridge, I recommend keeping what you have."
"I got a new notebook recently that had this on it. I almost returned the machine because EVERYTHING on it was so slow. I mean everything ... apps ... web page response, Settings. It was ridiculous.

Then I had a wild idea ... what if the AV was the problem. I uninstalled McAfee and the machine started to fly. So I put one of my AVG licenses on it. There was very little performance degradation with AVG.

McAfee might be a great AV software, but if I can't stand to use the computer with it installed, it is worthless to me."
"To be honest, I had never even heard of Avira Internet Security, but seeing I had an opportunity to give it a whirl, I decided to give it a try.

I was surprised just how easily everything went. The installation was a breeze for me, I've had problems with other programs in the past during installation.

So far, so good. I have tried all the scans and it appears that everything is working smoothly. I am very happy with it right now and it looks like it's doing it's job correctly!"
Still getting used to the program upgrades
"Installed the Lantronix USB device server in 10 minutes, just connected to ethernet, installed software, and plugged in devices. I am using it with an epson scanner and an HP Officejet K60- which is supposed to be (acording to hp) non-compatible with a wireless network. I bought this with the expectation it probably wouldn't work with the HP but it did! wireless connection is great- entire network has full control over devices on other side of house, 2 ports left for any other devices I wish to network, couldn't be happier this product was worth the price for me.

Update: When DSL signal is low or reset, device server sometimes needs to be reconnected or reset as well - usually this is just a matter of disconnecting power and usb devices then reconnecting but sometimes pressing the pinhole reset button is required. It can be annoying but it's mostly attributed to my poor dsl signal, other than that still works great, still highly recommend!"
"They make you log in all the time now to do anything with your local data and account. I don't use anything online related to this and do not want to and never would. I deeply resent that they require you to login to your account all the time to update, see your data, etc.  If there were any other serious product available, they'd be out of business."
"I do enough graphics work that I need a good editor. I really like PhotoShop but it now can only be leased, expensively, an expense that can go on forever.

I have had versions of PaintShop when it was by Jasc. I didn't care for the bloat when Corel took it over. It seems to be better now.

I really haven't given this baby a thorough workout, just some light work as needed. It has a learning curve but seems to follow Photoshop well. I hear that the face filter included here in the Ultimate is really good.

The price cannot be beat compared to Photoshop. Ah, greed. Adobe and Office 365 are not viable for me any longer."
"I have used both Painter 11 and Painter 12 and find these more intuitive to use than Painter Essentials 5, which is essentially a stripped-down version of the full-fledged Painter programs. Painter 11 and 12 have more brushes, more canvas textures, wet background painting, more options and customizations, and a slew of other niceties that Painter Essentials lack. HOWEVER, Painter is also more than 10 times the price of Painter Essentials. PLUS, Painter 11 and 12 are buggy and computer resource intensive. Painter Essentials, on the other hand, is easy on the CPU, has a much smaller memory footprint, is less buggy, and plays very well with Windows 10.

If you're not a graphic artist and simply want to try your hand at digital painting or to use the (very nifty) auto-painting feature, which transforms your photos into very convincing works of art, Painter Essentials is a good way to go. If you can't decide which program is right for you, Corel offers free trials of both programs (direct links provided in the comments section).

I personally like Painter Essentials 5 and think it is very good for what it is. Definitely recommended for the semi-serious digital artist."
Good product.  Wish I could get another copy.
"Webroot reminds me of AVG, but is a bit more streamlined. It does it's work in the background, and seems to do it
very well. I have been a life long Norton user ever since I learned PC-Dos (not ms-dos) from Peter Nortons book (I still have it).
Over the past few years I have been getting more and more frustrated with Norton, and did not totally trust AVG, as it was a bit twitchy.
So far I am pleased with Webroot after dumping Norton antivirus which was becoming too much work.  Windows platforms are hard enough
to maintain without having to deal with antivirus software that you constantly have to update and scan, and comes in to load the latest version, that then asks you to send money when your existing version still has over 300 days to go.
When doing web searches, Webroot will mark each with trusted, questionable, or no markings to let you know whether or not to go there.
Webroot works in the background, and will always come up when you first start your computer to let you know it is working.
After many tries to get an answer from webroot, the people on Amazon finally came up with what I asked: YOU CAN USE ANY UN-USED CD IN ANY YEAR which is much like Norton.
At under $20.00 for 3 PC's, I really can't find a better deal/software, and at this price, what is stopping you from giving it a try.
Addendum: Had a malware attack a couple of days ago and had to do a system restore,  as it would not let me open any of my programs. It has also become more and more unstable as I get within two weeks of subscription renewal; coincidence, I DON'T THINK SO."
"Love that you can download this copy.  Easy program, was able to finish my taxes in a days work, not days.  Will buy again next year."
"I made the exact same mistake with version 4.0 that I did with this version.  Because it was the newest/greatest I picked it up as soon as it came out and it proceeded destroy my system.
I use Win98 SE on a 1gig Athlon with a Toshiba CD-ROM and HP CDRW for those who care.  Ever since installing it I have had conflicts with different devices and problems accessing my CD Rom.  The famed ""blue screen of death"" which was almost a distant memory is now returning on a daily basis.  I tried uninstalling 5.0 and reinstalling 4.0 but whatever the program  did is now permanent in my system.  I then reinstalled Win 98 completely and while the conflicts are gone (from a device manager standpoint), the B.S.O.D. still shows up frequently when either my CD-ROM or CDRW is being accessed.  Short of reformatting my hard drive, I don't think I'm going to rid myself of this nuisance.
I was actually pleased with version 4.0 (after about the 3rd or 4th patch), but this is just inexcusable.  Now I understand many Win2000 users are having problems as well.  XP users are having a nightmare - even with the patches!  Please avoid this software and let this company die.  After trying a number of different competitors, I would recommend the much more stable and less bloated Nero for CD Burning.  You can find more info about it at ...."
"After reading all the reviews I decided to give my take on new ver 12. I have and still use ver 7 on an old celeron computer running Windows ME. I run ver 8 on a 2.6 pentium computer running Windows XP Pro. I built a new machine a couple months ago running a AMD 4400+ X2 running Windows XP Pro. I found that ver 12 installed with no problems and in no more then 15 minutes. I did what was instructed and had closed all other running programs during the install. I also created a restore point using system restore in case there were problems. After installing I took it for a fun test drive. After playing with it, and loving it. I will say that for a regular grandpa that takes hundreds of photos a year of the grandkids. This is one wonderful piece of software. I am using a 19"" Samsung model 906BW LCD monior with the resolution set a the factory recommend 1440X900. No trouble seeing the screen. Using a EVGA 7600 video card with 256mb ram. The computer itself has 2Gb Kingston HyperX PC 3200 DDR. Because some reviewers said the program loaded slowly when opened. I turned on that machine and after it booted I opened the program and timed it. 17 seconds. Yes seconds. So I can only imagine that the ones having trouble with the way the program loads must have a lot of other stuff running at the same time. It took only seconds also to save a picture that I cropped, removed redeye. and resized before saving. With earlier vers I have been able to do some wonderful things to old B&W photos taken back in the early 40's of my father during WWII as well as my mother and older brother and sister. I'm sure this new ver with only make playing around that more fun. If you are new to photo editing I believe you will not be unhappy buying this. The other reason I purchased it was I'll be building another new computer as soon as service pack 1 is released for Windows Visa. And this ver with run under Vista."
Love Norton. Please keep up the great work and always be a leader.
"If you've ever wished you could create beautiful HDR images, this software can make your dreams come true, as it did for me.  I learned about Photomatix Pro from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Improve-Your-HDR-Photography-Improve-Your-Photography/dp/B0048EKIR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Improve Your HDR Photography (Improve Your Photography)</a>by Jim Harmer.  The program is also available on-line at hdrsoft dot com, where you can get a free trial before buying.

This program is extremely easy to use, and once you've taken your three shots with auto-exposure bracketing, or more exposures at your choosing, you just click to upload them, and then follow the on screen choices.  A tripod is certainly necessary for good clean HDR images, but this software is so flexible that it will take your hand-held (slightly off) images, and align them, also fixing any ""ghosting"" from moving trees or shaky images. You can also use single images and apply tone-mapping, which also gives dynamic images.  Simple sliders allow you to tweak your images before saving them.

Your first tries will no doubt prove to be eye-openers, but keep in mind that the best images are the ones that are not ""overdone"" and totally fake looking.  Professionals use this program, and given its simplicity and affordability, so can you.

Gift card for my daughter
Love this soap and this fragrance.
Enjoy reading this magazines. It has info that I want to read about.  Would buy this magazine again.  Good articles.
"This past November and December I bought all gift cards for my teens, hubby, nieces, nephews, etc.  The amazon giftcard is something you can give anyone with an internet connection"
"Good product! Easy to use, very informative."

I have been a long time user of Norton products.  Performance improvements over the Norton 360.
"(I'm an accountant, just a basic accountant- not a trained tax professional.  I was also a programmer back in the dark ages of computers that could barely do more than a calculator can, now)

At first, I did my taxes using spreadsheets.  Later, after using Quicken for keeping my finances, I used TurboTax for many many years.  I have filed all the common forms and many less common schedules since for awhile I had an in-home business.  For a couple of years I tried a less expensive but still good tax preparation software system... it worked fine.

Last year, I tried both the less expensive one and Turbo Tax.  Both worked sufficently well, but Turbo Tax was just a wee bit clearer to understand some ""what if"" issues I was having - couple filing jointly vs couple filing separate, loss of dependent, tax credit for college and possible AMT tax.

So, this year I'm going back to Turbo Tax.  I like the download version - you get it fast.  Plus, if anything happens to my computer I can re-download it to the replacement no matter where I am (that was very useful one year when I unexpectedly spent a week out of town without my computer)!

I'm reserving a 5-star review for what I would consider the best possible user interface for the awful task of preparing your taxes."
Good gift card. Good food. What's not to like?
Right on time and works great
My best friend tax season.
"I have used WP on and off for years its still great, and user friendly. I got a new Pc and needed to upgrade something Im pleased I got this. I have had no problems with this and the price is good. I use it for personal documents as well as school documents and my husband sometimes uses it for work documents. The features are  still great, we are both pleased."
"When I built my first computer recently, I chose Windows Vista Ultimate. I would be lying if I said that I liked this operating system. I have just had too many problems. First, I could not install the drivers for my APU. It's GPU part says that the standard vga adapter failed to start. I had to put an old Geforce 9600 GSO 512 in it. Next, it had several issues with emulating. I get blue screen when ever I try to emulate n64, and gamecube emulating got progressively slower. Instead of being able to run a game at 150% speed, I only get 85% to 100% game speed. I also had problems with installing Directx. Every time I ran the Directx installer, it failed to install. I had to rely on NBA 2k13 to install Directx for me. So now I bought Windows 7 to replace this OS. I recommend that you save time and money, and just go buy Windows 7."
Always happy when people get this
"I have been a Corel VideoStudio user for quite a while, and this latest entry into the ring does not bring a massive set of differences other than that I have noticed it runs much better in Windows 8 and, after the free upgrade, Windows 10. The list of features is long enough that you will HAVE to take some time to read manuals (available only as a PDF) and view some rather good YouTube tutorials.
There are enough features that the enthusiast will not be too overwhelmed, and the templates help a lot. Tweaking the feature set to get a particular effect is possible to your heart's content, but let's not go overboard here: this is meant to be occupy a position between the very basic software and the more advanced, like Sony's Movie Studio Platinum (I think this was named Vegas). To get good, you will need to do some work, and the price point and feature list of VideoStudio Pro 8 is just right for that.
5 stars."
"I've been using Quicken for sometime now and this version is like my previous ""Deluxe"" version with nice improvements. One thing I would like to point out is one can get blank printable checks from other highly qualified vendors at a fraction of the cost for checks from the Quicken folks."
"Took some time to download the key, but works perfectly with Windows10. Has Outlook as well as Excel, Word so email, calendars, record keeping etc easy"
We couldn't live without this software.  It's far better than Parallels desktop because it's more reliable and easier to use for us.  This is a solid product that year after year only gets better. Very highly recommended from an IT family.
"Disgusting! After 5 years in the making, and promises of a super-duper search engine (that they couldn't get to work in the end), this is just creaky non-productive yet indcrediby expensive flash-in-the-pan stuff. I have to rely on Windows to use my business software. For starters, all office machines needed at least 2 GB RAM to run all those decorative see-through windows (who really cares). It's slow, buggy, already needs dozens of fixes and - hopefully - an SP1 release to address the worst. The annoying 'permissions' dialog requires you to sit in front of the computer, particularly if your office is networked; 'activation' is better called 'aggravation' - seems you are stealing their copyrights - and viruses and worms still infest the system because the browser (incrediby, really) was integrated into the operating system, thereby offering a direct pipeline into the kernel innards.

There is no instruction manual other than pages of denial of user rights. Customer service is ""help yourself"" via the (highly technical) Knowlege Base ... you've got to be a bit of a geek to start messing in the registry after digesting those pages of legalese that fully protect the company, but offer no warranties for the hapless consumer.

Enough said - Apple's Bootcamp now lets you install and run both Mac and Win operating systems (go back to XP/SP2!), elegantly executing the occasional Windows program such as Quicken or games. Leopard now is a de facto dual operating system product. Goodbye Bill Gates, hello Steve Jobs!"
Price could be a little bit better but have used it consistently for many years. It could be a little more user friendly.
I used this program because I am comfortable with it.  I can't say if it is any better or worse for anyone else.  I once got a free copy of Turbo Tax after doing my tax return and had enough confidence to not bother to see if the more expensive Turbo Tax produced any different results.  Most of us do not have very complicated tax returns but using a program like this reduces math errors.
"These things are bullet proof and blow the Cisco LinkSys gear out of the water.  If you need the ability for two separate networks to talk to each other (VLANS), This is the switch for you.  If all you need is a simple GigE switch, check out the ProCurve 1400-8 G switch.

The ProCurves are build smarter and do not overheat.  I've burnt through several Linksys Cisco and Dlink switches. These guys serriosuly need to advertise better.  I would have saved 100's if I just purchased a ProCurve to begin with."
"I've used Turbo Tax and Mac-in-Tax since 1990.
This one is by far the easiest that I've used.
I did have one glitch with my State Tax form. I'm retired and I receive a 1099-R instead of a W-2.
In the Michigan State tax form the program defaulted this 1099-R to a public pension. This is a private pension and with the new taxes on pensions in Michigan, I was going to have to pay a large short fall. (Michigan had exempted all pensions in prior years). After a quick check I am now receiving a refund. All 1099-R's should be defaulted privet not public."
"Teenage sleuth Nancy Drew is back and better than ever in her latest case, Danger on Deception Island. This time around Nancy is visiting marine biologist Katie Firestone at her friends request, but things go wrong as usual. Shortly after Ms. Drews arrival at to the San Juan Islands, Katie discovers that her whale watching boat has been vandalized. While Katie makes everything shipshape, Nancy is hot on the trail of the vandals, along with investigating recent burglaries, digging up Snake Horse Harbors past and making friends with a local legend.
Besides Katie, Nancy meets Holt Scotto, fisherman and harbormaster candidate, Jenna Deblin, owner of the Hot Kettle Caf, and Andy Jason, who runs a rival whale watching business and wants to buy Katie out. Add to that strange fish that have been washing up on shore, a string of burglaries, and an eccentric widow who launches messages in bottles into the harbour.
 Danger on Deception Island is the most organic and satisfying of the nine current Nancy Drew games from Her Interactive. Several new additions include bicycling (similar to the motorboat interface used in Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake) and kayaking, WWW access from Nancys trusty laptop and more. The puzzles were excellently integrated into the gaming environment, making use of the Pacific Northwests charms: building sand castles, kayaking sea caves, bicycling the winding coastal roads, exploring a lighthouse, and digging for clams on deserted beaches. Nancy must also help Katie restore her boat to working order. There are several fun activities not necessary to win the game, including fixing sandwiches with some not-so-tasty ingredients (jellyfish, Tabasco sauce, expired mayonnaise, baking soda), building sand castles, and educational games about whales.
As usual, there are two levels of difficulty, Junior and Senior Detective, and there are plenty of hints and help scattered along the way for both levels, including calling the Hardy Boys for tips and clues. There are many educational elements in Deception Island, including informative webpages about nautical terms, wood identification, Morse code, various types of whales and more that are necessary to solve the mysteries. Graphics are gorgeous (including photo overlays during the biking scenes), character modeling is lifelike, music includes rousing sea chanteys and ominous strings reminiscent of Jaws, and voice acting is above average. Sound effects make you feel like you're really standing on a lonely, windswept shore with only the breaking waves and cries of the gulls to keep you company. And you get to interact with a killer whale as well! Keep up the good work, Her Interactive! (Nancys next mystery is Secret of Shadow Ranch.)"
"I have had trouble installing this with my new Windows Vista system.  I'm not sure that this reflects a problem with the software, or something about my Vista setup.  I will update my review if/when I am able to install successfully."
The packaging is adorable. Makes gift giving a snap. I bought 5 different cards so far for Christmas presents. My family is spread all over the East Coast and I'm in Michigan. Postage is so expensive to mail packages. Everyone I know loves Amazon so it's a win - win!! Thank you!

It's also sold at a much cheaper price point. In my opinion it's aimed at the hobbyist , but it can be used by professionals as well.

A plus is that both the Mac and PC versions are included.

"This was a CHRISTmas gift my daughter loved the girt card!  One of her favorite places to shop!
GOD BLESS!"
"Kudos to Amazon.com for fast delivery, beautiful card.... It's all good! This was a gift for a college student in our family who lives on her own struggling to get by. She's reluctant to accept cash, but I know she needs many things. This is the best choice! Books, music, millions of choices on Kindle, snacks, chicken soup, socks... It's all here! She was soooo excited -- really!"
"I've used Trend Micro's Housecall a lot in the past for my online scans or to remove any malware.  Up until now I hadn't ever used their Internet Security software in the past.  I found that it is just as accessible as Housecall.  The windows are sleek and easy to you use.  The scan itself isn't to labor intensive and you can actually use other programs while it is running a full system scan, which I've found is usually my biggest gripe about other Internet Security software.  All in all I would recommend along side other comparable big name Internet Security programs."
"Corel Painter 11
(2009 Edition)
------------------------
I have struggled for months to master this product well enough to review it intelligently, and finally had to give up. This is an extremely powerful graphic tool, but as a layperson (not a graphics design professional) I found the program it very difficult to navigate, as well as to access specific features.  So many tools are built into the Painter suite that it quickly becomes an impenetrable labyrinth; you access one tool and lose the path to dozens of others. If I try out a new feature, just poking around in the tabs and menus, I often find it difficult to backtrack or to find another feature that I want to use.  Even simple stuff like sampling and adjusting colors, then using brushes to apply them (which I am familiar with from Photoshop) has eluded me - Painter frequently seems to ""lock"" each feature into place, and although I realize the problem is that I just don't know how to use the program, I nonetheless find it frustrating that it's so difficult to find the desired solutions.  Like many new software packages, the internal documentation (help menus, toolbars, etc.) is not geared towards lay people -- basic features are not covered, plain English is not used, the approach is technical and high-level professional, with little offered in the way of tutorial or remedial assistance.  I just found it too complicated to use beyond a very basic level, which was disappointing because I would love to use some of the fancier features. Oh, well.  I guess I'll have to shell out a few hundred bucks to take a class or something... Although, really, users shouldn't have to do that.

Better documentation and clearer navigation would be wonderful for this product. Also, perhaps Corel could consider designing this package in ""levels,"" like a video game: new users could select ""basic"" (level one) features and work their way up into more complicated tool as their skill set improves, instead of just being thrown into the deep end, and finding the entire product mystifying and dense. I realize there is a separate, stripped-down version of this program for sale, but I don't see why that basic version couldn't be built into the architecture of the full package, so that non-professionals could work their way up to the full use of what seems to be an amazing product. Perhaps these comments with help Corel with future upgrades. (Joe Sixpack)"
Corel used to be a reliable software company producing great software. I think it has matured and is perhaps on the decline because it seems more and more that new innovation is lacking and quality control is not sufficient. You can read the rest of the reviews and see a similar story. Not what it used to be.... I won't be using this software.
"If you are used to Photoshop, don't go down to this.  If you are used to Digital Darkroom, don't go down to photoshop.  However, if you are new to photography, you can use this software as a good starter.  For those people who don't have the technical skills, the time, or the paitence (I fall into this last category) to use Photoshop or Digital Darkroom, this program gives you an affordable way to do 80% of what the pros do (and 200% of what you'll probably want to do) in one easy to learn package.  I didn't RTFM, I didn't look at the help menu, I just opened the software up and started using it, and you can too!"
These are adorable and perfect gifts for my grandkids.
Great deal
"Over several years, I have successfully and, for the most part, found this program easy to use and quick for the online filing of federal taxes.  This year, after having completed and submitted my 1040, I discovered I had left out some investment gains and needed to submit a correction and decided to use H&R's included 1040X procedure to submit this correction. This turned into a bit of a blessing.

In entering the additional investment gains I had left out, I discovered that H&R had incorrectly calculated my investments gains by including gain information from a previous tax year. In addition, the programs instructions for filing a corrected1040X, are fuzzy at some points which led me into obviously erroneous tax refund issues. Email and phone contacts were courteous but not helpful.

 As it turned out, when I agreed to allow the H&R to import my 2013 investment data into the program, the program failed to delete some of my 2012 investment data from the prior years tax return. Nothing like paying taxes twice on the same earnings!

The imperative here: the H&R investment data importing feature for 2014 really needs your careful attention if you have or should you choose to use it."
"As a hobby, my buddies and I started a youtube channel devoted to gaming and each of us (crew of five) have editing software of some kind.  I use Final Cut Pro X (FCPX) on my MacBook Pro as does our executive producer while the other three use Windows and, unfortunately with the updates from 7-X making it incompatible with Windows, they have to use other software for editing.  We were thinking of acquiring a few licenses for Adobe Premier as some of us had used it before, but were very fortunate to be able to try Corel VideoStudio Pro X7 and Ultimate Edition (see ultimate edition for related review).

Our co-producer and primary screenwriter tested Corel Pro and, after a month of use he has produced several video prototypes that look almost as good as FCPX albeit with some missing features that are in the Ultimate Edition.

Our screenwriter (Barnard) noted that the editing interface was incredibly comprehensive with your standard storyboard tools and clip editor very similar to FCPX.  He loves the selection of transitions, text editor, features generator (blank screens, shapes, etc.), and much more but laments that it lacks the smooth streamlined feeling of Final Cut.  Perhaps it was his older computer (Windows Vista, yick!) but he did notice a few moments of technical delays and lacking smoothness of operation.  Oh well.

All in all, Corel Pro is good for any amateur filmmaker or personal creating fun family videos that doesn't want to shell out well over $1000 in Mac products for industrial quality."
"The reason why we have to file taxes is because of Intuit. They make bank off having people pay for state tax e-filing - even with the title of the software being as it is, it does not include state e-filing. It can do them, and you can print them out, and mail them in, but it's $20 to file state taxes electronically and this goes to Intuit, not the state or federal government.

Changing jobs, dumping my 401K after having taken off and not paid back entirely a couple 401K loans, I wanted to make it more painless. It did do that. I'll get this next year as well, but only to compare to what I've done every year - filed them myself...and see if the numbers are different...and WHY."
"Creating, editing, and sharing videos is easy with<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VideoStudio-Pro-X6/dp/B00BFNCFZ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VideoStudio Pro X6</a>.

Every camera I own that records video does it in a different format, and Pro 6 recognizes every single format.  This is just one aspect of its true versatility.  It doesn't matter if I want to edit video from a webcam, DLSR or digital camera, or a videocamera.  As long as the files are on my computer, and I can find them (heh heh), it can edit them.

The project manager has a browse button.  Just choose the files you want to edit and off you go.  Improve the video and sound quality with the installed correction tools, add titles and transitions easily.  They're in the software package, or you can make your own.  I've done it.  It works!  You can use what's in the package, or add your unique titles and transitions.  You can also add voice-overs and music tracks.

You can save your videos to disk, or share them on youtube.  There's a button for that.

All of this works fast, and if you don't like what you did, you can change it.  As a hobbyist, I spend more time doing this than anything else.

The one thing I wish Corel would do is offer a buying option that allows you to purchase a hard copy of the user manual for a nominal fee.  I know, a lot of people aren't going to read a manual, but when I'm on the computer and need to look up how to do something, it's easier for me to have a book.  There is an online guide you can download, but I want the book.

Still, I'm happy with this software, which is compatible with Windows 8, by the way."
"I've used too many anti-virus and anti-spyware applications over the years. Bitdefender is another in a long line of programs that get the job done, but simply aren't worth the extra money after the end of 2009. First, let me make it clear that Bitdefender does everything they claim it will do. It does an excellent job identifying and isolating risks to your PC. In that sense, Bitdefender is great and worth buying.

Unfortunately for Bitdefender, Microsoft finally figured out that they need to do something about Windows security. Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) is now available for free download from the Microsoft website and is better than Bitdefender in a number of ways:

1) MSE is free.
2) MSE doesn't hog PC resources ... so your computer doesn't slow down because of the anti-virus software.
3) MSE is easier to manage because it integrates well with Windows.

Bitdefender identified all of the test viruses and adware I intentionally tried to expose my PC to, but why pay money for software if there is something else that does essentially the same thing for free? One advantage that Bitdefender has over MSE is that Bitdefender runs a full system scan faster than MSE, but Bitdefender also consumes more system resources ... so your computer slows down when Bitdefender is running a full scan.

Bottom line, there's nothing wrong with this software but I just can't recommend it now that Microsoft Security Essentials is available."
"I am a 15-year Photoshop user, I love it and consider it second to none, and I will continue to use it as my primary photo editing software.

Having said that, I also have to admit that this is an incredibly rich program for the price. I was in a rush trying to get one of a limited number available during a cyber Monday promotion and I clicked to purchase before they were all gone. I thought I was getting Painter (which I've wanted to try for a while). I almost was going to return it when I started carefully reading what the program contains and what it can do. Curiosity got the best of me, and I'm glad.

While I don't find the interface especially intuitive--even if I wasn't used to a different workspace--I think that it can't be that difficult to learn. I'm impressed that it handles RAW files, that it had an HDR module, that it not only performs the basic image editing and color correction functions but it also does photo blending, skin smoothing, and noise removal, that it has text functions, works with layers and 16-bit images--really does a lot for the money!

Is it capable of doing everything at a top professional level? I don't think so. But it has enough power so that the average person's normal photograph with typical problems will very well processed with minimal effort.

Since I'm not familiar with Photoshop Elements, I'm not sure how these two programs would compare in either functionality, interface, or quality of output. I don't think that it can be said to compete with full Photoshop--but then it costs less than 1/10th what Photoshop costs! I'm also a bit of a control freak and I didn't find the level of control and fine tuning I'm used to. But I'm impressed with the number of functions and features that Corel has packed into this program.

Additionally, I've always wanted to get Nik Color Effects Pro plugin, and it comes included with this program. That, alone, is worth the purchase price. I can bring in any file saved in Photoshop and try any of the Nik effects or other effects that might be similar but different from what I have in my ""serious"" program. Then it has some fun frame process that creates a clip-art like embellishment for photos, cards, scrapbooking, or invitations (for some reason, they are called Picture Tubes). Not high art, but fun things you don't find in Photoshop. For the hobbyist, this is the better program.

All in all, it's a LOT of program for comparatively little money."
"I can remember watching my grandma iron clothes. She used a lavender scented spray, and sometimes starch. The clothes also usually smelled of the fresh outside as we hung our clothes on a line. She would let me spray and iron the hankies and pillow cases. To this day the scent of lavender brings back such happy memories.

The Pre De Provence lavender spray smells fabulous. Not the least bit musty, which some lavender sprays can get a bit of a musty undertone, not this one. It's fresh and clean and brightens the entire room. I iron clothes inside out if I'm going to use any spray, and a light spritz left a wonderful fragrance, not overwhelming, and didn't stain my clothes. I would suggest trying a small out of the way place first.

The spray is also good for just refreshing laundry. Getting out winter clothes from storage that are perfectly clean but could just a use a little pick me up after storage.

also very nice spritzed lightly on the bed a half hour or so before going to bed leaves a clean, lavender sleep experience.

Truly something I'll be buying once this bottle is gone, although given how little it takes the bottle will last a while."
My daughter just got her driver's license and I have been using this to make sure she is using the car responsibly when she by herself. It allows me to see if she goes anywhere she does not tell me about. It also allows me to monitor her speed and braking habits. It gives me peace of mind that she has reached her destination when she forgets to let me know. It also allowed me to help correct a bad habit she was acquiring of idling for long periods. I think it is an amazing tool for parents of new drivers!
"AutoCAD LT is the younger brother to AutoCAD the full blown version that utilizes AutoCAD LT features but with 3D. A lot of design engineers use Google Sketchup as a quick and easy way to render new designs in 3D and then create their finished products in AutoCAD. That is one disadvantage to the LT version it is only 2D. I wrote an extensive review on AutoCAD LT 2011. 2012 has seen a lot of improvements in ribbon speed, startup times, and the new auto-complete command entry feature saves more time because all you need are the first few letters of a command name and a list appears. Content Explorer is also new enabling you to search for local content locally or on your network.
One big advantage to AutoCAD LT is that you are working in true DWG file format enabling you to co-creaate with others. With the AutoCAD WS web and mobile application you can edit online, being able to share and connect from a web browser or your mobile device."
Great Magazine
"This magazine started out really good. I don't know what happened or exactly when. I had gotten this for my wife on several occasions via subscription. The last time my wife said not to renew, and made a comment about some of the subject matter just not pertaining to real people, and the products raved about were mega hundred dollar shoes and such."
"I have been using Quicken for years, and saving time downloading bank, credit card, investment, and  other financial data. Quicken worked well with all my accounts from the mid-1990's until a couple years ago, when Bank of America downloads no longer worked. Everything else still works fine, but there seems to be an impasse between the Quicken and Bank of America technicians and I suspect it's the security folks on both sides. For Quicken's inability to work with BAC, I give the program a 4 instead of a 5. I have found that, because of the way I budget each year (duplicating the past year's data for all accounts), that I can reconcile my BAC accounts just about as easily by simply comparing my Quicken and BAC account screens. I am ticked at BAC for its side of this impasse, especially since they stonewall me when I ask ""why are you making this my problem?"" Unfortunately, bank accounts are ""sticky"" and I would have to reprogram many direct deposit streams and bill payment streams to change banks. And there is nobody producing a replacement program for Quicken which has the same functionality or track record, so I suffer on with it."
"Well, what can you say: they're the only game in town."
"As a hobby on the weekends I run an AV team (five crew members) of gaming junkies that help run a youtube channel devoted to gaming and not all of us have enough discretionary income to purchase MacBooks and/or Final Cut Pro X.  As such it was a real treat to test out both Corel VideoStudio Ultimate and Pro X7 (for more information on Pro, see respective product for more) and we've had very positive feedback on the Ultimate edition.

Our co-founder and marketing expert Tom tried the Ultimate version and quickly discovered that his laptop was not only grossly obsolete (Windows 7) but most of the features exclusive to the ultimate edition are more gimmicky than utilitarian.

After find Tom a suitable computer to work on, he began working on a Legend of Zelda project using in game footage we captured with an Elgato capture card and some live-action sequences we filmed.  One of the first things he began to experiment with was the 3D plug-in and quickly disregarded when his new PC didn't feel like supporting them that and we have no need for them.  The other premium plug-ins were the Hollywood-esque transitions and titles but they still resembled something a high school or film student makes in his bedroom so they're not that great.

However, what Ultimate missed in its plug-ins it makes up for in its comprehensive layout and use.  While not as streamlined as Final Cut Pro X, it still had a very easy-to-understand layout even for rookies like Tom to understand and master quickly.  The software is, relatively, user-friendly and that is a plus to anyone that doesn't feel like shelling out over $1000 in premium software or Mac products like I did.

All in all, I would probably recommend Pro over Ultimate since the premium features on the latter are less professional than one would think.  I'd keep things simple."
What can someone say about a gift card... Can use anytime...

"Just bought a Security WebCam about two weeks ago,  before I got it up and running, I read several reviews about this program saying it was better than the software that came with the Camera...  Low and Behold a few days after reading them reviews and deciding I would like to give this program a try,  Amazon offers it for the GREAT PRICE OF $00000000"
just installed it and it works a lot better than my old 2003 version but it going to take sometime to learn to use it...
It can hang from the tree!
"<div id=""video-block-R32K8LO2C2CRSU"" class=""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block""></div><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81RBr5E33TS.mp4"" class=""video-url""><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Ih%2Bk1WiNS.png"" class=""video-slate-img-url"">I'm incredibly impressed with the accuracy and speed of Dragon Dictate 3, after testing on a 2009 Macbook Pro with dual cores  and 8 GB RAM and a 2008 Mac Pro with 8 cores and 12 GB RAM, both running 10.7.5 Lion.  As far as I could tell, at most one core is used by Dragon Dictate, though.

The attached video shows the speed of recognition after voice training by reading the phrases in just the first and simplest voice training scheme.  I read some paragraphs from an advanced equine anatomy text and everything was typed perfectly.  I was truly amazed, not just in comparison with Apple and Google internet-based recognition (which do not involve training) - but in comparison to the last time I evaluated speech recognition using a trained product, several years ago.

The pluses for me include:

1.  A profile is created for each user-microphone combination.  This profile can then be voice-trained by reading scripts to improve accuracy.  Five script scenarios are included, and all five can be done if one wants to really tune things.  I found amazing results after doing just one script.

2.  Individual words can be added and trained, so that names and technical terms will be recognized accurately.  This is easily done via the Vocabulary Editor.

3.  I can speak really quickly and the result is still accurate

4.  Dictation can be into pretty much any application.

5.  Voice commands can be used to control apps, but I have little personal interest in that.  It would be extremely helpful for someone with limited eyesight, coordination, or other physical limitations.

6.  A variety of microphones, including smartphones, can be used for dictation.  Sound files from phones and voice recorders can be transcribed.  A corded USB microphone is included in the box.

7. Efficient voice selection and correction of text

The negatives for me include:

a.  Transcription of a sound file (from a voice recording) can only proceed if a profile (trained voice/microphone pair) is loaded.  Dictate will ONLY load a profile if the corresponding microphone is connected.  Tech support says this is as-designed.  But, it is incredibly stupid when the microphone is neither needed nor used during a transcription process.  The effect is that if you have a sound file containing someone else's voice, and they've trained a profile with a microphone that you do not have, you cannot transcribe the file.

b.  Special vocabulary is saved per-profile, so you have to re-enter all special words (and then re-train) for each microphone that you might use.

c.  The user interface seems really illogical.  I've attached an image to the product at the top of the page showing that there is a red 'Stop' octagon when the microphone is off.  Clicking it does not stop dictation ... it STARTS it.... turning the symbol to a green circle.  The green then means 'go' ... speak and Dragon Dictate will transcribe or respond to commands.  Clicking the green circle restores the red stop sign.  This seems backwards to me, but that's just me:  I would think that clicking the stop icon would STOP recording and clicking the green circle would START it.  If thinking of status lights, most recorders have a red light when they are recording / broadcasting and no light when inactive.  I can't get my head around what Nuance was thinking here.

d.  A variety of actions in the tutorial would not function, particularly spelling mode.

e.  It is challenging to type words that are also Dragon commands.  For example, whether I pause before and after ""new line"" or say it all together within a sentence, the words are never types ... instead a line break is always created.  I can fake it by pausing on either side of ""new"" and then either side of ""line"", but the instructions say that this is unnecessary.  Dracton Dictate has so many built-in commands, that you never know which ones will be obeyed versus typed, so you need to watch your output as you speak until getting used to it.  Personally, I'd like the ability to create a profile in which I disable all commands I never intend to use.

Bottom line:

Useful?  Depends on your typing skills vs verbal skills.  I can type extremely quickly and (usually) accurately and compose best while typing.  Others I know, while reasonable typists, think better when voicing their thoughts aloud, and one friend is particularly interested in Dragon Dictate to get some rough drafts onto paper because of her vocal process.  For those who are slow or poor typists, or who have some physical limitation, I think Dragon Dictate is an excellent value.  For those on Mountain Lion, which includes free internet-based dictation from Apple, the choice will be more personal.  The Apple dictation requires a live internet connection and is not voice-trained, and hence is less accurate; it also does not support voice correction or voice command.  There are audiences for the free Mountain Lion feature as well as for the more powerful Dragon product - I'd suggest first trying the free Mountain Lion feature and if it satisfies your needs, great; if not, take a look at Dragon Dictate 3.

UPDATE 11/30/12:  I would take a star off this review based on the absolutely horrible Nuance customer support.  I've never encountered a more useless system - slow web response,  keeps invalidating my support account, preventing access followed by inability to re-activate the account with the logged cases...and staff which give stock responses that do not address the question asked.  Terrible customer experience leaving me feeling pretty negative about Nuance as a company.

Latest tech support response (unbelievable to me):  Asking them why the built-in microphone on Apple's LED Cinema Displays is not recognized by Dragon Dictate, this is the response:  ""Dragon Dictate requires a mic that has a type that is USB. Go to System Preferences > sound > input. What is the ""Apple LED Cinema Display"" connection ""type?"". If it is not USB, What type is it?""  In other words:  they did not even test Apple's hardware for a Mac product."
"I have been using Norton Internet Security (NIS) for years and have never had a problem. A few years ago, they were criticized for taking too many resources, but this problem was fixed at least two years ago. Since this is a subscription software and really does not need to be reinstalled every year, I just buy the online download version and record the new product key assigned to my purchase. This way, I can renew my subscription in minutes rather than wait for a shipment. Note that I said the software does not need to be reinstalled, but it can be upgraded to the latest NIS version from one year to the next. To do this, open NIS, and then click on Support, then Check for New Version. A web page will open saying there is a new version available with instructions on how to upgrade, or it will say that the current installation is already the latest version."
"Paint Shop Pro X7 Ultimate is a great program that offers a lot of features. Comparable to Photoshop Full, it offers a wide range of creating, editing, adjusting, and manipulation tools.  Even though I prefer Photoshop a slight bit more, especially since I've been using that for the past seven years, this program offers a similar experience to Photoshop. If you have experience working with past version of either, you know what you are getting. If you are new to photo creating/editing/manipulating, both program require you to learn how to use the features. PSPro has video and written tutorials available on its website (link through PSPro), that explain the features. It takes practice to get good at these programs.

The Magic Fill tool works great in the tutorial, but worked okay for most of my photos. I had to apply it multiple times to get the photo I wanted. It is a feature that does complex work, so don't expect it to work wonders or work perfectly every time. Sometimes manually doing the work instead of using the Magic Fill tool will provide better results. But definitely try the Magic Fill tool first.

I worked with the new RAW editor and it's good. It's not as good as the Photoshop RAW Editor due to less precision in its adjustments, but it did help edit RAW images nicely. It works quickly and smoothly, although one or two features did require a few seconds to think before applying.

The Face Tagging program does a great job most of the time, and an average job some of the time of finding faces in photos. It will search through the photos you specify in folders and bring up the faces. Then you create a new name or specify the name to associate with that face. You have to do this with every photo.  But the process quick. Then you can just click on a name in the work area and it will bring up every photo associated with that name. A great way to find photos.  The feature works very smoothly (using my PC specs) and quickly. I am using a Intel Core i5 3.1Ghz PC with 12 GB of RAM. I am running 64-bit Win 8.1 Pro.

You get two discs: Paint Shop Pro X7 Ultimate on the first disc, and FaceFilter Studio 3 on the second disc. PSPX7U requires 337 MB of space for the install.  Install takes about 7 minutes. I'm using a Core i7 with 12 GB of RAM. The program runs very smoothly while editing photos. After registering, you get access to free video tutorials, free written tutorials, tips, and their
knowledgebase.

I've been using Photoshop Elements for the last 7 years. For one year, I used the full version of Photoshop. I enjoy photo editing and manipulation, but I haven't had the need to use the full version of Photoshop every year. Paint Shop Pro is a great alternative to Photoshop. It is very similar in functionality. PSPro offers a wide range of brushes and tools, but at a lower cost than Photoshop Full. Working with layers, photo editing, removing objects, using filters. All those are the same as Photoshop. PSPro runs mostly smooth on my Intel Core i5 3.1Ghz PC with 12 GB of RAM. I am running 64-bit Win 8.1 Pro.

TUTORIALS: There are video tutorials and written tutorials available on the Corel website, and the link to them is also available in the PSPro program. They are useful tutorials. Some of the features are not intuitive. There are some details provided for each feature at the bottom when you click on it, but trying to find certain things and how to use them properly takes some getting used to. I definitely had to research how to do a few things I do so easily in Photoshop. Good thing for the tutorials though.

The 64-bit and 32-bit versions are included.  After importing photos, you can add star ratings and tags to photos. You can't do this during the import. You can save photos in about 35 different file types, including PSD Photoshop format. You can customize the workarea by closing out windows and panels you don't need. When working on photos, you will see the changes occur directly on the image you are editing/adjusting. Some of the options do need a few seconds to apply your changes. Most simple changes of features occur instantly. You may be expecting instant changes, but some of the advanced features do require time to calculate and implement.

Paint Shop Pro X7 Ultimate runs smoothly, but I find that Photoshop Elements runs a bit smoother for me by about 10%, and Photoshop Full ran even faster by another 10%.  It's not a huge speed difference, but it is noticeable a few times. If you are serious about learning how to create, edit, or manipulate photos, this program will help you do some amazing things. But you will need to spend the time learning the features. Learning this program is just as time consuming as learning Photoshop would be. But it will let you do some amazing things that will let you impress others with your photo skills."
"Like many other people I am using the Dragon NaturallySpeaking Home version 11 to write this review.

Therefore, any mistakes in spelling or punctuation are from this system.

The software was easy to install. The only problem was with the headset one of the main earphones fell off and it took a lot to put it back where it belonged and have it stay there.

I would recommend this for people who do a lot of dictation as it would save a lot of time the one issue would be with titles as it's hard for it to know when to capitalize.

The one good thing about this is it does not pick up ambient noise is therefore if you have the stereo on RT on it will not pick up these noises.

I'm still exploring all the possibilities of this product as a claims it can do more than just dictation. Once I have tried more I will read review this product but overall it's because good job for what it is supposed to."
"Easy to load, lots of updates but that is to be expected."
"Bitdefender works really well on both vista and xp machines, and I really like the clean interface and the fact that it runs pretty low key in the background without excessive popups requiring user responses and it doesn't drag down system resources.  It installs flawlessly, and even will uninstall other antivirus software in case you forgot to do this yourself, which I thought was a really nice touch.  My main criteria for security software is that it needs to run quietly in the background and not hog resources or cause other system issues - which McAfee Antivirus and Norton Internet Security can't seem to figure out how to do.  Before this I used to use Trend Micro PC-Cillen exclusively because it used very little system resource compared to the others, until their latest version which suddenly ballooned into huge resource hog - I don't know if they've fixed that yet or not, I haven't gone back to it since.
  Bitdefender seems to have none of the problems that plague other security software, and I would switch to it exclusively, except on my main PC's I am sticking with Windows Live Onecare, which does the best job of integrating seemlessly into the OS (naturally, since it is Microsoft).
  As far as which is better at stopping viruses and malware, I can't really say, since I am a low risk user and rarely am threatened with viruses and have never accidentally downloaded malware.  I suspect Bitdefender would out perform Windows Live Onecare on this score, which is why I would definitely recommend it to any who doesn't practice safe surfing.
  All in all, it's a very comprehensive security package at a great price and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to friends and family."
Every year the installation of this software turns into a major hassle.  The software doesn't properly uninstall  the prior version and I have a mess on my hands.  Every year.  When is Symantec going to wake up?  When am I going to wise up and buy some other company's product.  This is ridiculous really.
"I began my college career as in illustration major. I was able to enter a fairly prestigious program as a result of my portfolio (and truly talented high school teachers who invested a great deal in their students). I left the program after two years ... I couldn't conform to the idea of turning-in sloppy-but-on-time work, especially as a photo-realist. Now, I am a professor of English (film-studies is my specialty). Still, I have never stopped drawing and I have always remained in the visual arts. Recently, one of my film-studies students was telling me that actual drawing is archaic. She wasn't taught pen-and-ink, has never used a tortillon, and did not even know about light-tables. She explained that EVERYTHING now happens on her Mac. What a genuine shock. After significant consideration about how this impacts the art-world (and a bit of mourning for my now obsolete talents), I picked up this software.

I provided this introduction so that you know I am entirely new to this form of art ... but not (at all) to art itself. Therefore, basically, I am speaking to those slightly older folks (maybe somewhere in their thirties) who have yet to make this leap.

As a whole, Painter is surprisingly intuitive. Now, since I was provided a short amount of time to learn this program (before this review had to be posted), I remained in the areas in which I was trained. While there was a considerable learning-curve, I was able to produce a few nice pieces (after a several scrapped ones). As I continue to play and expand into areas outside my comfort-zone, I will update this review. Nonetheless, I can also say that it is exciting to experiment with the options provided ... to tinker with a drawing and then ""reset"" it when I don't like the effects, well that's pretty invaluable. (I do remember those days of recreating a piece because my ""bright idea"" of adding spot color or stippling instead of cross-hatching turned out to be sadly incorrect).

The investment here is steep. But, for many of you, it will be well worth it. My advice is to find someone in your field who already has this, take it for a test-drive, and then assess if it is better than what you are currently using. Moreover, if you are a parent considering this for your high-school student, this is a fantastic program ... in fact, it really doesn't get much better."
"No problems installing and running the software, and wow, did it remind me of Corel video editors when I saw the UI.  Corel now owns Roxio, by the way.

It looks easy, but it can't find video files that don't have Roxio extensions.  I already have loads of photos and videos on my computer, and it did not recognize any of my video files.  I found a way to pull them in so I could try editing them.  It works, but it isn't great.  It's functional, but it simply doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles.  Professionals will hate it.  Even hobbyists will squirm, if they have used other video editors.  It creates .dmess files (that's not true, but the file extension is similar), and I wonder if it's compatible with commonplace viewers?  Honestly, I haven't tried.  I'm not optimistic.

It does recognize commonplace photo extensions, and the photo editor is very easy to use.  But it's not much better than the Windows photo editor you probably already have installed.

It does run on Windows 8, so it is an option if you're running Windows 8 and you're seeking budget software.  But I don't recommend it."
Product is as advertised - easy to use and hopefully beneficial to my dental health.  Transaction with Amazon completed with no problems.
"This marks my first renewal of Trend Micro Internet Security Pro, and indeed the first time I've stayed with the same security suite after one year... ever.

It's tough sometimes to review a product like this, because if it works well... and Trend Micro Internet Security Pro does... there is little to notice; no worms, no identity theft, no problem.  Is Trend Micro 100% responsible for those results?  Probably not, as I would like that think that my common sense caution plays some role in my lack of drama.  But I'll give them credit for at least 75% of my success.

Even moderately cautious users will occasionally click on the wrong link, and it's comforting to see Trend Micro step between you and a suspicious web site from time to time.  Note to those that might see this little intervention on a regular basis, you just might want to rethink what you want out of the internet (genuine information and entertainment, or ????).

So, no virus infections within the past year.  No Trojan attacks, and everything appears to be safe and secure.  This is good!

Besides the basics, there are two features that I appreciate most, the System Tuner and the Trend Micro Vault.  My Vista-running PC has always been slow to boot and vulnerable to lags caused by resident software like security programs.  But what good does a security program do for you if it causes everything else to run more slowly? Internet Security Pro 3.0 doesn't create that problem.  And the System Tuner helps you tweak your resident software and file sizes to make that even less a problem.

I've had problems with other security programs in the past (Microsoft, Norton and McAfee), but this has been the most trouble-free package for me by far.  Installation was simple and quick, registration went off without a hitch and my system performance is clearly better.

And what about the System Vault?  Consider it your last-ditch defense.  If someone manages to walk off with your notebook, System Vault won't let them into the files that you least want shared.  'Nuff said.

With the start of my second year as a Trend Micro client, I am even happier with the product than I was a year ago."
"Like the recipes, articles, sounds like I am going to be very happy with this magazine!"
"I first got into the Nancy Drew series when I was 12 (almost four years ago) when I stumbled upon a demo online of this exact game; It was fate I tell you :D! While I might be the one of the rare guys that play Nancy Drew instead of something like Call of Duty, everyone should give these games a chances, especially this one.

Being a relatively old nancy drew game, some may consider it unfair to compare this game to newer ones. But, this game can go toe to toe with some newer nancy drew games and beat them. Here's why:

Story: 8/10. Definitely not the most interesting storyline of the series by a long shot, but the orca's situation of having people fight over what to do with it was surprisingly intriguing to follow. By the end, I was dying to know it's fate.

Graphics: 7.5/10. For a relatively early nancy drew game, the graphics are great for that time period. They obviously can't really hold a candle to the new games (Ransom of the Seven Ships is coastal too and is GORGEOUS). The game looks a bit grey and dull by the boat, but that's probably what HERInteractive was aiming for. Interiors like the diner and Whale World look great.

Characters: 8/10. The characters were pretty tame in this game, but were distinct in themselves. You have the normal number of suspects (3-5) that each have their own personalities without going over the top. None of them are afraid to voice their opinions on what should be done about the orca, which to me was nice to see.

Puzzles: 8.5/10. Some left me clueless, and I had to use walkthroughs from time to time, but they were puzzles that weren't too easy, and weren't too difficult either. Some games in the series have less puzzles and more chores and jobs. Fortunately, that's not this game.

Activities: 8.5/10. Whale World was a great part of the game, and actually educated me about the ocean, which I didn't even realize until after I was finished with the game. The diner was somewhat charming, and the orca at the end was adorable.

Ending: 9/10. Some games end with a large chase with the culprit, but in this one it's a lot of sleuthing and catching the culprit is really satisfying. No more about it though, I'd hate to ruin it.

Total (averaged): 8.25 out of 10, rounded to....

8/10.

I highly recommend this game if you don't already have it, it's probably my second favorite one in the series (behind ""Secrets of the Old Clock."")."
what's to say
Son in law was very pleased. Thanks
"The federal program works easily and seemingly well. The state program for MS does not work so well. This year, our amended return put much of the information in the wrong spouse designation; I don't trust it. Last year, we got a penalty and interest from MS for our return completed with Turbo Tax.

This year, we completed our taxes and paid for e-filing for both federal and state. When we went to file the state return, we were told that it could not be filed electronically. we could not determine how to get our money back and had to contact our credit card company to file an appeal.

Help isn't always very helpful. The check your return part said we had 2 problems, then only identified 1."

"Why would someone pay retail when they were giving WIN 10 upgrades away free? Thats a tough question. For me it boiled down to the freedom of completely wiping everything clean and starting fresh (usually with a new hard drive and other components) about once every two years. I know there are other ways to do that but there are always remnants of those little nasties that seem to never go away even with a clean install. Starting with a new hard drive (actually SSD these days) greatly reduces the fear of data loss due to age and multiple rewrites and as cheap as they are a new drive every couple of years gets impressively new technology.

How does it all work out in real life? Well for just over a hundred for a full version licensed copy my experience is that not only do I get some customization options I didn't get in the free upgrade but Microsoft hints that I get pushed major upgrades sooner. That being said its a little disheartening that despite trying to buy the freshest retail version possible whats really in the box is the absolute first generation of WIN10 ... it still needs to undergo multiple version upgrades which have to be done in sequence, for example it simply is not possible to go directly from Ver 1523 to Ver 1706 without upgrading through each version in-between.

Im not sure what someone meant by calling the USB flimsy, its not. Its a half-full 16GB thumb drive of relatively decent construction. That being said, though, if you do a search for photos of the physical drive there must be a couple of dozen at least that all look different. The OS ships with a separate credit-card size user ID number that is convenient to store in a safe place.

Any downsides?  Well yes, Im finding them as I go along. One is some vague references in the fine print we all agree to by using this software to the effect that if you downloaded the freebie you are in a different status than if you get the boxed product in terms of transferability  including if you change certain key components inside your computer like the motherboard  and the possibility that the boxed version users may not get certain apps for free, or at all, that are included with the freebie version. Like I said, its all kind of vague and not easy to pin down.

I did notice some significant differences in compatibility with legacy software and some external devices when I upgraded this version to the Fall 2017 Creators Edition and when I did the same upgrade on another computer that has the OEM version of WIN10 installed.  Unfortunately, the boxed version seems to be less tolerant to being compatible with some older software and hardware.  But it is what it is, if you need a license key version you have to take what you're given."
"H&R Block helped me get my taxes done with no problems.  I submitted my return electronically and received a check in about two weeks.  This software takes you step by step on all the possible deductions, etc.  I have been using H&R Block for a couple years now and will continue to do so as it is not as expensive as Turbo Tax, but you still get your bang for your buck.  No problems or issues with this software."

"I looked forward to trying&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bitdefender-Internet-Security-2010/dp/B002I7PGT8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bitdefender Internet Security 2010</a>&nbsp;as it was a product that seemed to have a number of decent features. But let's get right to the point: there are better products on the market today worth considering. And with such products as the latest AVG Anti-Virus Free Edition, to name one, it's hard to recommend this one from Bitdefender, unless you're new to computing and just want an easy-to-install product.

I initially installed this product on two computers, an HP Presario notebook running Windows Vista, and on a Sony VAIO running Windows XP Professional. Both computers had all available software updates and Service Packs installed. There were no problems with the installation on either computer other than a number of mildly annoying little pop-ups and reboots, but if you've installed security and anti-virus applications before, then you are probably familiar with this happening.

Getting down to details...

Installation: For the most part, and other than the above noted minor annoyances, the setting up process was smooth, as should be expected with a contemporary package of this type.

Ease of Use: Bitdefender Internet Security 2010 was as good as any of the other ""major"" anti-virus and security packages on the market today. If you've been looking for an alternative to some of the other security products, then this operates as well as and in some cases even better than some of the higher prices packages.

Functionality/Protection: As one who has dealt with computer security and Internet protection for a number of years, this was the area that mean the most. In each case, the product handled any of the older viruses and isolated Trojan horses that I keep on CD for such testing. Also visited a number of older and newer familiar malware sites, and this Bitdefender application blocked each one.

Conclusion: Bitdefender offers a decent package for those who are looking for a reasonable computer security application at a fair price. The interface is good, as is the overall product, but there may be better choices worthy of consideration, such as the latest AVG Anti-Virus Free Edition (noted above), or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vipre-AntiVirus-AntiSpyware/dp/B0026PEP5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vipre AntiVirus + AntiSpyware</a>, which which this reviewer found to be a superior product overall, and one that I reviewed here some months ago.

In any case, Bitdefender Internet Security 2010 is a reasonably good product and deserves a 4-star rating form this reviewer, but it's just not a stellar product. It would pay to look at all of the recent security offerings, both free and paid for before you make your final choice."
"I actually got the key card from another online retailer because it was cheaper. I didn't have any issues loading it onto my computer, though it does take a while for the download from Microsoft. I hadn't even used the Trial version of Office for my new laptop, so maybe that is why it was easier? But once it was downloaded,everything was just as promised. It has the programs I wanted and will use."
"Used version 12 for a few months. Liked it so upgraded to version 14. Takes a lot off my mind trying to remember birthdays, appointments, yearly tasks, etc."
"I have used this product for years and have never had any difficulty, not one!  It's gone down in price over the years and the filing is free.  I use a number of other excellent Ituit items and this continues to be the go-to tax help."
I love these shoes! Great arch support and perfect for cardio.
I have bought a lot of these and they are always good.  Amazon has so much stuff that the recipient can buy almost anything with them.
"The Cyberlink PowerDVD program is notoriously buggy. See the photo? That's as far as I get when inserting a DVD or Blu-Ray disk. It freezes and stays like that until you remove it from memory, then does it again with a new disk. Buy Version 15 and they want you to upgrade to 16 (for $45). If you have 16, they want you to upgrade to 17 (another $46). They keep you throwing good money after bad that it really adds up. Mine has the latest patch and it didn't change a thing. It still crashes and is unstable. I couldn't get Cyberlink to help (they offer help subscription service for a hefty annual sum). Bottom line: They don't support their product. You can get the VLC Video Player off the Internet for FREE. Some of the software bundled with this player is loaded with adware. Very expensive and it doesn't do much except brighten the image and sharpen it a bit. I'd give it three and a half stars if it worked. But now I wouldn't give it a single star because it crashes and won't work."
The best Internet security around.  I love it.  No U.S. government back-doors here.

After reading all the horror stories from users using Quicken 2011, I really didn't know what to expect. I have to say though, for my usage, the transition from ""Money"" to Quicken has been painless. I have to admit though, my usage is very basic. I'm only using Quicken to keep track of several bank accounts, and update them online. When I installed Quicken, it downloaded several program updates. After it was installed, it converted all my ""Money"" files to Quicken format, and all my accounts showed up in Quicken correctly. I then set them up to connect to my banks, and it worked flawlessly. For my purposes, Quicken Starter Edition 2011 works for me. It seems very simplistic and basic compared to ""Money"" though. If I wasn't forced to switch to Quicken, I wouldn't have. But with no alternative, I'm just glad it went smoothly, and works."

"Got this one as a free read on the Fire and was very surprised to even see it listed, as I am a print subscriber and I didn't even know there was a Kindle edition. Still haven't been able to find out how/if print subscribers could get the Kindle edition included with their subscription. Mag looks nice on the Fire though."
"My husband and I used Microsoft Office for a lot of different projects.  We just purchased it and it has a lot of updated features, icons and more to offer.
I'm even in the process of practicing Power Point, one of my favorites.  Creating one to gather photos of my bird photography photos.  This gives me practice at seeing the updating it has and how it added more than the older Microsoft Office I was using.  It's great!"
"My wife has been struggling with the accounting for her business for a while; she understands the basic accounting concepts (she's taken classes) but hasn't been able to find a good program that does everything she needs it to do and is affordable. We were lucky enough to receive Sage 50 Premium Accounting 2014  (3-User) and she absolutely loves it! The interface is easy to use, the way everything is set up is pretty intuitive, and it more than meets her needs.

Her one objection to this software is the auto-renewal feature. It's always annoying when companies do this. In this particular case, you have to provide your credit card information in order to get the thing started. If you forget to cancel at the end of the year, you're in for a big surprise... and not a happy one."
"Wow -- this is full of bells and whistles!!! And while the HELP function is very good, it is 800+ pages worth of...""Help"", which can be a little confusing for this neophyte --- who is more used to Free-Download Adobe photo limited-function but easy to use editing software.

It was easy to install but I see that I have TWO versions of it showing on my screen and don't know if this is the norm - I have the Corel 32 bit and then the 64 bit (I have a 64 bit computer). Opening either one takes a looong time.

I have pre-ordered a tutorial book on Corel PaintShop Pro X7  , which I am sure will greatly assist my learning curve. What I do see of this while tooling around on the screen with it, is an extensive palette, and many options -- which surround the original photo to be edited on the screen. I know that once I get the hang of things, I will be like a kid in a candy shop.

Corel software has always had an in-your-face-here-I-am down to earth kind of presentation, so while it looks difficult, I can tell by the layout and the way the tools are paced, as we as the options presented on the screen, that this WILL be fun to work with once I get the hang of it."
"As with most PCs, the time it takes for my computer to boot up has increased dramatically since I bought it.  Of course, I have more stuff on my desktop and more things to load into memory when the PC boots up than on a new PC.  However, the software advertises that it ""accelerates slow system startups.""  If anything, my system starts more slowly after I used this software than before.  Waste of money.  Don't count on it speeding up your startups if that is all you are buying it for."
"Dell OEM Windows XP Professional RTM through SP1a is almost exactly like retail except for one small and one big difference. Windows XP of this type can install on multiple Dell PCs with minimal effort (provided you have stuff like drivers, and need a base service pack and not full updating. Full updating spoils the trick, because Microsoft grew wise to it. To explain this miracle to you, I have 4 Dell business PCs, a Dell OptiPlex GX400 from August 2001, running the RTM version (which does include the Microsoft Runtime for Java-Wikipedia is wrong on that) and it is only one of four PCs to run XP in this fashion. Windows XP Professional is installed using the same CD but updated to SP1a (but with the RTM having the Microsoft Runtime for Java, it's virtually SP1 original) on a Dell OptiPlex GX270, one of the ones that is supposed to have bad capacitors, but hasn't failed me yet, but then the fun continues. The GX270 has some updates for Firefox 3.6 to run on it, and it was no problem installing those updates.

Windows XP Professional is installed via the same CD onto a Dell Latitude D505 I bought to be my vintage laptop after the Clamshell iBook G3's hard disk died, and it is upgraded to SP2 flawlessly.

Windows XP Professional is lastly installed from this same CD onto a Dell OptiPlex 745 with a Pentium D CPU at 3.4GHz, and it is updated to base SP3 plus .NET Framework 2.0 on the 745, and they all installed and self-activated and as long as I don't do Windows Update on them, they all don't require their Windows XP CD-keys affixed to their cases (the GX400 had a $150 Microsoft OEM System Builder Windows XP Professional CD-key stuck on him as insurance should full updating be required in the future.

I am a computer nut, and I like tracing the history of a given OS back through the ages. Therefore, with my Dell OEM Windows XP Professional RTM CD, I can sit there and use the computer brand, models, and types out of that brand with those models I already desired to use.

Believe it or not, I am typing this review using one of the machines thus configured, specifically the GX270 Dell OptiPlex running Windows XP Professional Version 2002 Service Pack 1a.

Oh, and the browser I am using is Internet Explorer 6 SP1, so you know it's vintage.

This discovery is simply the most revolutionary thing to happen since XP was released. Oh, and by the way, here's the time for the little tidbit:

Dell OEM CDs of Windows XP Professional SP2 and later don't do this. They require a CD-key like any other version of XP. And if you get one of the XP Professional discs compatible with this money and effort saving trick, you can rest assured that like a Microsoft version of XP with only one minor exception-a Dell Solution Center button in the lower right corner of the Start menu above the Shut Down or Turn Off Computer button, again except for the fact that in order to get self-activation, you must be using Dell OEM hardware with a Dell BIOS (when the computer shows the progress bar, if it has a big Dell logo on it, you are good to go).

Again, with this CD trick, Microsoft can't fuss about what hardware you have changed or not, as long as the BIOS remains Dell branded-or if you update Windows, to where Windows is automatically updated.

This gives you leeway to run that cantakerous old peripheral (say a HP LaserJet 6P or a vintage weather monitoring system) that Windows Vista/7/8 just doesn't support.

Same way with software. If you want to run a vintage copy of Adobe Acrobat-say 7.0 or below, or a vintage copy of Adobe Photoshop (say 7.0 or below), you can, and buy a Vista/7/8 computer or a Mac for what they are good for, which is being modern Internet terminals.

So while this may not be retail, given the appropriate precautions, it's infinitely better than retail, unlimited installs given Dell hardware with Dell BIOS, and unlimited hardware changes (again, given Dell BIOS) and no bloatware. You are off and running with nothing more than the CD and burnt discs of the appropriate service pack or packs."
Does what a gift card should :)
Recommended for anti-virus and automatic back-up.  It works and buying the whole package from Amazon is cheaper than renewing through Symantec.  I didn't reload it.  Just used the code to renew for another year.  Will probably do the same next year.  Doesn't seem right that it's cheaper to buy the whole package from someone else than to renew but it is.  Go figure.
"Rock the runway is a bright red that reminds me of a fire engine red. It goes on like a cream polish, nothing iridescent or glittery. It's that classic red but slightly updated by being a little less muted. This one stands out.
And this is one of the absolute best top coats out there, at any price. The only way to get a better one, in my opinion, is if you use a UV gel, and who wants to spend nearly 20 minutes soaking in pure acetone in order to remove a UV gel?
I find that this polish and topcoat removes quickly with acetone, and less quickly with a non acetone polish remover.
The top coat also makes any little streaks or flaws in the polish disappear."
"I just finished playing ""Secret of the Old Clock"", and I loved it!  Before I say anything more, I think it important to add that I am 35 years old - so, take it from me, these games are great fun for ANYONE over the age of about 10!

This particular game is set in the 1930's (the depression era), and is about a young girl whose mother recently passed away - leaving her a bed & breakfast/bakery to run.  She did, however, write her friend before passing, asking her to come & help her 17 year old daughter if something should happen to her - and her friend rushed right over, trying to help out, but knowing nothing of the business.

Strange things started happening at the inn at about this time, and both the young girl & her guardian are convinced that she is having a nervous breakdown - that it's all in her head.  Especially since not only is she grieving the loss of her mother, but they are running out of money.  An elderly neighbor (who was quite rich) had promised to leave them plenty of money in his will - but when he died, it looked as though he left all of his money & estate to a man who supposedly taught mind reading & esp.

In comes Nancy Drew...  Is the will originally found the ONLY one?  Could it be a forgery?  And what of all the strange noises & happenings at the inn?  Who's behind them, or are they really all in the teenager's mind?  These are the questions you'll have to answer while playing ""teen detective"".

I found several differences between this game & the other Nancy Drew games I've played to date.  First, the graphics are better - in fact they are just as good as some of the more high-tech games I've played.  Second, you actually get to drive a car (but be sure to watch out for potholes)!  Last, there was much more ground to cover - which I really liked - so you get to see a lot of the town, and speak with several people (rather than just being confined to a house, and only talking to 1 or 2 others).  Oh, there's one more difference...  You actually have to earn money in this game - to pay for gas, car repairs, games & other necessary items.

Overall, I think this game is a ""must have"" for anyone who enjoys (or had enjoyed) the Nancy Drew series.  One of the great assets of these games is that they allow you to choose a difficulty level - but, I must warn all you other adults out there, if you haven't played many ND games (or even if you have!), you may want to choose the ""junior"" level.  This will allow you to get more hints if you need them - and if you don't, you just don't ask for them - as it's the number of hints that will change based on the level you choose to play at.

Another 2 thumbs up for the creators of Nancy Drew!!!"

"It is very age appropriate. If your child loves Sesame Street, they will love the game. My daughter who is age 7, still enjoys playing it from time to time. I love the fact that although kids love playing it and that they think of it as a game, it is very educational and helps them with Physical Science, Logic and reasoning, Problem Solving, and engineering. It is a very nice game and worth getting. I would highly recommend this."
"There are so many things not to like here. I will list but a few.  Deep integration with OneDrive. Good luck if you are a DropBox fan. You cannot even add it as an official ""Place."" That is a terrible decision. You can navigate there but you cannot have it easily accessed but the ever present OneDrive is always in your face. I also dislike the less colorful icons. And there are many things where you cannot change the default in any easy way. For example, there are complex registry editing work arounds to the aforementioned DropBox issue. You can also take a series of steps to create a half work-around for changing the default PowerPoint slide shape back to 4:3. But it's a pain. I do not know anyone using 16:9 slide shapes regularly. I got one recently from a colleague and I thought they had screwed up (because it made the fonts so small and hard to read). Of course, that all can be changed--but not with a simple default setting change. You have to make such changes for every single presentation you build. There are so many poor design changes where something that worked fine before has been changed in some more limiting or hard-to-find manner. I would try to stay with the 2010 and earlier versions of Office as long as you possibly can--unless you want to be very unproductive and Google a lot of stuff (that you'll find out you cannot easily fix) for awhile.

I will not let my company upgrade to this from earlier versions of Office. I cannot accept how many lost hours of productivity this will result in among my team."
"If you haven't read the New Yorker you should. Insightful reporting, riviting commentary, thoughtful fiction and a NY calendar that can't be beat."
"Used this last year, guess I never wrote a review. Does the job. Still hate that they charge $20 to submit state taxes."
"This is not a perfect magazine. For one, I was a charter subscriber when it first came out. I get the print and iPad edition. That has been awhile. While I have gotten older the magazine has stayed stuck at the same age. While I am now in an older demographic that its numbers are huge, it is pretty much ignored now.
Surely I am not the only fifty year old guy in good shape, or who is interested in being and staying that way. Maybe a mens health plus.
Anyway you get used to that sort of thing. One reviewer said all you need is one year of this magazine and it will cover everything. That could be true sort of, but I like it for the ideas, motivation, and it has some really cool food stuff, and recipes.
I get mens health, and I got womens health for the misses. The stories and info do not overlap. Most times I find womens health a better magazine. Womens health also suffers from the agest problem. They think their readers don't get older. If they follow their magazines fitness programs they should get older.. right?"
This program is powerful and easy to use. It is not simple like Koadk Easyshare or similar programs. For some reason I have a very hard tome using any of the Adobe Photoshop programs. There are times that one needs more powerful tools - the commands make sense to me.
"This is such a great tool for researching your roots and recording your family tree. These are two distinct tasks: researching and recording. Researching your background is where you find relatives you never knew you had. Recording is where you save the results of your research and report them to your future generations.

The 90-day free access to the Ancestry genealogy records is outstanding. After 90 days, there is a monthly fee and the fee is pretty significant. Check their website for pricing.

One misconception about the research service is that you can find your living and recent relatives. I don't know all the details, but there are privacy restrictions that prevent the web service from giving you info on living people.

All in all, the software tool and the online service are really incredible, but they're not cheap. I recommend you don't activate the 90 day service until you know your calendar is free enough that you'll be able to actually use it. Otherwise, you won't get the full benefit from the service before your 90 days elapse.

Researching your family's past really is an incredible journey. My mother traced one branch of our tree back to the Mayflower. Obviously this research wasn't simple. I can't even imagine how much easier it would have been for her with a product like this.

Have fun with your personal history!"

"I looked at purchasing this Router.  However, one has to wonder where these ratings are coming from since some of the reviews, along with the questions folks have asked about the product, do not seem to have anything to do with this product. What's-up Amazon."
"Easy to install, automatic updating and automatic scanning, checks everything but the family laundry. Super  Excellent Support.  If you have crashes of your PC, it is very easy to go to their web site and re-download your program and reinstall it, unassisted and no 64 digit codes to type and re-type and re-re-type.  My highest recommendations."
"First of all, I want to thank all the Microsoft employees who have left positive reviews on Amazon!

I have used the new office package for about a week and granted I am mostly doing word processing and that sort of thing. For me I don't really see a difference to 2007. For the money I paid I was expecting a little bit more. For the casual user the changes might not warrant the investment - or in other words - you ain't going to get what you pay for when you upgrade."
"The big sell for this version of WinZip is that it introduces a new, more effective compression engine.

That is nice, and it works completely as advertised, but I find myself wondering why they bother?  I can buy a 1 TB portable USB drive for about $100--space just isn't a concern.

The most valuable part of this product is the ""Plus"", which equates to their ""WinZip Courier"" add-on.  Once installed, this nice little add-on automatically zips up any attachment that you put on an email before sending it.  As email servers often still have low thresholds for the size of an email, so this is a truly valuable feature.

Three stars for being an average compression product, plus a bonus star for WinZIP Courier."
What can I say.  I've been using TurboTax for years and it has always proven itself to me.  It is very easy to use and it even does my state taxes too.

"I used this program on a computer that had MacAffee suite on it. It found and took care of some nasties that were lurking in the shadows. It was easy enough to download onto computer and use and hasn't been an issue since I put it on the computer.
I've found that MacAffee doesn't always do a good job. So, if you're looking for an adjunct program, or one to take the place of a program, you really should consider this one. Well worth the money."
I am not a vegetatian but I love the tips and the recipies this mag gives. And at a great price.
"I love OpenOffice and I hate spending money on buying MS Office.  However, I got tired of OpenOffice.  I got tired of it crashing when I opened files, the bizarre and irritating ""recovery"" mode, not being able to scroll in files, and so on.  OpenOffice has made great strides, but for non-trivial Word or PowerPoint inter-op or even just basic features with 3 on the Mac, it's just not there yet.

So I took the plunge and bought the real thing.

I haven't used the MS Office apps for some time, but lately I've needed to do some serious doc creation with them.  This is by far the best Office--I did consider buying 2007 to use on Vista, but the UI changes on the Windows version are too confusing.

I've had no inter-op problems with this version of Office and 2003 and 2007 on Windows, for both PowerPoint and Word.  Note that with the missing scripting in Excel, this Office version is not quite full-featured, and that costs it a star.  Furthermore, there's still stuff in Office that doesn't keep up with the simplicity of Pages and Keynote--Editing table cell borders is still a pain, aligning pictures in PowerPoint is tedious, and so on.

If you're fighting with OpenOffice and wondering why it's so slow and crash-prone, upgrade to the real thing.  If you're coming from previous versions, know that this is, by and large, pretty stable and fast.  I am puzzled why saving a 30 slide PowerPoint takes a good 30 seconds on my Mac Pro (it's so annoying I had to turn off auto-save), and Word and PowerPoint both do crash sometimes--but this is a great solution for those documents that need to be shared with others and thus Pages and Keynote do not get the job done."
"I am a PaintShop fan, for many years now. My needs are basic photo editing - cropping, lighting adjustments, redeye removal, and some added features such as borders and special effects. One of the things that Corel does so well is that it keeps these functions and their use about the same from version to version, so there is no steep learning curve when upgrading to a new release. This is a tried-and-true, reliable photo editing tool at a very good price. Not much more to ask for."
"I've found this to be good protection; I've had no issues with it.  Windows 8 can be a bit fussy with it at installation, though (but Windows 8 can be fussy with many things).

I don't prefer this to Norton, necessarily, but I don't dislike it.

Also, I think this is a good value for 5 users."
I like the free box it comes it.
You need to be very patient to use this buggy software. And to use the added features is going to cost you. It's like buying a nice inkjet printer and finding out that ink costs more than the printer. All that I swear I've had more Mormons visiting my house since I started using this. Seriously. I stopped using it and went to something more reliable.
Very cute case! Love
"In addition to writing many reviews on Amazon of entertainment products, I am also a CPA (and have reviewed some business books here). As such I have clients who come to me to prepare their taxes after they have used tax prep software, because the software asks questions in the interviews but sometimes overlooks their personal situation. Software is great for calculating and works well in simple situations. It's also (reasonably inexpensive).

Willmaking software and other legal software is similar. If you want to leave all your estate to one or two places, it's quick and simple. If you want to divide things based on certain ""Circumstances"" it isn't. BUT, if it gets you to at least make a will and - just as important - a Medical power of attorney, then it will serve its purpose. I've used both software (early versions of Will Maker when Nolo Press first started in the 1970s) and an attorney. Both had distinct advantages. I did find that if I spent the time with the software deciding what I thought I wanted in the Will and then gave the printed version to an attorney (knowledgeable in Estates) it cut down the attorney's fee as they didn't have to take the time to talk out my intentions. I had the best of both worlds.

This new version is user friendly and an improvement over past versions. And it is nice to have other legal forms included.

So, in my opinion, I would recommend it as a TOOL, but if you have even a moderately complicated estate, use it for the first pass and then consult an estate attorney.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

"I still don't know if it was a problem with my computer or with the Kapersky anti-virus program but I was unable to ever get it up and running. I contacted the company for support and that did not help either. Somehow it was incompatible with whatever I had on my computer even after I followed directions to remove my old virus protection. I did not have this same problem when I loaded McAfee on my computer, which runs like a charm."
Been using TT for years and it seems to get easier every year.
"I have been using DNS for almost 20 years, really! I depend on it to type for me.  The last two versions cause a hanging problem that Dragon has been incapable of fixing.  It is very frustrating. It works fine for a while then hangs/stalls.

The dufuses also put a part of the program in the temp directory.  I don't know if it happens on installation or training.  But if you ever clean your disks like you should of cookies, temps, etc, it looses something it needs. Who in their right mind stores important program files in a temp directory?!

It is also incompatible with certain Flash versions, and can screw up Firefox as well if you use one of those versions.  This is most likely Flash's fault.

I am computer proficient and have a powerful computer.  I reinstalled a few times,made a new user profile and tried solutions others suggested in their forums.

I can't believe they  have the nerve to try and charge such a high price for the upgrade to version 12.  People on their forums say version 12 has the same problem.  There is no excuse for such poor support for a program.

Do Not get it until you hear of a patch to fix the problems.

*******
OK it is time for an edit
Farthion's comments about posting system specs is well made.  I agree.  However antivirus programs should have no afftect on Dragon because Dragon does not mess with the Windows Kernel, Although you should briefly disable your antivirus program before installing most programs.

Major change: I need to revise my review.  3 stars now instead of 1.

I just rebuilt my system (I do it myself), and I must acknowledge that Dragon works very well on it.  In fact it can keep up with me if I talk as fast as I can talk!  Yeah, after training, it's that fast.  It still has some minor quirks, but they are not that much of a problem.

You need a better mic than the one supplied, but you do not need a new microphone.  I have a quality 12-year-old Parrot, and it is working fine.

My new system has an Intel  i7 3820 CPU, 16 GB of fast RAM, Asus Rampage 4 Formula motherboard, and I'm booting Windows 8 on an SSD drive, which is also where I installed Dragon.  It is a gaming rig and work rig.

I've been testing DNS for almost a month now, and I happily acknowledge that it works very well, even on Windows 8.  (You can install the free program Classic Start Shell to get past the hideous Windows 8 Metro screen and get back the Windows start button).

But there are still two problems.
In an effort to sell the product, Nuance drastically underestimates the system requirements.  Therefore they deserve the bad write-ups they get.  This program needs a powerful system, not as powerful as the one I built, but not as weak as the one Nuance would have you believe.

They require certain programs (ie Natspeak.exe and Flexnet) to access the internet every time the program runs.  It's a type of spyware.  Block them and the program screws up.  This is ridiculous.  Especially since their history for the past 10 years is to  only update once, about 6 months after the program comes out, with a service pack and never again."

"I put off trying this product for a long time since I already had Photoshop and Painter.  I didn't see the need to purchase another product when I already had the two most expensive drawing/painting programs available.  About six months ago I downloaded the trial version of Sketchbook Pro 2010 and fell in love with it! This new version adds some nice features (like layer blending modes) that enhance the software even more.

I still use Photoshop and Painter to complete my digital works--but I often start them in Sketchbook because I find it provides the closest sensation to drawing with traditional pencil and paper of any digital art program currently available.

The pencil feature creates lines that are almost identical to the lines you would get with a regular pencil.  If you have a pressure sensitive laptop or monitor (Wacom Cintiq) then the experience is almost identical to using a pencil on paper!  Download the free trial version and try it out first to see what I mean.

The interface is very basic and easy to use.  One great advantage of this program over Photoshop or Painter is that the majority of the screen is available for drawing--it is not cluttered up with menu bars and palettes!  I find this a huge plus when I am drawing on my pressure sensitive laptop that only has a 12 inch screen.  Space is less of an issue with my 22"" Cintiq.

I've seen some very impressive works that have been totally created in SketchBook but I still use Photoshop and Painter to finish my drawings/paintings  because these programs have advanced features that SketchBook Pro doesn't have (masks, adjustment layers, etc.).

Bottom line: When it comes to pure sketching--this software is my first choice! Combined with a pressure sensitive laptop or monitor--it doesn't get any more natural feeling than this!"
"Norton has almost always been my favorite security program. I began using it in 1990 when it was Norton Commander - a menu system for DOS -  and stuck with it through almost all its incarnations. At some point, maybe seven or eight years ago, it became bloated and I began using free products, which worked fine without slowing the computer to a crawl - but I missed the full scans and features in Norton that I always found so trustworthy.

Six years ago, I switched to a Mac and didn't go back to Norton. I used nothing for a while since Macs are less likely to be hacked, but that made me very nervous. I installed the free version of Avast and used it until a Mac-savvy friend who was trying to speed my old Mac back up told me I really needed Norton for Mac. (Indeed there was a disk-filling virus in that machine that only Norton was able to catch - Avast was unaware of it.) He told me to run full scans regularly - not just the quickies - and I did that, too.)

When I got a new Mac earlier this year, my Norton was expiring so I went back to Avast for a while. It's good - it caught a virus, in fact, and does a lot of what Norton does - but it slows the computer considerably.  Now I have Norton in my new Mac and things are running very smoothly. The days of bloat are gone. Norton runs fast and clean and even the in-depth scans don't take too long - or slow the machine perceptibly.

If you need to protect more than one device, get a version that covers multiple devices - it will be a lot cheaper. If, like me, you only protect one computer, this one is perfect."

"I will never upgrade my parents to this OS.  I can not imagine trying to help them use it over the phone.  It would go a little like this:

Mom: I want to have my email and my internet open at the same time so I can type a recipe in for your aunt.
Me: Ok. Are you using the mail application that came with Windows.
Mom: Yes, I click the mail button and it takes over my whole screen.  So does internet.
Me: No, you can't do that.  You need to open your mail in your browser, because I haven't figured out how to make the mail app not take over.
Mom: Ok, but I'm stuck again in the mail app.  It took over my whole screen. How do I get back to the internet?
Me: Well, you can put your mouse up in the upper right corner.
Mom: Why, nothing is there?
Me: I know, just put it up there and it will make the charms bar appear.

Me: Did you go all the way to the top right?
Mom: No... okay, I did it, but they went away.
Me: Okay, put it up there and leave it there and then go straight down the four little squares together.
Mom: Four little squares?
Me: Nevermind.  Just push the windows button on your keyboard.
Mom: Which button.
Me: It has the windows logo and might say ""start"".
Mom: Why isn't there just a start button on the screen like my old computer had.
Me: Hitting my head.
Mom: Okay, I found it.
Me: Did you press it?
Mome: Ok, I pressed it and now I'm back to all those square tiles. It is really cluttered like when you used to scold me for putting everything on my desktop.
Me: Yeah, that's it.  Click Internet Explorer.
Mom: Let me find it...
Mom: Okay it took over my screen.
Me: Okay, you need to open two tabs.  In one tab put in your email website and in the other put in the site for your recipe.
Mom: That's not what I want.  I want them side by side.
Me: Okay, you'll need to change to desktop mode and launch internet explorer in desktop mode.  Then you can have two internet windows open side by side.
Mom: Desktop mode?
Me: Yeah, press windows button and hold it down while you press M.
Mom: That just took me back to all those cluttered squares.
Me: Try again.
Mom: That worked! Where's internet explorer?
Me: Well, you still need to launch it.  You need to bring up the charms bar, search for it, and then launch it.  Then you need to configure it to run in desktop mode.
Mom: Nevermind.  I'll just call your aunt and read the recipe to her over the phone.
Me: Good idea.
Mom: Why did you put the new Windows on here?
Me: Because it is faster and Microsoft said it was simpler.
Mom: Umhmmm...

So, I gotta be honest.  I thought the concept was brilliant by Microsoft to come up with a fusion product that merges the world of touch traditional.  However, it is so poorly executed and provides such a jarring user experience at times that I just can't give it a high rating.  I'm afraid that I am just hoping for Microsoft to release some updates that allow you to force it into one mode or another. I'm forcing myself to keep Windows 8 to become proficient, and I'm resisting the urge to install one of the ""classic"" start button programs to make desktop mode feel like Windows 7, but it really is tempting.

I think Microsoft is onto something, but it just isn't right, yet."
"The app downloaded easy no problem getting it to work.
Spent very little time figuring out how to use it. Very easy to use."
"After tracking my personal income/expenses on spreadsheets, I decided to try Quicken.  Set up is easy, but Quicken really, really wants to interface with your bank accounts & makes it a little difficult to set up an account not using an interface.

My banks charge anywhere from $5 - $10/mo to download to Quicken, Quickbooks or Money.  The only answer I could get from my banks was that Intuit charges the banks for downloading (I do not whether this is true or not, but the banks would not budge on waiving the monthly fee unless I had an exorbitant amount of money in my account).  I can download to an excel type file from my bank, but can't figure out how to import that into Quicken.  I still have to play with this and report findings in the future.

I was able to set up my accounts & manually input my information.  Once this is done & assuming that I can keep up with the manual data input, the Quicken software should do a good job of helping me track my accounts.  It seems that it can be as basic or fancy as I want.

I will update once I have more data to manipulate in the software.  So far, so good.  However, I downgraded my star rating because of the charges for downloading my bank transactions and the fact that Quicken doesn't readily explain how to import an excel file into their software."
"I received a review copy of this software.  I was excited because my wife wanted to learn some Italian.  Unfortunately, this product isn't going to be the method that gets her there.

The software doesn't install on the computer.  With the cost of storage being so low these days, and with effective compression algorithims for audio (.mp3) and video (.mpg) that reduce file size, there's no reason to create a software product that runs from optical disc alone.  Even on a fast PC I built (AMD Phenom II 1100T 3.3 mhz hexacore processor with 8gb DDR3-1600 RAM, running Windows 7), the product takes a long time to switch between features, either because of the inherent slowness of optical disc access times or because you have to swap discs out to use different features.  Once upon a time, that was par for the course.  Now it's simply frustrating.

As others have commented, the interface leaves a lot to be desired.  These days it isn't hard to come across people with talent for graphical and website design, and there are dedicated software tools that make the process simple.  Unfortunately, none of those people or products appear to have been involved here.

This could be fun for younger users, but it doesn't have much staying power for the rest of us.  I haven't used Rosetta Stone, but I have to imagine it puts this product to shame.

In some instances, you get what you pay for."
"I love the fragrance and it leaves my hair very silky.  Combined with the Bvlgari Conditioner, this is my favorite brand."
"Well, knock me over.  Here's a men's bar that I really like for myself.  First the scent is wonderful.  Fresh without being overly perfumey.

To give you an idea of how scented it is, we received some of the Dove&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dove-Men-Care-Body-and-Face-Wash-Clean-Defense/dp/B009VGNYFM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dove Men Care Body and Face Wash--Clean Defense</a>&nbsp;and while I liked it on my man, there's no way I would personally use it.  The scent was just over-powering in the shower.

This bar though is mild in comparison and very pleasant.  About on par with the normal pink or green Dove bar soap that we sometimes purchase.  (I think the white has the least smell.  White Dove is our household standard.)

Second, I like how it didn't dry out my skin.  It's Winter and my skins a dry mess right now, but this bar doesn't appear to be making the situation worse.

So definitely would recommend."
"First of all this is not for a Mac. I did not realize it when I ordered it. I do have a PC with Windows 7 but it is not a laptop. It is a very expensive way to link your computer to your TV and be able to stream movies and download You tube videos to the TV. It is easy to install on your computer using the disc provided and the instructions are very straight forward and easy to follow. It is a very powerful movie and media player, but I think it is also very expensive. There is a mobile app that allows you to browse your movies, photos, music and videos using your smart phone. It can do a lot of wonderful things using your computer and TV, but be sure you have the correct specs to use it."
"Utter and complete A-holes!

Not only does the ""Premier"" software not include basic things such as rental property, but then when you try to finish your taxes, they double charge you for the state download.

Deceptive pricing, because this will cost you at least double the price stated by the time you download the rest of the program and you pay twice for the state.

And to make things worse, when you call in you get a robot which will talk you in circles for 20 minutes before sending you to a real representative.

I was told by the representative that they knew they had a lot of issues with pricing this year and will go back to the way they did things in 2013.

I don't know if I can believe them."
"This shower gel was decent. The scent was light and not overwhelming, and the gel lathered nicely and rinsed away without feeling sticky. My wife liked the product and commented that it wasn't runny like some of the other pricey gels she's purchased in the past."
"I am just done reading the May/June issue and I must say all the stories were wonderful. I have been reading this magazine for years now since my mother-in-law has a subscription and she gives me her magazines when she is done with them. I look forward to reading this each time it arrives. I think it is perhaps my favorite magazine of all time. The stories are just so good, comforting and inspirational. You never know when an angel is going to appear in the stories but something magical always happens. As someone who was once saved by an angel when I was almost drowning I can say angels are real and they do sometimes take human form.

~The Rebecca Review"
"I have been a TurboTax user for more than a dozen years and found this to be more than adequate for my use.  My wife and I are retired with normal income, IRA wihdrawals, rental income and depreciation.  Once the software updates were complete (a factor of waiting for Congress to detail the changes in laws which they passed for the preceding year), the sotware operated well and accurately.
This year, TurboTax (Intuit) divided the former Deluxe software into two parts: the one reviewed here plus an ""upgraded"" version to better handle depreciation and other rental expenses.  All of the forms are contained in this edition and can be completed by a knowledgable user.  It is my understanding that the upgrade (more $) has step-by-step instructions to lead one thru these operations, but I chose to do this function manually.
Taxes filed and accepted by both Federal & CA; awaiting refund."
"Same as usual, Turbotax"
"These gift cards are quick and easy and with so many items to choose from, even a picky shopper will find something they want.  Love em!"
"The good news about this suite is that it's very comprehensive, the bad news is that it's pretty slow and can be a pain to configure and install.

Everybody needs virus protection and a firewall., and Norton is a trusted name that's been around for a long time. I uninstalled some other virus protection software I had which had been very buggy. Norton gave me a full suite of tools for protection.

I don't use their backup software - option for other speedier software. I also don't use their identity management features. That makes for at least two features I have paid for but won't use.

I do like the fact that the license covers 3 computers - as many families have more than one.

I also like the feature that warns you when connecting to an unsecured wireless network. I think this will be the new wave of exploits that hackers use to steal ids. Log into a network on your laptop at a coffee shop or teh airport, and have a hacker record all your network traffic."
I'm a longtime satisfied Norton user.
"I have been using Kapersky Internet Security for a few years now, and have been very happy with it. I have had system crashes with protection being provided by both Macafee and Norton, but never with Kapersky. The only thing I had to do to update to 2011 was to input the liscense key and bad-a-boo! I was on to another year of protection. Kapersky remains my favorite Security Suite."
"Move over MS office, Iwork 08 is here.  Easy to use exactally what you need and no frills to cover up poor performance.  This is all you need!"
"Needs a lot of work to catch up to today's technology. Blocks a lot of what you'd like to work on, edit, or import. Reads errors where errors don't exist. Because of that I didn't fully trust it this year while doing my taxes. Have used Turbo Tax for 12 years now. If they don't get it together by next year, I'll probably move over to H&R or whatever else is out there."
Really nice app.
"TurboTax is a product I love to hate.  Of course Intuit is the monopoly and TurboTax is an Intuit product.  Why did all my other Mac Address book addresses blink in and out as I typed my registration name?  Even when I wasn't typing, the field kept on blinking.  It was as though Intuit was uploading all the names in the addressbook.  Then, when I looked for the use agreement, I couldn't find it to see if I had somehow agreed to give them my addressbook names???

Moving along, the TurboTax program's wording was better but still bad, leaving customers in the dark, even if we could read. The program crashed repeatedly while trying to copy my files to CD so it really can't do that.  Other than that, it was a little faster and easier, I suppose due to more interaction with the Feds and California.  Was my return right?  I doubt it. I think Intuit is still in a bit of a conspiracy to aid the governments in exchange for their networking.

The worse part was in the end when I saw the steep prices to file online.  There, true to Intuits form, I truly felt very RIPPED OFF!!!  I wondered if its lone large competitor, Taxcut, was the same way?"
"Why file compression?  The basic idea is to decrease the space needed to store data so that you can add more data to your backup device.  Also, file compression decreases the time required to transfer the data and allows you to email more data if your email service limits the size of attachments.

WinZip has been around since 1991, but it is not the only compression utility available.  Other popular compression utilities include 7-Zip, WinRAR and MagicRAR.  All of the  compression utilities can handle ZIP, the most commonly-used compression format, along with a number of other popular formats such as 7z, RAR, TAR, and GZIP.  WinZip does not compress into CAB, RAR, TAR, 7Z, or LHA/LZH.

Performance
The speed with which WinZip 18 compresses files depends on your processor.  Toms Hardware benchmarked several different compression programs using different processors and found that the choice of processor could half the time required for compression.  You can speed up the compression even further by choosing the OpenCL under preferences.  WinZip 18 claims to be the fastest version yet, but I haven't noticed great increases in speed as compared to WinZip 17 on my Core i7 machine.

File Formats
WinZip 18 can compress into six file formats including: Zip, BZ2, ZipX, PPMD, LZMA and WavPack. WinZip can not compress into CAB, RAR, TAR, 7Z, or LHA/LZH.  However, it can extract files from 13 formats including ZIP, CAB, RAR, GZ, ISO, TAR, TGZ, IMG, ZipX, BZ2, PPMD, 7Z and LZMA. This is very useful if you share compressed data with people who use other compression formats.

Zip to the Cloud
WinZip works not just with local files but also with data stored o the most popular cloud sites.  WinZip 18 supports Box, CloudMe, Dropbox, Google Drive, SkyDrive and the newly added SugarSync as well as ZipSend, WinZips sharing service.  WinZip 18 can retrieve files from the cloud or send data to the cloud in compressed form saving space and the time to log into your account.

Installation
I downloaded the latest version from the internet with the intention of then entering my license code from the product box I received.  During installation, I was asked if I wanted to add a toolbar to my browser and to improve WinZip by sending WinZip your usage data and the default option is to send the data.  I didn't want to do either and WinZip never bothered me about these things again.  So be careful when you install the product that you don't get third-party tools that you don't want or need.  Especially since I have gone back to find out more about the program to make WinZip better and I can find the settings turn this on or off.

Once WinZip was installed, I needed to enter my license code and then validate it online.  Here is where I had trouble because I kept getting errors.  I Googled the error and it turns out this is a common installation problem in Windows 7 64 bit.  It turns out that The Windows 8, Windows 7, and Windows Vista operating systems have security rules and User Account Control settings that restrict writing data to certain protected files and folders.  So, Windows was preventing the validation.  I tried following the workaround offered on the WinZip website which required me to delete a folder from my computer, but this turned out to be useless.  However, I could complete the installation by simply right clicking on the icon WinZip put on my desktop and running the program as an administrator.  Note that this method will not work if you don't have administrative rights on your computer.

Express Add Ons
One of the new features of WinZip 18 is the ability to add Express Add Ons.  These are programs for Windows Explorer, for Photos, for Outlook and for Sharepoint.  However, be aware that with the exception of the Add On for Windows Explorer, you have to pay an additional fee for the Add Ons.

The Add ON for Windows Explorer is free with the WinZip 18 license.  The Add On provides fast access to the key features in WinZip: compression, encryption, file conversion and watermarking, sharing via social media or email and uploading to a cloud service. All these options are present in a single window and achieving the task involves just a few clicks.  The benefit is that you don't have to launch the main WinZip program when using the Add On.

Summary
Overall, WinZip is a very good file compression utility with a lot of features that allow you to do more with the files you compress.  The ability to upload and to view files on the Cloud through the program are nice features.  I found the default options for adding AVG and performance enhancers to be annoying during installation, but since then there have been no other annoyances."
"I had to pay the higher rate to go fromTurboTax Deluxe to the Investments program  simply because the Deluxe no longer includes schedule info for Schedule D investments. Seems like a small difference,"
"I refused to use a walkthrough for this game. Absolutely refused. And players, I promise you don't need one. You just really have to put your noggins to work. Which I can understand why some people don't like that (who loves thinking? pah! -- I kid, I promise). I just really (REALLY) enjoy brain teasers and puzzles. I always have. My mother got me two huge books full of puzzles as a kid and I finished them within a month. That being said, if you like your games more straight forward, you probably won't enjoy this game as much. But that's ok too, there's a hints and tips forum on HerInteractive that you can check for assistance. And I promise, this game is worth completing.

My one complaint about it would be that I would have liked to have done more with two of the characters. One mostly just ignored you when you spoke to her (and I understand, she was very, very sick, but I wish we could have had more conversations with her) and the other only appeared a few times and you were never able to seek her out. I would have loved to have been able to speak to her.

But really, they're minor complaints. This game is rich in history, both fictional and some real, the spooky air is well maintained, and the mystery goes perfectly with the adventure. I felt a bit intrusive on the family, but that's a good thing. It makes Nancy as a character stronger. She is nosy to a fault. And I thank the creator for that because that creates amazing games.

If you're ready to take a challenge and be scared a bit, then you're ready for this game. But if you're looking for something a bit easier to complete, I suggest picking up Treasure in a Royal Tower instead. It isn't scary by any means, but other than that it has a lot of the same things this game does. Rich history and a lot of exploring. If you're looking for an easier scary game...well, they haven't actually produced an easy scary game yet (and I don't think Haunted Mansion/Ghost Dogs count as scary, Malloy is a meh game and I don't recommend it to anyone, and Shadow at Water's Edge, while being pretty scary, is also a bit on the hard side)."
"Really interferes with other programs.  I got rid of this one
as I could not stand it blocking other programs.  People
who make this program kept trying to get me to buy things
from them.  The setup process was really a scam.
DON'T BUY THIS PROGRAM."
"My grandkids loved their ""Easter Eggs.""  Beautiful card which fills the bill for a card and a gift.  They get so much candy that I always give them gifts.  This is the first of many years I will be giving them Amazon gift cards.  I'm sure next year's gift card holder will be just as nice."
"It is what it says it is, a gift card to Subway. No problems using the card. Giving it 5 stars seems kind of silly, but I don't know that it would be fair to give it anything less."
"This item saved my butt when i had to restore a computer.  I bought this item to restore my Toshiba laptop.  Thankfully I was able to accomplish this task.  I went all the way to Windows 8.1 and then proceeded to Windows 10.  If you want to save a bunch of money, this is the way to go."
"What can I say?  Turbotax is.... Turbotax.  If you're a small business, TurboTax Deluxe may well meet both your personal and business needs.  It has served me well for many, many years. The program is very thorough, accuracy of the program is guaranteed, audit protection is available, and electronic filing is free.  As long as Intuit doesn't try stiffing the user, I will keep using the Deluxe version.  I've got to give credit to Intuit for listening, when last year we made so much noise about their ""upgraded"" tax programs.  They refunded part of our purchase price on the more expensive versions they had forced us to buy when they moved forms to more expensive versions.  I commend them for rethinking that decision.  Had they not done that, last year would have been my last TurboTax year - and probably that of thousands of others."
"My second pair, love the fit, light weight and great support."
"The menus in these programs are completely unusable.  Microsoft won't admit they blew it, but instead want us all to believe the menus are ""more intuitive"".  BS.  I've been researching the issue, and evidently a company has software that makes the menus in Office 2007 look like Office 2003.  ThinK i may get it.  [...]"
"Rosetta Stone programs are very good for a quick and fast intro to a language, especially for the casual visitor.  I used a previous version to help me learn enough French to get by on my frequent visits to Paris (on business), and my son has been using this version to support his school French classes.  I found it very helpful in getting me quickly to a point of learning basic (broken) French, and improving my pronunciation and accent.  My son has had similar experience.

But be wary of the company's hype, that this is equivalent to an ""immersion"" program for learning a language, etc.  That's nonsense; in fact, I found it very lacking in helping understand French grammar, and completely inadequate sometimes in just helping understand French words.

So use it by all means.  But a good French-English dictionary is essential.  And so are friends/teachers who know the language and culture: I found it very necessary to ask questions of my French colleagues about proper idiomatic (and cultural) uses of various words and phrases."
"As a freelance photographer, I have used TurboTax Deluxe for over a decade for federal and California state income tax filing, including Sole Proprietor Sched. C and equipment depreciation schedules.  I just ordered it again because TurboTax now says if you used TT Deluxe last year you can use it again this year and they will FREE UPGRADE you to Premier or Home and Business, if necessary to do what you used Deluxe for in the past. I had already bit the bullet and purchased TT Home and Business, but didn't open the package or use it, so now I'm returning it to Amazon for a refund, less return shipping.  If I had opened the package and installed it, then Turbotax offers a $25 refund as long as you use the software to file by April 20, 2015.

Clearly, TurboTax got the message from negative reviews and complaints from the thousands of angry customers who bought TT Deluxe and discovered it no longer does everything it did in the past, or read all the product details and found they had to buy a more expensive version than Deluxe.  They are very apologetic and trying to repair the PR damage caused by the sudden product change. First came the emailed apology and offer of $25 refund if you bought a higher product. Then today Turbotax emailed the free upgrade offer if you buy Deluxe and need functions not included this year. The TT chief also promises that the features we are accustomed to will be restored to TTDeluxe for next year.

I've been happy with TurboTax Deluxe every year in the past, and expect to be happy with it this year. If not, you can be sure I'll post an update. I'm docking them 3 stars for the messy situation and giving 2 back for doing the right thing after all."
"Parallels installs quickly and easily.  For the XP installation, I followed the booklet step-by-step, since it's not as intuitive as the usual Mac install.  It is, however, easier than installing XP on a PC.

XP runs inside a separate window, which you can use full-screen if you prefer.  The 5 or 6 applications I need that are PC only have installed and worked without a hitch.  I was even able to set up a network print server (Buffalo Technologies) via WIndows, then got it to work on the Mac.  Tivo fans, it will run the Tivo Desktop, too.

Overall, I'm thrilled with this fast, smooth virtual machine."
"Get your geeky friend if you're a novice (like me).  Only my friends ended up being a limited amount of YouTube videos because I would have been unable to do some basic things otherwise.  Installation didn't take forever and the manual is like spanish if you don't know anything about photo editing software.  I made the mistake of thinking that my knowledge of Photoshop wold suffice but it doesn't.  However, if you have some level of understanding, I'm sure it's a great program."
Turbo Tax is the best tax program for me. We have a small business and it tracks everything great. Makes it quick and easy. It's A+ in my book.
"Got this for my 14 year old who loves making cool edits to pictures of his favorite athletes, then sharing with friends and posting online.  He was able to use a copy of Photoshop while he was taking a graphics course in school, but as that class is over, I thought this would be a good replacement.

So far, he's said it was easy to install, and found it fairly intuitive to figure out how to find what he wants to do.  He likes the bitmap to vector feature (TRACE) as he's able to copy images he finds places and add them to his finished product, often greatly increasing their size without any loss of quality.

He has just started using this product so not sure about the special effects he is used to v what is available but he seems to think from cursory review that it has a rich set of effects.

I like that it's a permanent license, something uncommon in software today. I also like the videos that help you get started.

Will udpate as the product is used more."
"I have a very small home jewelry and craft business and this software is probably overkill for me, but I have always had a hard time keeping track of inventory, payments, and keeping track of the stock that I need to male the items that I sell.

I have never used accounting software before, but my daughter is currently in college working on an accounting degree, so she came over and we installed the software and gave it a whirl. My daughter was pretty impressed with this software. I was more intimidated by it at first. But with y daughters help, I was able to figure it out pretty quickly.

It's pretty intuitive and easy to use and it will be a great help to me in the future. For now it will take me a while to get everything entered into the program, but once that's finished it should be smooth sailing after that.

So far it seems to be a nice piece of software that will do everything I need it to do and more."
"I used to love PC Cillin, until they became incompatable with Zone Alarm two years back, and I was forced to choose between Zone Alarm's firewall, and PC-Cillin's.  PC-Cillin had everything going for it, except its firewall... Zone Alarm won.  Now, two years later, they have 'fixed' the problem.  You must uninstall zone-alarm, install PC-Cillin, re-insatll Zone alarm... all this because PC-Cillins' firewall is HORRIBLE... it will let programs (i.e. trojans) on your pc access the internet.  Basically, you have no control over what programs get internet access and which ones do not.

So, with two years to fix their zone alarm bug, it seems that they've forgotten to do anything else.  PC-Cillin Internet Security Suite 2005 is little more than the 2003 version with a new name, and has a poorer antivirus program.

I've found that it is frequently 'unable' to delete viruses or even quaranteine them.  I must manually go to the folder where the virus may be located to delete them BOO...  I might go back to the Zone Alarm Security Suite which included antivirus.  So... If you don't mind manually deleting viruses (you need to be fairly experienced on your PC to open the temporary .ie5 files), then get this.  If not, and you'd rather your antivirus actually do its job, go with another product."
Still waiting for installation
"I tried installing this on three Macs (two iMacs and one MacBook), two regular installations and one clean install. Everything was smooth and perfect for each computer, and the installation process wasn't too long (30 minutes to 1 hr).

There aren't many major new features in this upgrade (which would explain the low price) but this upgrade is still worthwhile in my opinion due to the numerous minor improvements. Granted, there are a few major features (Exchange support if you use Exchange, OpenCL, 64 bit and Grand Central Dispatch for major speed improvements that will get more noticeable in the future, QuickTime X...) and the OS's footprint seems to have shrunk by about 10 GB, but that's besides the point. (If you're thinking about upgrading, by the way, I want to point out that this is just the first release, and you would be fine to wait a few months while certain apps are updated to support Snow Leopard and the OS itself is updated to alleviate the problems a few early upgraders have experienced. I didn't have any problems, but if you're cautious you can wait.)

I am, however, disappointed that the video cards on our Macs (which were bought before Apple started making the really good ones standard) aren't able to take advantage of OpenCL and some of the new high-def video improvements. This is the only thing I really wasn't happy about, but I'm getting enough other speed boosts and little features to still consider this a 5 star OS.

So what did I really like?
Spotlight is faster, and I like how it brings up emails and definitions in searches, too.
Time Machine is faster, shut down is faster, various things are faster.
If you've ever written a document that includes some right-to-left text (like Hebrew) in Leopard you may have noticed some major formatting problems. This has been fixed (as well as right-to-left text searches in Preview) in Snow Leopard.
When playing Chess, the computer understands my vocal commands much better. I'm not sure if there's an improvement in speech recognition for other programs though. It still isn't perfect.
When I copied in some old fonts into Font Book for the computer I did a clean install on, Font Book was able to automatically note and disable duplicate fonts.
Navigating folders in Stacks is now present, so it makes it much easier for me to find everything I want in the dock.
I can now play media content in their icons.
I can make movie and screencast recordings and trimmings with QuickTime.
Printer drivers work great out of the box without the need for me to install them manually.
File/drive size is now read in base-10 (rather than base-2 like it used to be and like Windows is) so now when you buy a hard drive that says ""500 GB"" the OS will say ""500 GB"" and not ""453.4 GB"" or whatever it would have otherwise said.
Safari is supposedly more crash-proof. It hasn't crashed for me in my light testing, but I'm happy because now I know to open Safari (rather than Firefox) if I want to do something like watch a flash-based movie without my browser crashing on me.
I also read that Apple has put some kind of anti-malware thing that checks if you downloaded an infected file. (Not like it needs it, there's almost no malware for OS X.) It currently isn't loaded up with many definitions, but I'm happy that in case someone DOES manage to make a raging Mac virus (which is getting more risky as more and more people use Macs), all Apple would have to do is do a minor update to that file and bring protection as peace of mind and an extra layer of security. And the anti-malware doesn't slow down the Macs at all (unlike certain 3rd party apps).

So all this shows me that Snow Leopard has been really well thought out, so it really makes it a joy to use. For the price, I really think it's worth it to upgrade even if you have Leopard, especially since it will mean that software developers will be making compatible programs/updates for your OS for a couple extra years."
Old version.  Not a terribly relevant product now with the popularity of smart phone and expanding internet cell coverage with free access to really good maps from other companies.
Love this place
"Having used this for several months now i found the immersion approach to be well suited
For french. It is familiar enough to really progess rapidly essentially through pattern recognition. Other more diverse
Languages are difficult to learn and some user may find the
Rosetta stone approach to be overwhelming in those instances."
"WordPerfect is great for those who don't want to take their hands away from the keyboard.  And the reveal codes function is great for finding those pesky codes that create havoc in formatting a document.  Great price for a complete productivity suite, and fast on older machines."
"Good information on hiking, clothes to wear, and survival skills. I really enjoy all the articles on the latest technology when it comes to camping and hiking."
These shoes are great.  This is the second pair that I have purchased and I love them.
Excellent articles but I haven't been able to use any of the recipes. If you order this magazine be sure you just want to read what others are cooking.
This has been my favorite forever!
"This was my first time using Quicken. I mainly use it to track spending in my checking account, as well as my retirement accounts. It does have the capability for tracking investments, mortgages, etc., but I was mainly looking for a way to track my spending.

It was easy to install and for the most part, is intuitive to use. I use a password to update my accounts which only takes about a minute or so to do. Initial imports required a lot of manual categorizing, but Quicken adjusts to how you want things categorized and all following imports required little manipulation. Of course, sometimes I have to go back and re-categorize transactions, but it doesn't take up too much time.

To me, the spending reports are invaluable. I can see exactly where my money goes - last month, last 3 months, etc. It's a great way to start some budget planning and beats tracking expenses manually. Like I said, there is a slew of other capabilities, but for me, even using it for my limited purpose is worth while."
"This is a tried and tested product of Peachtree - now renamed as Sage. I love the fact that it has easy installation and the ever so helpful wizards that in within the product. Not only that, they also have provide a contact service to call in case we need further assistance with the product.

This software can capture the snapshot of a company and present it in a easy to read and see form such as charts and graphs. I can look at it and tell what is the revenue the company is making, the vendors information - billing and collection etc. The best part, I can modify it to suit my needs and see which information needs my attention the most at the current moment. It even comes with Analysis tools which is useful for projections of the company in the short-mid term assessments.

It is so comprehensive that it can even do payroll and has the ability to allow for posting without closing the current Financial Year.

Great product for a small-medium sized company as it is not bulky like customized software such as SAP."
"I was excited about getting and reviewing this product, because I had recently bought an iPhone and wanted a good way to load movies on it.  I already been using an earlier version of another Roxio product, Popcorn.

So, let's say you're the average person who has a iPod or iPhone and wants to take those DVDs you have in your library and view them on your handheld wonder.  Roxio Crunch does that, right?  Wrong.  The legality of taking a DVD movie you own and making a digital copy for your own personal use is still in a legal gray area, so companies like Roxio won't touch it, so actually Crunch can't make copies of any standard copyrighted, copyprotected DVD you buy in a store.  Out of the box it's only good for home-movie DVDs you've made yourself. Now, if you can find another program that will copy the DVD onto your computer (into what is known as a video-ts folder), then Crunch will help.  Or it was supposed to.  I had trouble using it to convert a video ts folder I already had on my computer, and when I emailed their help desk they refused to help me once they learned that the video ts folder was of a copyrighted product. I tried converting another file and it converted, but the video and audio didn't properly sync.  And it gets worse.  Crunch is getting heavily promoted, but it is essentially just a stripped down version of Roxio's flagship product Popcorn 3, which is a much more powerful program for only ten bucks more.

So what did I end up doing?  I'm using HandBrake, a downloadable program that performs beautifully, has more options than Crunch, and will work on most copyrighted DVDs to boot.  And, oh, it's free."
love this shampoo
"I normally use Microsoft Office but thought I'd give Corel WordPerfect a try. I found it amazing how much more affordable Corel WordPerfect is when compared to Microsoft Office that can run in the hundreds. Installation was very easy and the software is good for up to 3 computers - which was a nice perk. The software includes:

WordPerfect - similar to Microsoft Word
Quattro Pro - similar to Excel
Presentations - similar to Power Point
WP Lighting  - similar to OneNote

Overall, I've found WordPerfect to be much more user friendly than Microsoft - functions are placed more intuitively, easier to find, etc. I often get frustrated with Microsoft when buttons are not where it would make sense for them to be. And WordPerfect documents can still be saved in Microsoft format for easy sending to others.

I'm a big Excel person so Quattro Pro was a bit difficult for me to adjust to, but WordPerfect and Presentations were extremely easy to switch to. WordPerfect has great capabilities  - like outlining documents - that Microsoft is lacking in."
"As a long time Quicken user, as well as a Beta tester, this is by far the best release in recent history.  The new features that allow monitoring of your credit score is a very nice feature but the X-Ray feature allows you to understand your investments to ensure that you are not under or over allocated in a particular sector.  I have been doing this manually but it is now a breeze with Quicken Premier 2015.

Also, if you haven't previously used the Quicken mobile app for tracking your spending with your mobile device, you will quickly learn to love this feature with the improvements in 2015.

This is by far the most stable Quicken I have tested and used and the improved interface makes it even easier to use."
"I did not want a PC download and ordered the other type. It is a key-card and requires a PC download. So, you can't get a CD (or DVD?) anymore looks like and Amazon spent a lot of money to send me a big empty box with a ""postcard"" in it... Not a problem, just really NOT efficent...
I do have a paper hard copy --  the card... Gotta love it..."
My son loved it!
Works well !
"WinZip 15 is available in two packages:  WinZip Standard and the full-featured WinZip Pro.  This review is of WinZip Standard which also came with WinZip Courier.

WinZip has won accolade after accolade since it was first introduced in 1991 for being one of the best file compression software packages.  If you are interested in compressing files to send as emails, to reduce the size of your archives or to save space on your computer, then you should certainly consider WinZip.  If you are thinking of upgrading from an earlier version of WinZip, you may want to question the advantages of doing so.

Compression Speed
I have been using WinZip 7 for years and so I expected much faster performance with WinZip 15, especially since WinZip advertises that version 15 has a brand new zip engine which requires less time to compress files.  However, I found that despite the new zip engine, the speed of the file compression was about the same as the older version that I had been using.  This may be a function of the age of my computer, but overall, the lack of any noticeable increase in speed was disappointing given the difference in the age of the versions I was using.  Therefore, I don't really see any real advantage of upgrading to WinZip 15 if you are using an older version of WinZip unless you can take advantage of the zipx file.

Zipx File
When using WinZip 15 to compress files, the user has the option of choosing the legacy compression (zip file) or the zipx file which was introduced in WinZip 12.  Zipx offers the advantage of creating smaller compressed files.  However, while zip files can be opened by most compression utilities including the one installed with Windows, zipx files can only be opened by WinZip 12 or later or by a few other compression utilities.  Therefore, zipx files are not as ideal for compressing files you plan to share with others.  To see the difference between the zip and zipx files, I zipped the contents of the My Documents folder which included photos and other multimedia.  The zip file resulted in 25% compression while the zipx file resulted in 33% compression.  However, I have also tried compare the results of compressing Word documents which have lots of images included.  I found that the zipx compression resulted in files that were actually slightly larger than the comparable zip files. The same also happened when I tried to zip mp3 files.  However, in the case of jpeg files, zipx files are 20% smaller than the original or the zip file.  While the advantage of the zipx file is not staggering, it is an improvement if you are creating files for archiving, especially if the archive includes JPEGs.

Installation on Two Computers
It is permissible to install the single license version of WinZip on two computers, as long as they are not used simultaneously.  The exact wording from the WinZip user agreement is:  ""If you have purchased a single-user license you have the right to install and use a single copy of WinZip on one computer or workstation for non-simultaneous use by one or more persons and install a second copy of WinZip on another computer or workstation for the exclusive use of the person who is the primary user of the first copy of WinZip.""

Interface
WinZip gives the option of using the Wizard or the Classic interface.  The Wizard is easy to use and takes the user through simple steps and questions to zip or unzip files.  The classic view includes many more options including 128- and 256-bit key password protection for the zipped files.  It is also possible to zip and unzip files by right clicking on the files in the Windows Explorer.

File Types
In addition to compressing files, WinZip opens and extracts content from the industry's widest selection of compressed file types, including Zip, Zipx, RAR, 7Z, BZ2, LHA, CAB, IMG, ISO, and most other file archive formats.

Email
Click on the mail button in the WinZip interface and WinZip will automatically open your default mail program (including Outlook and web based email such as Hotmail or Gmail).  In the case of Hotmail, I would have expected the first page which is opened to be the page for composing emails.  This is the case if you are already logged into Hotmail, but if you are not, the first page you see is the inbox.  I then had to close the browser page and click on email again in WinZip to start the message composition, but although the subject line of the message had the file name, I found that the file was not attached.  It may just be that WinZip and Hotmail using Internet Explorer do not play well together, but this was a bit disappointing.

Courier
WinZip 15 Standards includes a copy of Courier which automatically zips all files attached to an outgoing email. Courier is great if you regularly email compressed files or photos.  The supported email clients include Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express, Windows Mail, Gmail and Hotmail.  When you attach files to an email, the standard dialogue box appears which allows you to choose the file to attach.  Courier adds to this window, controls to zip, encrypt or to resize photos which is a useful tool.  There is the option to make zipping files the default which would be useful if you send zipped files quite often, but annoying if you don't want to always zip files and forget that Courier will do this automatically.

Summary
If you don't currently own a compression utility and you would like to compress files for archiving, emailing or to save space on your computer, then you should definitely consider WinZip 15.  The Wizard interface makes zipping files easy for even novice users and the classic interface includes a lot of options for those who want more control of the process. However, if you are considering upgrading from a version of WinZip prior to version 12, you may want to reconsider unless you can take advantage of the compression of JPEG files using the zipx format."
"This is very easy video editing software. Depending on what level you're starting at, you'll likely find what you want. It goes from basically the software does all the thinking to advanced beginner to intermediate. There are tutorials on their site to get you started, but really you should be able to do at least a basic video or slide show right out of the box."
"I like Quicken products and this is no exception. In my case it has a lot of features that I didn't need. This version provides a free ebook of Nolo's Encyclopedia of Everyday Law and an one year subscription to its Online Living Trust which I was glad it did. I also signed up to be a complete organ donor, the brain has to be donated separately, and I hope using my body to practice on helps to save the life of some creature. Another plus was the paperback book, The Legal Answer Book for Families, which I skimmed through since none of that information was needed at this time. They also offer another version of this product with a more comprehensive paperback that you may want to compare before purchasing. Keep in mind you can upgrade with this from previous versions of Quicken WillMaker, WillMaker Deluxe, and Quicken Lawyer Personal, from 2002 to 2014, as each is only valid for the year it was produced and each year has pertinent legal updates. Also these estate planning documents are not valid in Louisiana, U.S. Territories or Canada. For the amount of information you get for this price, it's a great deal. The only reason I deducted one star is I think the other book version is easier for those somewhat lacking in computer skills. Just take your time and you'll be glad like me that you chose one of their WillMaker products."
"""Nancy Drew: Secret of the Old Clock"" is open captioned, and, I might add, the captions are very nicely done. Even sounds, like phones ringing or explosions, are captioned, much like we expect from TV. I just wish that the mud puddles and the potholes in the road had their sounds captioned since they're important; I suffered several flat tires before I happened to turn the sound up and heard that those ""spots on the screen"" might have meaning.

 While I readily admit to having had ""differences"" with Nancy Drew manufacturers, and have been downright furious with them at times, this isn't one of them. LOL. The game works perfectly, even with Vista, and without having to make the computer pretend it has XP."
I have been using apple computers for many years and I like most of the features they offer. However like a tic on a hound you will find like most other computer systems you must update in order to use many features on your computer. Example you buy Ilife 06 only to find that when your computer system updates a couple years later and you purchase a Iphone you must go get Ilife 09 to use some of the features in Iphoto. I am not sold on the changes made on Ilife 09. The vendor I got it from did a great job of selling the product for what it is really worth.
Good!!
"Well, let me tell ya!

This little thing is like an encyclopedia of information.  It's amazingly handy and interesting when you're researching different locations.  More than that, information I might have about places can be thrown on here easily, organized, and used.  Easily.

Manipulating and moving information to other systems, programs, even your cell phone, is trivially easy.  Making routes and scheduling meetings makes a lot of sense.  I never thought of it this way before, but many things on my schedule can be planed on a map now.  I can save time and organize what I'm doing to reduce my traveling.  This is the core of the program: planning things in real space and real time.  You can have a complex plan, simplify what it looks like, and everything is easy to understand and change.

Many aspects of the interface are head smackingly obvious yet huge improvements.  Back and forward buttons on a map.  Great!  Almost like surfing the web.

This is a terrific product and while I usually have a problem with MS's decisions for interfaces, this is really something I would recommend to anyone who would manages information about locations, travels, or just has a busy life.

The best feature is that this is a lot of fun to do.  It certainly doesn't feel like work!"
"Like many others, I was disappointed that this OS version was geared toward mobile use, and left us desktop/laptop users out in the cold. We are moving into the era where most people will carry a smartphone and will pay monthly fees to get their music, storage, office suits, and other applications through the cloud. I detest that, and I hate to see that this OS does not perform as well as I would like for it to, for my purposes. That said, it works, other than I am being forced once more to buy some new software versions of old products because my old ones don't work on this. Welcome to the world of paying a monthly fee for everything ""computer"" related."
"It's really kind of hard for me to evaluate PSP X8 fairly because I find I'm always comparing it to Painter 2016.  I use the latter a lot, the former... it simply doesn't do as much as either Painter, or Photoshop Effects.  And that's fine, considering the vast difference in price points between it and the others.  It's at the low end of the image manipulation range, and for that reason alone it deserves kudos, so let's talk about it from that point of view.

This is a program the average user is going to love having.  It does a heck of a lot of cool stuff to your photos.  There's a quick adjust tab which includes a lot of very basic fixes like noise removal, vibrancy, brightness and contrast and the like.  The edit tab takes things a few steps further with resizing, photo effects, cropping, and even layers.  It's a fairly sophisticated package for the home user, and if the effects aren't as finely tuned, as in a more expensive program, or the controls aren't as easy to master, it's really a small thing for the value you're getting

I can tell you that it works just fine in Windows 10 on my laptop, though it's a bit slow.  Again, not a huge problem compared to the value you're getting.  My best advice to you is to figure out what it is you'd want to use an image program for and buy accordingly.  If you're simply not sure, then start with PSP and see if you strain its abilities.  If so, you can always move up."
"Bought this on sale.  I have been using McAfee for years.  My current subscription had lapsed and found this at a decent price.  When I went to install it, it would not allow me to register.  Nothing that McAfee CS would (could??) do fixed it.  I have an i7 with 12 GB ram and 2 TB HD running a current Win7, so it's not the hardware or OS.

Found a competitor's product on sale that installed without a problem and even offers some upgrades that this version of McAfee doesn't so will stick with them until they have a Customer Service department that can't get the job done."
"THE QUICK TAKE:  There's a real need for a product like this - something easy to use that will get all those photos off everyone's cameras and hard drives, and get the photos organized, edited, and shared.  Something to realize some of the promise of managing your photos electronically.  But sadly in practice Corel PhotoShop isn't that product - the emphasis and execution are off the mark.

THE FULL REVIEW:  The description of Corel PhotoShop Express 2010 really caught my interest. A program that could help me do a quick retouch, as well as organize my backlog of photos, could really be useful.  Digital photography makes it easy to take lots of photos, but more people are realizing the challenge of managing all those photos after the shot.

I've done a lot of photography and photography projects, and used Adobe Photoshop and Paintshop Pro quite a bit.  I like them both for different reasons, but there are a few key needs I'd come to realize weren't being met:
- Sometimes I needed to do a quick retouch with a handful of tools, and at times the plethora of features of those more complicated programs just got in the way.
- Those programs were also no help for organizing and tagging the backlog of photos.
- Getting the photos uploaded (to share or print) can be time consuming.

I think lots of people have some similar needs.  So, a great idea, right?

Unfortunately the reality is a little jarring, at least for me.  I'm used to having some say about what is installed, and how, and how the program handles my files.  I also like to know what's going on - for example, when I click update, I'd like to know if there is an update, and how large, so I could decide when to update.  I only found out it was updating when I quit the program.

INSTALLATION:  I'm pretty tolerant of programs that need a lot of time and space to install, especially imaging programs - the input and output devices make it complicated.  Getting it right is what counts.  But 2+GB, really?  That's somewhere between 100 and 1000 times larger than some of my favorite imaging programs.  (A lot of the time seemed to be spent on configuring Microsoft's .NET framework - another product that seemed like a great idea but is cumbersome in practice.  And, it installs the Windows Media Encoder ... which might be great for some, but I have no plans to use it.)  Luckily System Restore will unwind this mess.

INTERFACE:  The user interface is very attractive, if cryptic and limited.  There are very few choices, tools or options.  (That may be a pro or a con, depending on your point of view.)  The help files are somewhat limited, but may be adequate for those likely to use this program.

FILE SEARCH: When you first start up PaintShop Photo, it starts searching for files.  Unfortunately, that's not what I wanted it to do, and not only could I not find a way to stop it, it didn't provide any update on how the search was proceeding, or where it was searching.  It ought to ask whether to do that, or to let the user manually import.

EDITING FEATURES:  The editing features are simply too limited.  Given the computer resources this product consumers, they could easily have included a broader range of features.  I'm not sure why they thought it was important to add a lot of video features, but give short shrift to the image editing - a good example of how they missed in emphasis.

BOTTOM LINE:  This might be a reasonable product for someone who is primarily interested in organizing and then sharing or printing photos; for whom editing is a low priority; who doesn't feel the need to know what the software is doing to your files; and who likes a program that will go ahead and make decisions without asking for input.  That's pretty much the opposite of me.  But if that's you, and you have a powerful computer - it may be a fit, and it has a very attractive and simplistic user interface."
Always happy with Norton products. Very pleased with this item I ordered.
"so, cute in the CHRISTMAS STOCKINGS"
I buy this every year in December so I can plan out my tax year. The program is very well written for people like me to use. I would have to pay a professional if not for TurboTax.
"Do not buy this software unless you want: an installation headache, frequent computer crashes, a heavy drain on memory and super slow computer speed, and choppy video playback. And just for reference I am running an upgraded Dell XPS with Windows 7. There is no reason for a program like this to turn my computer into the sluglike machine it became with Cyberlink installed."
"The tech specs say that Windows XP Pro is sufficient.  WRONG!  Windows XP Pro is insufficient unless Service Pack 2 has been installed.  Neither of my two laptops will accept Service Pack 2, so this product is useless to me.  False advertising!"
"I happily used ATI (Acronis True Image) for years with XP, and ONLY used it for full image Backups/Restores (I beta test Security Products, and a 30yr software tech).
I upgraded (?) to Win 7 (32), and needed  new Image Backup Software (ATI had growing pains with Win 7 at first)
 I ""Mistakenly"" went to G15 (Ghost 15)!

G15 worked pretty good for normal Backup/Restores, but when my HD (Hard Drive) crashed! It would not copy my Validated Backup to my new HD!?-
G15's ""clueless"" outsourced free chat tech support was no help, and wanted to ""upgrade"" me to paid/no-guarantee support? NOT! Grrr! Full System Restore!

There was no way to post comments on the G15 backups, so you look at the dates & try & remember the system state...? ( In ATI you create the Backup, go to Recovery, and Right click on the new file/Edit Comments/Detailed...)!
~~~~~~~~~~~~
BTW!- WD (#1 Western Digital) & Seagate both have free downloads of  basic ATI (Backup/Restore only, which is all I like anyway!- Browse their websites!), but you MUST have ""one"" of their drives installed on your system (mix is OK, but I had Hitachi, and since ""upgraded"" to WD Black on my laptop!)!
~~~~~~~~~~~~
I then upgraded to ATI trial, but it did not have all the available features of paid/registered.

NOTE!-I don't like the Incremental File/Image Backups on either G15 or ATI!-
Every time you defrag, they see this as a file change!- Backups recopy & Quickly become HUGE/SLOW!
Only do New/Full backups (I keep last 3, and 1st after a fresh System Restore!)!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
""My"" 100% Tried-n-True ATI Backup/Restore Procedure(adapt for G15 too, and I'd Print/save... it!!)!-

- For Backups- I fresh defrag ""after"" a fresh no-activity reboot.
I wait 8min, then defrag (all files are released). Free MyDefrag is GREAT, but you MUST disable Win defrag by searching for services.msc & Right click/Run as admin(same with most Any 3d party defrag!), and then two no-activity 4min wait reboots!

 -Wait 4min & ""temp disable your AV!"", wait 4 more min (HD light has now stopped flashing?), and do your Backup/Restore! Right click ATI & Run as Admin (ANY ATI... procedure! Win 7/Vista, blocks system changes!)!
Wait 2min after every closing of ATI, for the first no-activity reboot (it's slow to release files!).
-For Backups- Wait 4min, and do a normal reboot. Go into Recovery, Right click on the new backup, and Validate/Reboot!

-For Recovery- Wait 4min & do a Reboot
Wait 4min & Shutdown (not many system changes are ""fully"" complete, until After a cold startup!?)!

Note!- ""After"" you have registered ""either"" Trial, be sure & go into Tools, and cut a New Emergency Boot CD (In case your HD crashes... Trial CD will not copy to a new HD!).
~~~
On a new HD copy...,  if you ever get a message about a bad BOOTmgr...!-
Reboot from your Win CD/Repair System...,  and Repair Start Up, ""3"" separate times!

Done!
~~~
Yea!- I know This is Very time consuming, but it works ""100%"" for me (learned it the Hard Way!)!
Sure Beats a System Restore!"
"I really like this software. You are able to sort, tag, categorize and edit all of your photos in one place. The interface is very well designed. Nothing is too confusing or to easy, either. Facebook, Myspace or other online photo integration would be a definite plus."
Another but modernizing standard read.
Good light scent. Have received complements from people that I smell nice after using it. 3 stars because bottle is kind of small for a shower gel (size compariso photo attached) and it doesnt really help me wake up in the morning like other products.
Beautiful I love them comfy
"I edited my first digital video project with the original version of iMovie a number of years ago. That really spoiled me. It was intuitive and not overly complicated. I put together a really nice video clip that looked pretty darn professional. Since then I have tried about 6 PC video editing software packages including Studio 9 and 10 and a couple smaller packages. This one comes closest to that ""perfect"" software. Fairly intuitive, it was easy to figure out how to do most things, but not all, and the book that came with it was useless in helping me figure out how to edit sound clips. After about an hour or two I finally managed to open the sound editing feature, but later I had to stumble about trying to find it again. In general, this is the best PC based video software I've had the pleasure to use. Maybe you'll have less trouble figuring out the subtleties than I did."
"Having used Quicken in the various encarnations, I will say that I like the product.  Why give it a poor rating you say?  My main issue with quicken is that the product is great until you get to the end of life which is usually 2 to 3 yrs and then most of the functionality of it becomes useless, which in fact, forces you to upgrade.

Quicken 2013 seems to be very buggy as well and has had 10 updates since its initial release.  One I found right away was trying to convert a graph to a pdf file to save, that is buggy at best and doesnt appear to work properly.  As long as this program has been around you would think that the bugs have been worked out by now.

Utilize online banking, its cheaper and does most of what this does these days anyways."
I loved it.
"Before I get into a review, let me state that I have ALWAYS been pro-Microsoft.  Despite all the monopolizing and heavy-handedness and rushed updates, I have always felt they did more good than harm.  I have yet to find a Microsoft product I didn't like... until now.

In a word, Microsoft Money 2005 is ""horrible"".  I only gave it 2 stars because it still beats paper and pen :)

Now, if you're a new user, you probably won't notice anything bad about it and will continue on your merry way.  Bravo for you (just don't do anything online until they release the second patch (yes, there's already one out) since 2005 is apparently quite broken with respect to about 50% of the institutions it claims to support).

If you're a previous Money user, pocket your $30 and invest it, using your old version to track the savings.  I was terribly disappointed in 2005.  To begin with, helpful features such as Bill Minder, ""dual category lists"", ""in-register"" spending forecast and upcoming bills, are gone.  What have they been replaced with?  I have no clue.  As far as I can tell, they've replaced them with a HUGE toolbar (a la MSN Explorer but without the option to resize) and a LOT of white space (the register displays about 30 lines max (on ""compressed"" view) and runs literally down to the bottom of the screen.)

The home page actually displays less information (though it is prettier in a way) and the settings ""menu"" is a fiasco (again, much like MSN Explorer) with numerous hyperlinks that are not necessarily intuitive.

From what I could tell, reconciliation seemed to work as expected, but seemed to offer less information than 2003 did.  I did not even take the time to get into investing since I uninstalled 2005 within 24 hours (and I am, without doubt, a ""give it time"" kind of person).  I honestly felt like I had less control over my finances (or at least less information with which to make informed decisions) and didn't want to risk botching up my portfolio.

That's about it.  I know it's a short review and probably leaves many questions unanswered, but I had only invested 24 hors in 2005 so a ""roll back"" to 2003 was fairly straightforward (and evidently necessary).  To take more time would have meant a more difficult reversal.  Again, I normally like MS products, but I can promise you this one will be going back to Redmond at their expense (30-day Money Back Guarantee).

I would STRONGLY recommend against buying Money 2005.  It just isn't worth the money (I honestly wouldn't even take it free now).  I can see no enhanced functionality and it actually appears reduced in places.  The interface has been radically changed and, aside from being pretty, actually reduced my sense of ""control"" over my finances.  Again, if you're brand new to Microsoft Money, I think you'll be satisfied.  However, if you're a previous user... well... you've been warned...

PS Did I tell you that Money automatically (read: ""Did not ask"") reorganized my categories?  It decided to treat ""Dining out"" as its own primary category instead of as a subcategory of ""Food"", effectively reorganizing over 100 transactions.  This might have been OK if Money had asked, but it didn't.  Makes me wonder what else was changed without my approval..."
I love these shoes.  They fit as expected and they look really nice on.  These shoes have a narrow base which I really like.  I don't like the ones that make your foot look wide.
"My specific use for this software is to read quotes and notes into a word processor for my lectures. It worked very well for this.

Pros:

Easily loaded into my Windows 7 64bit system
Easy to use.
Works fine with the free software OPEN OFFICE. If you don't have a supported word processor you can still easily use it.
Profile setup was quick and worked well.

Cons:

Asks for permisison to go through your emails looking for names. You can refuse this, just be sure you read what it is asking you to do and not just check ""yes"" to hurry the install.
The program asks to have access to all of your emails and then asks if it can send data home on use. I found this invasive and declined both.

Registration was a waste of time. In order to get updates and other goodies you had to give permission to be contacted by PHONE, MAIL and EMAIL. Most software asks for a preferred contact style. This one opens the door to getting calls and junk mail from Nuance and its associates. At that point, since I value my privacy I unchecked the contact permission. Then I couldn't get the letter in the spam prevention box to take no matter how many times I refreshed them. I ended up aborting the process since there was no real point in registering unless I agreed to be contacted."
Thank you!!
"As others have noted, Clipart&More ""3.5 Million Clipart, Fonts, Photos, & More"" is not really all of that great for direct installation on the computer, but it does included a very worthwhile one year subscription to their web site that has some 7.8 million clipart images, fonts, sounds, photos, and videos. We produce a lot of advertising, brochures, and signage for our small business and having access to this many graphics is very helpful.

The quality of the media from the site ranges from very basic to professional quality and is fairly easy to search and access once you sign up.

Recommended, but only for the on-line content.

"Several years ago (2002) I grew tired of Norton programs and discovered that my Windows PC actually ran better without Norton Systems Works than it did with it, so long as I used a virus program. Works seemed to find non existent problems and used lots of resources. Since Norton Anti-Virus cost just about the same price as Systems works did I opted for one of the free anti-virus programs (Avast) and was very happy. I also have a Mac and use no Norton software on it.

Recently I obtained a new HP Vista computer and was happily running Avast on it with no problems. But I missed several programs I had on my XP system that did things like defrag my hard drive, keep track of my passwords, etc. So when this program became available in the Amazon Vine program and I noticed it had those separate programs that I had by other companies now incorporated all into one program called Norton 360 I decided to give it a try.

I had no problem loading the software and it seemed to configure effortlessly upon it's first start up. I've used all of the features on it thus far except the backup program. I am unclear as if the backup only works to the skimpy on-line disc space that comes with the product (more can be rented for what seems a fairly astronomical price). The features of the program seem to work well so far in all the areas I have tried.

I've read many of the other reviews for this program and it seems I may be praising it too soon since I've only had it installed about 3 weeks so far (on a 6 week old PC) and it seems that things begin to go sour shortly after that - we'll see. I would agree that it seems to work best with new computers with fresh Vista installations (Ultimate version in my case on a 6 week old PC). It seems to incur all sorts of problems on older systems with Vista upgrades.

So I'm taking a cautious approach and think that it's an average program that tries to do a lot, and if you have  the need or desire for these features and a fairly new computer it will probably work well for you. I can't speak for what your experience with older computers would be like."
As described...it's a gift card!
"When I tried to install this it wanted me to uninstall my other spyware and addware, which I wasn't too happy about since those worked pretty good and were just out dated. After removing my other programs I tried to install this, and my laptop stalled out. I finally had to remove the battery to shut it down. I should have left it alone at that point but I thought I should try it one more time. Same thing, part way into the install m laptop stalled again. Again the only way to get it shut down was to pull the battery. This time I had all sorts of problems because the system files were damaged. I finally had to get the Dell tec support to take over control of my laptop to find the problems and fix it. At least it was still covered with the warranty. This was the second time that I've had a anti virus program screw up my computer when I tried to install it. I don't know if its because of a problem with the program or with the Windows Vista on my laptop. I'm more incliend to say its a problem with the Vista."
I am so pleased with the PrintMaster Platinum Version 18. I bought it for myself and have really enjoyed using this product. I would recommend it to anyone who loves to do graphics with their computer.
"I'm devastated that this fragrance has been discontinued. I would love to see P&G bring it back, even if as an occasional ""anniversary"" run; I'd scoop up extras. As it is, I paid 2 1/2 times per bottle in order to gather as many as the budget would allow. Old Spice Foxcrest, you've served our family well."
"Smells good but doesn't contain any real lavender essential oil.  I also found it to be drying.  Soon as I dried off I could feel the skin on my legs tightening up.  Now, I use moisturizing creams, butters, lotions or oils everyday but I still don't want to use a drying body wash.  Why stress my skin unnecessarily?  For that reason, I wouldn't buy this again."
This product allows the average hobbyist to catalog and edit photos easily.  It is a straight forward application that is easily learned and used.  One of the problems with any photo program is that they don't present accurate color.  This is primarily due to monitors not the application with which it is manipulated.  A key point is to know your printer and calibrate it with your monitor.  I can highly recommend this application for those who are looking for an inexpensive photo cataloging and simple editing program
"I was really hoping this scent would be true to it's name, and that it would smell of redcurrant and basil.  Wearing it, I smell neither one of those scents (both of which I love); it just smells generically perfumey on me.  I love the idea of a redcurrant/basil scent, but this is not it.  Your mileage may vary of course, but I highly recommend a test run before buying."
The software is very easy to use which is fine but my biggest requirement was GEDCOM support.  GEDCOM is the open standard for family tree data.  Do if you need to move the data to another program in the future you should be safe.
There was a discount on the card but then there was like S & H charges so it ended up costing more than the amount on the card.
"I have always been a Turbo Tax user but after their feature removal this year I decided to try H&R Block. I didn't like the program as much. It seems less polished than Turbo Tax though it did easily import last year's Turbo Tax generated data and it seemed to cover the bases. My only problem is that H&R Block's software didn't seem to know what to do with my minister's housing allowance. I came to a stalemate because the program insisted on me entering an amount of wages for my minister's W-2 but I don't get regular wages, everything is classified as housing. Turbo Tax didn't have a problem. H&R Block is good but I find Turbo Tax a better product."
I use this software every day to keep up with my personal finances. Getting the newest version every year gives me the confidence that I have the newest tools available for my needs. The 2015 software isn't a great leap forward from 2014. It's more of an evolution. I don;t see any OMG new features. But it's still a solid product.
"I tried to upgrade from XP to Vista. I have a very powerful PC - 3GB and dual core processor and sufficient graphic card - but Vista only does about 90% of what it should be doing. Two major problems are after installing vista I can not deinstall firewalls and virus scanners that don't work under vista but that keep screwing up my system. Second big thing, I have two computer screens and the second screen is turned by 90 degrees. Vista does not like that at all. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DON'T INSTALL VISTA. IT IS NOT WORTH THE NIGTHMARE."
"I must admit to still being on a learning curve with this product, but it has an amazing set of capabilities.
When installing the Power Director 13, Make sure you read the EULA, I cannot emphasize that enough.
The Power Director has Many editing tools, and the thought that springs to mind is maybe it has too many or too much in the way of tools; with some products you feel like saying, just focus on a few things that you do well, and do that or do those.

In the Install process, it asks ""do you want to install Smart Sound"", and this is a no brainer; quite a good add-on, and works well with other products.
I favour the use of Still photos, and making them ""pop"" for want of a better phrase, and there-in lies my learning curve. You can use video from the SAMSUNG memory cam which is really for basic Video. Some quite good video can be obtained from the Canon Eos T5, and then you just edit. If you have Photo shop, this can work some wonders , since a live shot with reminisces  of other times, or maybe some people who have passed, can be trasnitioned in as the person on the video talks. When you use this, Audio tracks work wonders; you can have a basic music track, and then if you have audio of the person who has passed, or other people talking about a person ( alive or passed ), then this product can transition the audio, and the images. So cool.

Make sure that you have plenty of memory, and if needs be, use a dedicated PC or , laptop or desktop, with at least 12 gig ( mine has 12 ) so that you can easily edit the large slab of content. If you have less than 12 gig of ram, use more virtual memory, and shut down unnecessary applications so you can grab all the available CPU and memory. I am not a fan of the Cloud option, so forget that, in my view. And use a second drive. If you have a SSD drive, use that for your virtual, especially if you can link that in with a USB 3 cable.

All in all this is a great editing set. Also, if you really feel like using the second disc with optional extras, be careful, since it chews up CPU and memory like crazy.
The capability is immense, but make sure you have the tools to use this great product . Some of the specs for memory and CPU on the box seem more than a tad optimistic, and I would say that easily you would need to double it. I have had problems at times with 12 Gig, and I was being careful. The 3 D options are neat. Also, use a Blue Screen or neutral colour backdrop for some elements you want to import, especially if you do a kind of interview scenario for the PIP ( picture in Picture) elements. If you read the guides and use your imagination, this tool, plus some great extras like Tascam portable audio recording ( 2 and 4 channel options) make for a ""skies the limit"" type of ability. As you can probably tell, I love the item. Some limitations, but not enough to make it badm, just don't expect an AVID style editor."
"My favorite perfume ever...
Pretty bottles, and arrived pretty quick.  :)"
"TURBOTAX is everything it is advertised to be.

I started using TurboTax in 2002 and have used it every year since. As my tax situation has grown more complicated with investments and a business, it has more than met my needs. It is easy-to-use, complete, and hassle-free.

I take comfort in knowing that it doesn't overlook deductions, credits, or expenses. Once I have gone through the interview process (which is ridiculously simple), I know I have touched all the bases.

Its Deductible is so good I bought it outright a couple of years ago. For charitable donations of clothes, mileage, and money it is excellent. To have a software package that properly values a short sleeve silk women's blouse in good condition is worth it's weight in gold.

TurboTax has saved me money on taxes and given me peace of mind."
works perfectly
"As usual,  this bath gel was just as good as expected."
"I used Norton Utilities regularly until about 5 years ago.  I got this and installed it.  Not sure what it did exactly, except it slowed my system horribly, and disrupted my browser (IE8).  I couldn't tolerate it anymore, so I uninstalled it."
"Win7. What is there to say? It is a god solid well tested OS.
I like it better than Win8 since I use a desktop and have NO touch screen."
very useful
Upgraded to Windows 8 from a very stable Windows 7 systematic.  Now my computer constantly crashes and is plagued by several issues like I cannot shutdown without using the power button.  I feel like i am a beta tester.
"I actually have the previous version loaded on my computer as well, but having so many interruptions this year, I never used it.  I went to a video learning company to see how this version 7 works, about two weeks ago, so I could give this review a better shot.

1. The reason I wanted it in the first place:  I bought a video of a man painting a portrait in Corel Painter.  He uses a transparent background in SketchBook, to do a very (blacks, greys, and whites) lifelike rendering of a man with curly hair, a long, scraggly beard, and amazing features that make artists drool.  He showed how he imports the sketch into Painter, and with layers, he paints the man, lifelike, while erasing the sketch a bit at a time.

2. I wanted software to do renderings (just sketching with black, grey, and white values), and under-paintings, on a less memory-intensive app.  This is a big deal, because I leave a lot of apps running (Photoshop, Painter, Browser with tabs, my calender, and sometimes videos with stop action to remind myself to watch them on my iMac.

3. I was told it is very easy to draw with; I have shaky hands, and, even with a large tablet and pen, I cannot draw a decent curve or straight line.

It is very easy, relatively to draw portraits, or other symmetrical, and semi-symmetrical renderings from life.  As others may have done, I will try to not use technical terms, because I intend to describe their functions, and what they result in (what the results look like), because I get so lost when I hear software-specific technical terms.

This app has traditional-like tools that Photoshop and Painter do not have, like a french curve, for example (which is what artists use to make perfect curves). If you wanted to draw a perfect rounded corner rectangle - to make the rounded edges have perspective.

Let's say you have to make the rectangle, and you want all sides to be the same - there is a tool that will let you draw one part, while the other part draws it's self.  Very cool.

There is a mechanism in the app that lets you draw, not only horizontal and vertical straight lines in either direction, but it enables you to draw a perfect diagonal line.

Let's say you wanted to put an oval or circle with a straight line through the middle; it can be done with the app, without worrying about shaky hands.

If you draw, you would likely know how handy this is.  And a time-saver as well.

It's a pretty intuitive interface - if you realize that some tools are sort of hidden, as on the top-right of the vertical toolbox on the left side of the screen (as it is positioned right after you load it for the first time), there is a small box, you will find the special pens there in all their vibrant colors, that Anime and Mange characters have been created with from where they originated.  (If you want SketchBook just for these type of pens you can download it for free - just search for it.  I don't see any reason, though, to deny yourself all these traditional-like drawing and coloring tools, unless the price point is too steep for you. Flexible pay-as-you-go, and Cloud-based services are available on your desktop for a lower up-front price.

There are all kinds of pens, markers, erasers, pencils that you can customize, and save special as you wish.  It might take you awhile though, to start customizing, as you will have a whole lot of tools already!  Don't forget there are tool tips when you hover over tools and drawing media. You can find a whole bunch of features listed if you go to preferences.  I forget hearing about this in the educational video, but I think the mark-making tools like brushes, etc. are pressure-sensitive with something like a Wacom Tablet.  There are inexpensive ones, and not just Wacom is compatible.  Drawing with a mouse plain old doesn't work well with these types of apps.

Much like in other illustration or design apps, colors can be altered in many ways - or should I say, manipulated.  If you go to preferences you will see how opaque or as rich and bright your colors can be.  You will also find other features that you will most likely find in Photoshop or Painter.  Of course, you can change how many undos, there are selection tools, move, edit, rotate, and scale layers, and so many more features.

There is a toolbar at the top as well as a semicircle of tools - making a total of 5 ways to control the app - if you include your top menu bar, and the preferences.  Click around.  It is impressive for the money.  You can even control where your toolbars go.  Of course, you can push the TAB key on your keyboard and hide everything except the image you are working on.

There is a way to set your image size and, the default file format is tiff., which is a smaller, but decent quality file.  This can be exported into a .tiff, jpeg, .bmp, Pixir PSD, or of course an Adobe Photoshop PSD, which imports nicely into Painter or PS.

Of course - layers to build your sketches, making each layer a different part of the sketch.  To newbies, read documentation of some kind. Search for it online.

And more below:

New features -

There are Perspective Guides to easily lay down perfect 1-point, 2-point, 3-point, and fisheye perspective (if you don't know about artistic perspective - search online)
Also,the flipbook animation tool for expressing motion in sketches - WOW!
And, there is an enhanced layer editor, including expanded blend modes and layer grouping. Blend modes are  effects that you can make specific to separate layers; and, if you want, you can separate a group of layers from other layers to save you time, scrolling to organize and streamline layers.
The dynamic flood fills with solid, linear, and radial gradients - Gradients are two or more colors blending into each other.  Nice fill for backgrounds, making painted-looking drawings look nice - like making a sun look like it is white hot in the center, radiating out to yellow and maybe orange.  Sunsets.  Skies.
The distort transform tool to adjust and position perspective - you can reshape your graphics.
And, finally, improved selection control with polyline and magic wand selection - this means if you want to isolate and manipulate one part of your image, there are tools to do it better.

Highly recommended ""lighter"", but powerful software, with a very attractive interface, workable between multiple apps.  Highly recommended."
Was good
a very good buy !!
Easiest way to do your taxes. I have done mine and 3 friends taxes every year.
Christmas gift for a nephew.  I ordered this tin so I could add an additional gift card.  It is large enough to hold more than one and he did not know he was receiving two cards in one tin.
"Great Magazine, lots of good suggestions and ideas."
"It has been a while since I moved out of NYC, and there are times I wish I hadn't left. The New Yorker keeps me up to date with every aspect that makes New York the most eclectic city in the world. I get the news, political columns, book reviews, and the latest trends in fashion. Also, the New Yorker is one of the few magazines that still publishes fiction. I love reading the short stories they publish! The New Yorker has staying power -- and I shall continue to subscribe to this intelligent and edgy magazine for many years to come."
"I have been a beta tester for Quicken (Windows) for a number of years.  Each year I think ""I don't think anything can be improved over last year's.""  And each year new additions and improvements are made.  I have been using the final version for a month and I have no complaints and I am very happy with its performance.

"This suite has a lot of positives.  For starters, bitdefender has great malware detection rates, consistently ranking near the top in independent tests.  Offering a 2 year subscription instead of the standard 1 year offered by competitors is a great value as well.

The suite itself has plenty of features to protect users from multiple angles.  While some features, such as gamer mode, can be a bit gimmicky feeling, things like hourly updates and the ability to manage multiple PCs through one interface are excellent.  The online storage was a bit disappointing, 2gb is small to begin with, and many users received only 250mb instead of the advertised 2gb.  The system is thankfully very light on system resources, much better than the bloated ""big 2"" of antivirus software.

Unfortunately the suite still doesn't feel like a mature product.  There are too many bugs an issues to rely on full time.  Not only do updates sometimes fail, but even more frustratingly, some settings continue to revert to default despite repeatedly setting them!  Other changes are automatically set and can ruin home networks and email setups, as noted by other reviewers.

While bitdefender seems like a good company and this software is a good start, I'd wait for a later version when the kinks have been ironed out."
"To register this software you must call a number and be subjected to an extreme sales pitch to upgrade. After that you find that this is a page publisher like MS Publisher to create newsletters etc. There are some useful features but it will feel clunky to those used to the Microsoft interface or even Photoshop Elements etc.

Overall, this is a good entry level software if you can avoid the registration hassle. I'd evaluate the free trial version before going in for the purchase."
"Let me say up front that the only programs I care about in this package are Word and Excel.  Frankly, I do not see much improvement in either program versus the 2011 version.  If you don't HAVE to get the new version (say for file compatibility with coworkers or customers) I would suggest you pass on this version."
I brought this as a gift. It smells great. I love the price!
"BEFORE YOU UPGRADE: stop by the Microsoft website and run the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant (link in the comments). This program will comb through your system and offer you detailed analysis of what will and won't upgrade. It offers links to articles that explain in detail what you may need to do, and it can save you a lot of headaches. For example, I have a laptop with no USB drivers--yet! I now have a link to the manufacturer's website that I've bookmarked and when drivers become available I'll upgrade that machine too.

Windows 7 has been a well-received OS, so the case for upgrading to Windows 8 has been difficult for Microsoft to make. I've been using Windows 8 for a while now, and it truly is a mixed bag. The easiest way to explain the difference is to say, ""Your Start Menu is now full-screen"": we have a ""Modern UI"" (formerly called ""Metro"") that's designed to give you a splash of tiles, each of which represents a program on your machine. When you want to find a specific program or setting, you just start typing and the results filter themselves accordingly right before your eyes. Icons are now displayed as tiles of varying widths across your field of view and you scroll left-to-right to look through them. Some of this makes sense in that some of today's programs are more like the Windows Desktop Gadgets we've seen in Vista and 7: rather than needing to be launched, they idly stream information to you, and need a bit more room to be easy to read than the older Start Menu could have allowed for. If you've used Windows Media Center, Office 2010, or an XBox 360, you've already been interacting with similar interfaces. This sort of UI has been slowly making its way into Microsoft's products for a while now.

The Windows 8 desktop looks exactly like it did in Windows 7 and Vista, except there's no Start Button: you're expected to press the Windows key or move your mouse to the bottom corner of the screen to launch the tile dashboard. The desktop has the tray of running programs you're used to in earlier versions, shows you wallpaper, and offers access to the Windows Explorer for looking through the files on your hard drive. All programs can be launched directly off the tile screen, and while Windows 8 apps always run in full-screen, older programs run from within the Desktop and can be resized. We have a version of Internet Explorer accessible from the desktop that looks just like IE 9 did in Windows 7, then we have a version of Internet Explorer in the tile screen that looks entirely different. Some parts of the Control Panel have the tile look and feel and the options cascade left-to-right like the Home screen in any MS Office 2010 or 2013 product. Other parts of the Control Panel look exactly like they did in Windows 7 and before. Unfortunately, I haven't found a good pattern for this yet: you may flip from one side to the other in order to do something like troubleshoot a network problem.

This is really the heart of Windows 8's problems: its identity crisis. It can be jarring to flip back and forth between Modern and Desktop views, but Microsoft can't let completely go of everything that came before without driving people even crazier, so there will be times you're trying to do a thing--like manage users or configure a network connection--and you might be in Modern's full-screen left-to-right only to find yourself dumped into the desktop and shown a dialog box you may remember from earlier versions...and then you need to head back to Modern to take another step. If you're doing everyday computing, like reading documents or checking mail, you don't run across this too often, but the moment you need to take step outside of the ordinary, good luck figuring out which path you should start from, or which you'll end up on.

Performance-wise, Windows had been slowly moving away from always-running programs that drain performance to background services that would launch programs as needed...but this too started to get unwieldy. Microsoft have stripped several services out of Windows 8 which by default makes the OS more efficient than 7. Any machine that could run 7 can also run 8. Programs that used to run, shut down, then have to be fully re-launched to run again are instead put in a standby mode so they can launch faster when called again. The Windows Vista and 7 ""Aero effects"" that gave your windows a glassy sheen and rounded corners used graphics and CPU to run, so they've been stripped out of the tile UI in favor of simple color schemes and blocky edges (though you can still see a subdued glassy effect on the Desktop). Interaction with Windows in this new look and feel is easier if you have a touchscreen or you're using a tablet, and if you're a Windows Phone user the territory is already pretty familiar. The downside for mouse users is that you occasionally spend time hunting along the edges of the screen for scrollbars and dragging screens around to be able to interact with everything. Sometimes you can use the wheel to scroll and sometimes you can't. My chief complaint with Windows 8 hasn't been with the Tile layout so much as the fact that the scroll bars are too skinny.

For some features, time will tell. I've found the Tile UI version of the browser to be less compatible and more cranky with websites, but I expect that to change given time. I like the fact that security/antivirus are rolled into the OS without me having to take care of them or be interrupted with update notifications. The OS runs Windows Updates on a schedule that's far less aggressive than previous versions and won't nag you about rebooting when it needs to. I've been told that the performance for gaming is supposed to be greater simply by virtue of a cleaner codebase, but I haven't seen anything substantially different on the PC apart from faster boot-up and shut-down times (I did benchmark my machine with 3DMark11 and, after some adjusting, noticed a higher score). The basic applications like Weather, Photos, Stocks, Mail, and more are very user-friendly, but solely within the context of the new look & feel: expect little familar ground and a lot of new territory, and the assumption that you should be using a touchscreen. If you have a Windows Live account and/or SkyDrive, these can integrate fully into the OS: so much so that you would sign in to the computer with your Windows Live/Hotmail account and everything you do would be synced to Microsoft's cloud if your account has SkyDrive.

Windows 8 requires you to purchase a license for Windows Media Center separately; you still have Windows Media Player, but the Center is a separate application now, available for sale in the Microsoft Store.

UPDATE, 11/2013: Microsoft has now released Windows 8.1, a minor update to the OS that mostly attempts to make the user experience better. If you purhcase this copy of Windows 8, you will be offered the ability to update it to 8.1 at no additional cost. The upgrade is pushed through the Windows Store that is part of Windows 8. Personally, I've done clean installs of 8.1 from the MSDN media and done an in-place upgrade via the store, on both my desktop and laptop, and have not had good experiences. I don't personally recommend the update at this time for that reason. Perhaps with time it will get better."
"This product arrived a few days ago - I was excited to try it out.  I'm always looking for additional storage and backup options.
I logged in to my Norton account, registered my serial number, was sent to a download link for my (Mac) software.  The link didn't work.  I tried it again several times with no success.
i tried to contact Norton Support for assistance, but gave up after waiting nearly an hour with no response to my chat request (although the support site promises short waits.)
Until two days ago, I'd only ever used one browser, Safari, on my MacBook.  Frustrated by the unresponsive download link, I installed Google Chrome and was finally able to download the software.  Installation was easy, but when I launched the application, it started to scan my hard drive for the suggested files for backup, and six hours later it was still scanning.
So it is now four days since I received the product in the mail, and  I have encountered a non-existent support site, a bad download link, a software application that can't even seem to successfully scan my hard drive to set itself up.  I think I can safely say for the purpose of this review that I do not like the product.  I'll stick with Dropbox, thanks.
Coda:
Today, after much tinkering, I was able to launch the software and start a backup. It was a slow process, but after an hour the backup was complete. If Norton can eliminate the bugs in their setup, this might become a functional product."
"About the only video I'm interested in working with is the video that I get from my cell phone.  I have Motorola RAZR so it isn't some obscure model no one ever heard of.  I was surprised to see that there was no support for the 3g2 file format in Ulead.

I contacted Corel to make sure that they did, in fact, not support this file format.  They don't--at least not yet.  They may support it in the future as patch update (no time line was given)."
"I was interested in SpywareDoctor because of some good reviews about the product that I have read. That is important to me since I am no computer expert. The next thing I look for is ease of use and customer service. If I have a problem I want to be able to reach someone who can help me without charging me extra money.

PC tools website says customer service is open 21 hours a day. I have called a number of times with questions both for customer service and technical support and my calls were answered without a wait. The people I talked to were knowledgeable and I got the answers I needed. I have a competitor's software that I have purchased for a number of years and it takes forever to reach someone and if there is a problem there is a charge to speak to anyone with any real knowledge. So I do like SpywareDoctor. Quality accessible free support makes a real difference.

I did compare what spyware SpywareDoctor found on my computer to a free download I use as well as a competitor's product I purchased and I found SpywareDoctor found more spyware on my computer than the other two programs.

SpywareDoctor is easy to install, has good customer support, gets good reviews and the price is good as well. I recommend it."
"I wanted some quick and easy software to create a legal will for myself (you know, just in case, always a good idea 'they' say), and this software does just that!  In about the space of 45 minutes, I had created a great customized will for myself, including leaving multiple specific bequests: the software is super easy, with templates already installed, and you run through the prompts and answer the questions to produce a will: great product, would definitely recommend!"
"I think I got my first version of PDF create 2.0 with my first Xerox scanner about 10 years ago. It was very useful and handy, it helped create PDF file from anything that can be printed. Since then, I have accumulated almost every version of PDF create, most of them came with one or the other multifunction machine or Paperport. But PDF Creator version 7.0 is the slowest and the most buggy.

PDF Create produces PDF files in 3 ways.

1). PDF create 7.0 installs itself as a printer on your computer. Let us say you want to create a PDF file from a webpage, you will print the webpage on PDF Create printer, give the file a name, and it will create the PDF file. This is the way I use it most of the time.

2). It also installs a program called PDF Create Assistant on your computer and you can add the files that you want to make PDF from, say a Microsoft Word document, click create the icon Start PDF Creation and it will turn the document into a PDF file. It works but I rarely use this way.

3). The third way to create PDF files with this program is from that PDF create toolbar in Microsoft office.  I found that to be very buggy, and it crashes the Microsoft Word. I had to uninstall that toolbar.

Instead of making the program better with the newer version, Nuance has made it even slower and buggier. Here are the problems I encountered with this program.

1). It installs with Visual C++ 2005, even though my computer as all newer versions of Visual C++ including 2008 and 2010. I think all of those were installed by one of the other Nuance program. These guys at Nuance cannot get their act together, each of their programs installs a different version of Visual C++, without even checking if the newer version is already on the computer.

2). Unless you choose custom install, it will install the PDF create toolbar in Microsoft office, which crashes the Microsoft office. I would also not install any add-ons to PDF Create 7.

3). At the end of installation, it asks you to register the program, and then the registration screen freezes. I had to press Ctrl-Alt-Delete to get out of that.

4). It also installs registration reminder and update program on Windows Startup, which really slows down your computer. Run msconfig and uninstall those startup programs.

5). The program is still named ScanSoft PDF Create! The name of the company now is Nuance. It tells you how much attention to detail Nuance pays.

6). Nuance has Draconian activation policies. They allow only one activation for each program. Tough luck if you need to reinstall the program because you changed hard drive or got a new computer.

Since there is no law to force Nuance to eat its own dogfood before feeding it to the customers, the market should punish the sloppy companies. I would not buy this program, I think there are cheaper and faster alternatives available out there. On one of my computers, I use PDF Xchange 4 to create PDF documents, it is much more versatile, cheaper, and faster. I use it in combination with scan to PDF, which converts scanned documents into PDF files. And you can download a free version of PDF Xchange to try."
This AP rocks!!! I miss you 3Com!!!!
what boost?
"Been using this for years. Cheaper to buy this little bulk of 3 than in a single. I use these especially on humid or rainy days as I have hair that will go nuts, frizz & grow as the day goes along on these types of days. Don't use too much though because it will give a greasy look if overdone."
"This is a capable video editor on par with PowerDirector. What sets the Ultimate version apart is that it comes with ""Boris Graffiti"", which is worth the price all by itself."
"This is an excellent alternative for those people out there that do not know how to use FTP commands.  :) A subscription is required for the person sending the file - which can be up to 2GB in size.  The sender uploads the file through their simple interface, and then a link is sent to the recipient - who can securely download the attachments.  The site is protected by 256 bit encryption, and they use their own compression algorithm.  I have been using this to send sound MP3 files to a podcast to which I contribute.  Bear in mind, you will have to renew this subscription each year."
"I was reluctant to move to a new platform after using Office 2003 for so long, but now I am wondering why it took me so long!  Admittedly, you have to do some head scratching from time to time to figure out where things are...how do to what you were used to doing without even thinking in the older version. Doing a copy/paste activity is a good example of this.

So, there is a learning curve to this, which can be daunting.  But, if you're patient and take the time to learn, you will find that the process of editing or making changes eventually becomes much faster (less clicks) than the previous formats.

I really don't mind, even like, the ribbon feature.  You can customize it so it only includes what you use the most often.

Also, other reviews have mentioned this, but be aware that upon installation you should selcted ""customize"" instead of ""upgrade,"" else you will loose certain programs in the previous version (in my case, MS Outlook 2003, which I had to reinstall).

Although I cannot comment on any upgrade benefit from 2007, I consider this a very worthwile upgrade from 2003."
"So perhaps you, like me, have been using Office for almost all of your adult life.  And you know every few years they come out with a new version, and with internet connectivity, they can bug you to upgrade every few weeks.  Well I go the chance to upgrade.  And I did.

Now you either download with a code provided by Amazon, or you buy the PC card, which come with a card that has the code you use to download from Microsoft.  You go to the Office website, enter you code and Microsoft starts the download and install.  Nice thing is it loads the basics first and you can start using Word or Excel almost right away.  But of course this depends on the speed of your computer and internet connection.
But mainly I want to talk about the different versions.  They look exactly the same but there are some issue to be aware of:
Microsoft by default installs the 32-bit version of Office.  This is because the 32-bit version place nicer with both versions, while the 62-bit version has some issues doesnt play as nice with other.  So you have to install the 32-bit option first then install the 64-bit version if that is what you want.

According to Microsoft you will want the 64-bit version if:
You work with extremely large data sets.
You work with extremely large pictures, videos, or animations in PowerPoint.
You work with extremely large Word documents.
Youre working with files over 2GB in Project.
You want to keep the 64-bit version of Office that you're already using.
Youre developing in-house Office solutions.
Your organization requires Hardware Data Execution Prevention (DEP) be enforced for Office applications.

And these suggestions are made because Microsoft warns that the 64-bit version:
Solutions using ActiveX controls library, ComCtl controls won't work. There are many ways for developers to work around this, and provide you with a 64-bit solution.
32-bit third-party ActiveX controls and add-ins won't work. The vendor would need to create 64-bit versions of these controls.
Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) that contain Declare statements won't work in the 64-bit version of Office without being updated.
Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) that contain Declare statements won't work in the 64-bit version of Office without being updated.
In SharePoint, the list view won't be available.

So there really is no reason to install the 64-bit version unless you are already suing it, or you work with some huge files.  Your life will be easier with the 32-bit version.  Any questions feel free to ask."
"Pinnacle Studio 17 Plus is an easy to use program that's great for those who have a bit of experience with video editing software, but users don't have to be an expert to get good results. Its fairly easy to learn and has a lot of great features.  Installation was easy as well, and ran with no difficulties, although it took about 20 minutes to complete.

I was most interested in the Live Screen Capture feature, but it was a bit difficult to find.  Users are required to look for it in Program files and manually make a shortcut in order to access it.  Despite that small flaw, Live Screen Capture works well most of the time.  For instance, it will capture video from MineCraft flawlessly, but I've had issues trying to get it to screen capture some other video games.

All around, Pinnacle Studio 17 Plus does a good job with minimal effort."
"Why you'll love PaintShop Pro:
+ Loads great on Windows 8 (I don't have 10 yet)
+ Single license as long as you want it
+ Skin Smoothing: You'll never look this young in real life
+ Magic Move removes things in the picture you don't want
+ Lots of nice tools: Sharpen, blend, smooth, you name it

Not so great:
- Ugh, learning curve.
- Layers, I'd prefer a single layer, but this is ""PRO"", so OK
- No, I don't have any serious complaints, this is a great tool"
The product arrived in 2 days.  Installation went without a hitch using the Windows 7 easy transfer download from Microsoft.  All my settings and info integrated just fine.  A great buying experience.
Worked fine -easy to install
"Overall this is a similar package to the Paintshop Pro Ultimate but with less included items.  Less costly and so more inviting for those who are on a tight budget.

I've been using IRfanview for a long time to do my basic photo editing.  However, once I stepped up to a DSLR camera, I wanted something much more powerful to do the job.  A long while back I had use photoshop and was quite proficient.  But I remember a very steep learning curve and a software package that was expensive.  This Paintshop program really cleans up photos that I take to a higher level and it's really easy to learn how to do all the functions.  Runs well and does not crash.  Highly recommend it for the price in consideration."
"There is a strange mixture of articles in this magazine.  Some are about outdoor activities- though not really about *you* doing them, but stories about someone else.  Other articles seem completely general interest that would not be of any more interest to an outdoorsy person than anyone else.  There are entertaining travel articles about writers' trips without too much practical information if you were to plan a trip.  However, in the back there is a large section of advertisements from all kinds of outdoor adventure places.  The photography section is lovely; there are a couple of pages of just artistic photos. For an active outdoor magazine, it seems a little too passive."
"I used TaxCut for several years until they dropped Mac a few years back when I switched to TurboTax. With all the negatives about TurboTax's pricing, printing, etc. and the fact that TaxCut had seen their error and come back to Mac I switched for 08. The install was a breeze and it imported data from last year's TurboTax perfectly. Software updates of IRS and state info was also very easy. Help screens, informational videos, etc are all well done. Question format clear and easy to understand. Easy to do taxes following the questions, but it is also easy to jump around, find forms, etc. I used their live chat for one question and the rep responded quickly. Includes extra tools like a calculator. I used the included DeductionPro but since I'd already figured most of that, I really didn't use all its features, but it looks very good. Only one small beef in TaxCut--an itemized list feature doesn't seem to work properly, but there was an easy workaround. I've used it to prepare and efile for several family members and will finish mine as soon as I get the last info from a brokerage, so the 5 free federal efiles are very nice. Just wish the state efiles were free too. My kids decided the $19.95 was too steep and printed/mailed theirs.

I've had training on H&R Block's software they use in their storefronts, on AARP's software used in their Tax-Aide program, and used TurboTax for 3 years. I can honestly say TaxCut is easier, more intuitive, has great help features, and is at the top of the pack. The inclusion of 5 free federal efiles is a real bonus. Now, if we can only get state efiles too, I'd give it a 5 star rating!!

UPDATE: the itemized list feature now works. May have been my error or perhaps it was corrected in the last software update."
"First of all, the real advantages of OSX 10.6 are not additional features (held to a minimum this time) but performance--especially speed and extra gigs of freed-up space.  Read the accompanying description and, without the references to Version 6, you might think you're reading deja vu all over again--all the same prattle you heard about OSX Version 5 --talk about Cover Flow, Expose, colorful panoramic views and three-dimensional perspectives.  And of course the striking photo of the cat with chillblains goes along with the emphasis on the scenic and the exotic, almost reminiscent of Apple's recent promotion of an iTouch as ""the funniest [?] iPod ever""--anything to get your attention and lead you to believe that their computers are all fun and games.  But anyone who's used these machines for an extended period knows that for all the conveniences there are exasperating delays and confounding snarls, frozen machines, uncooperative programs and internet sites, and hours of down time, often sufficient to make you wonder if all the consumer technology of the past twenty-five years has saved us any time whatsoever.

But sentiments like the foregoing may be sufficient to justify purchase of this latest edition, or ""upgrade.""  I couldn't care less about the colorful toys (I never use Cover Flow or mess with a widget)--but it's impossible to ignore the times that you sit for minutes watching the wheel turn without a file opening or a letter being sent.  Those seconds add up, often eating up a day's worth of valuable ""living time,"" time best spent not at a computer screen but out in nature, perhaps trying to catch sight of the real deal (better, I say, catching sight of a feral neighborhood cat in your front yard or, as happened to me the other day, a red fox nonchalantly walking past my house than staring at computer images).  What I've noticed about Version 6 is improved speed.  Internet sites that were formerly loggy, slow and snowbound seem to snap into place with zest and efficiency.  It feels like my iMac has been rejuvenated, been given some Geritol, maybe a testosterone implant.

Now the challenge will be not to load it up with all sorts of buggy software programs (many of which simply haven't caught up with the potentials of the hard-wired gear). I'm beginning to see even Microsoft Word as a cooperative companion for this cat  instead of experiencing the momentary twinge of hesitation preceding use of the slow behemoth.  In fact, thanks to the improved metabolism, it now seems as good a bet as TextEdit for some of those smaller tasks.

I realize that these are highly subjective impressions early in the game, but for twenty-five bucks I don't see how you can NOT make the switch.  It's all about putting that spinning wheel out of its misery and getting your machine to do the work you paid it to do in the first place."
My girlfriend enjoyed it.
"I was disappointed when our kid's first ""National GeographicKids"" magazine finally arrived. This magazine is nothing like the original National Geographic. Honestly, it's one big advertisement with infrequently placed articles and trite kids activities. This could be so much more...

"My youngest son, 39 years old, loves the movies and goes every week.  He should review movies, all his friends contact him, to see if the movies was worth going to.  He was in Houston, which has AMC Theaters, so I bought them for him.  He lives in Richmond , Virginia which does not have AMC.  He goes to DC to use the cards also."
"I have been using TurboTax for years.  The transfer of data from prior years is fast and easy.  I use it when it first comes out each year to do some quick tax calculations to plan my year end transactions.  For planning purposes where one does not have all the various forms from financial institutions, one must force the program to ignore certain missing information, or go back to the paper copies of the various forms received from those institutions in prior years.  These problems, of course, go away when one is doing the actual tax return, since those forms for the current year would be at hand.  This is only a problem when doing early estimates without the various forms.

I like that the program is constantly updated as one approaches the actual filing time, so that everything is current and up to date at the time of filing.

A good solid product that gets better each year.

Be sure to buy the level of Turbo Tax that you need for your own particular situation - since moving up their product line can be expensive."
"I wrote a very unflattering review of this product because, as I found out, the 32-bit version of the product must have had issues with residue from a prior standalone installation of MS Office.  I finally read a review that said something about going back to Office 2013, and thought...if only I could!  Well, you can.  Something that is not highlighted with this release is that there are multiple installation options, including an option to install Office 2013 32-bit or 64-bit, as well as a 64-bit version of 365 (and more), which I ultimately went with (despite warnings it could conflict with 32-bit software).  So far....Eureka!!!  It's working flawlessly.  After you buy the product, you don't have to install the 32-bit, which is the big, attention-getting button.  Look at ""options.""  Choose from among them.  Software itself gets a 4-star review, just because I don't know what conflicts I might run into that force me to go to Office 2013.  The process of getting from point A--can't run ""365"" (manifests as Office 2016 for me because this machine had a ""pro"" version of windows installed on it once upon a time) to getting working email, etc., has been nothing less than grueling because there's no walk-through up front.  That gets a black hole of suckiness.  Overall, a 3-stars.  I'll bump it up if deserved by the software once the hours spent trying to make this whole thing work lose their sting."
"Well, I'd tried all I could to get this to work on W8 or W7, it simply won't install. Couldnt install on W8 beta, nor Win7 but DID get it on a fresh install of XP with SP3. Scan time of 2TB drive, all files 700MB-2GB each, terrible 45 minutes scan time.

Uninstallation? FORGET IT. Took me an hour deleting everything I could find left over in the registry after uninstall.

Same old Norton. I hate it."
Very Cute!
This is a great product. It is alcohol free but holds well . I used to get it at Sally's but they discontinued it . Thankfully I was able to buy it here.
"I use Premiere Pro and After Effects professionally and I state that upfront to make it clear that my expectations of PowerDirector are much lower. I expect something along the lines of Apple's iMovie, and hopefully better.

I installed this on one of my Windows 8.1 computers, an Asus laptop with a 17"" screen, 8gb RAM, and a 1.83gHz Baytrail-M processor. A speed demon this is not, and its lack of a dedicated video card seriously slows down video processing. With that in mind, it's still hard not to get frustrated when PowerDirector lags and freezes, but keeping expectations in check, I find I am more annoyed with odd little bugs that happened frequently. The worst of these bugs was the play head, and accompanying video, jumping to the end of the video timeline while the audio played where it should be. This happened over and over while editing a video, making it impossible to preview effects and transitions.

But onto the good: PowerDirector keeps things pretty simple. Import your video, then click to select and drag the clips you want onto the timeline. Once there, video is easily trimmed simply by dragging from either end of the clip to shorten the video. Place the playhead where you want to cut a video and click ""Split."" The result is two pieces of the same video that can be moved or deleted independently.

I was initially a little thrown off once I'd trimmed my video to the needed lengths: where are all the video and audio editing tools? Turns out they're hidden away, sort of. Select a video and you'll note a banner of buttons appears above the timeline section. Most notable is the Fix/Enhance. Select this and what I was looking for is here - color correction, lighting adjustments, white balance, and stabilization. Each of these gives you deeper control over the image, but, at least on my computer, they can be slow to apply (and un-apply in order to see the difference.) Here is where Premiere shines - each effect has its own on-off switch while PowerDirector only toggles all of the changes made in a given section. It's not the worst thing, but it does make things just a tad more frustrating.

Stabilization is handled quite well, correcting a very wobbly bit of video with very little of the sloshy effect that stabilization can have.

There are transitions galore, from the basic fade to 3D. Select one, drag it down to the point that it needs to be utilized - and this is much more fiddly than I've experienced before. It needs to be placed right at the very beginning or end to snap into place. Anywhere else and you have to go back and reselect it. There is very little forgiveness when it comes to placing transitions in PowerDirector. Zooming in on the timeline using the slider in the lower left of the program may help with this.

Exporting your video is done through the Produce pane, and you are offered a plethora of choices here. Many different formats and settings for each one. This could be overwhelming for a new user. PowerDirector defaulted back to the original file format here, why I don't know - I don't want it back in a format for the camera. Also available here are direct uploads to favorite video hosting sites - YouTube, Vimeo, etc. I simply exported my video as mp4, and a 12-minute video is going to need a bit over 2 hours to render.

I wouldn't choose PowerDirector over Premiere, but at home, for simple video editing, it's a decent enough program. Apple iMovie keeps things simpler, but PowerDirector offers more options, but it's pretty close in approach. Were the choice up to me, I'd probably choose Premiere Elements because not only does it have a familiar interface for me, there is a lot more online user support for Premiere than PowerDirector. Sometimes being able to easily track down help makes all the difference."
They fit perfectly. These shoes are great for walking - so very comfortable. Love them.
"The Step by Step Data Entry gives no warning that you will double entry any Sale of a PTP if you enter the Sale in the 1099-B Brokerage down load of sales and in the Sales area of the K-1 for the PTP; like it seem to be requesting by the way the questions are phrased. But if you switch to the Forms mode while entering the Sale data in the K-1 area; you will find TurboTax Instructions in BOLD LETTERS instructing you to enter ZERO for both the Sale and Basis on the K-1 entry form if the Sale was reported to the IRS by the Broker on a 1099-B. Please put that warning in the STEP BY Step instructions.  You also have to do some other steps as a work-around that can be found in the Community Forum (and even discuss by TT Employees) to make the return perfect

TT Business still needs to be able to import transactions from a Broker for investment sales.  Almost every Trust has investments so why isn't this a feature in this product.

Overall less buggy than last year.  I use both TT Premier for personal taxes and TT Business Form (1041)from two Trusts"
"I changed my Dell Duo from Windows 7 to this in order to gain more knowledge about the system.  I cannot understand why Microsoft made such a move.  Windows 8 is fine, I guess, for people who just like to play around with a computer but there is no comparison with Windows 7 when it comes to serious work.  Also, there are still many business applications that are not compatible with the system.  If you are more interested in graphics, touch screen utilization and have light business use, Windows 8 is probably okay for you.  Certainly, if you change, this method of changing is the way to go.  Software products from Amazon are great!"
"I put this on our 2 androids, my mac and my sony laptop. No problems!"

"Microsoft itself offers a 30 day money back guaranty on this product. Keep all the packaging because you may want to return this product.

  I'm a long-time user of Streets & Trips.

  This release is very disappointing.

  I use the Points Of Interest function often when I travel to find restaurants near my hotel and such. Earlier editions have been very good in this regard: this edition - in one word - stinks.

  I looked up the hotel I stay at in Washington. Not only was the hotel grossly mislocated, but so were many of the restaurants and other points of interest in the area. There is no excuse for this. Streets & Trips would have me lost.

  As a double-checked, I mapped the area around my home. A restaurant that closed two years is still on the map. Another local restaurant is located on the map a full block away from its actual location.

  I haven't tried it for routing yet and probably won't. If it can't locate a restaurant with a known, fixed address correctly, how will it map my route to a destination with a known fixed address accurately?

  This item is going back.

"I am a 20 year user of Quicken.  Generally I have been satisfied with it until this year.  I am a Mac owner and have installed Parallels and Windows just so I could run Quicken.

I even was a beta tester for their Mac product.  I was disturbed when as a tester that Quicken ignored the majority of the other beta testers who were asking them to basically port the Windows version and features to the Mac version.

Now with 2013 they have decided to eliminate a simple way they had been using to enter, track and pay loans.  Instead they have created an obscure, complicated, not user friendly process (Not a simple window with your needed options like ""pay"" and ""when"" and ""make extra payment"" and check balances.)

Other users have complained about this and several have said they will drop the program after many years if Quicken does not change it to the simple process it was before.

I will wait a month and if it is not fixed, I will look for a better finance program."

"I have been subscribing to The Food Network Magazine,(FNM) for almost a year now.  Down through the years I have subscribed to several cooking magazines, and for one reason or another have eventually let them drop.  Every one I know, or have subscribed too were bi monthly magazines that mostly contained some cute little departments in them that were fun to read, but mostly a whole lot of recipes.  True recipe magazines aren't a bad thing if you enjoy just holding something in your hand the old fashioned way, but if its really recipes only your after, the online world is absolutely infested with huge sites where that is all they have and do.  I just never felt I got enough beyond the recipes in the other magazines to ever make them worth keeping...

FNM is a whole different periodical.  Its more like a trade journal of the food network, and culinary industry in general.  All done in a nice easy, fun to read, colorful and entertaining style.  Its like being on the inside of the food channel, back stage where for most of us that love the food network, always wish we could be in any event.  I think its pretty much safe to say if you love the food network, or just love cooking, you will find this magazine immensely entertaining.  Its full of behind the scenes glimpses of the personalities, sets, production, and operation of all the shows we love to watch, as well as interviews, informative information, and a good dose of humor as well.  It also has a nice set up of every month departments where you can ask your questions, get reviews on new books and equipment, and get loads of tips on just about every kind if food or cooking that you can imagine.  Finally, despite what some other reviewers have expressed here as it being short on recipes, FCM still packs a good number of them into every issue, (even more starting about 7 issues ago). They also spread the recipes out as to dispensing them pretty evenly among all the different stars that have shows.  Therefore if you favor a certain personality or show, you will find something from them regularly.  Personally one thing I love about this magazine as to its take on recipes is that they don't seem to concentrate so much of sweets and desserts.  Seems like every magazine and cookbook I have ever owned deems is necessary to have a whole section devoted to just desserts.  I much prefer more in the way of recipes for real food, which FNM does a good job of delivering.  The recipes I have actually gotten around to trying from its pages have all turned out to be delicious, as you might expect.

Lastly there are two others things worth mentioning if your considering subscribing to this FNM, and doing it here on Amazon.  The first is that FNM is published 10 times a year, or 3 more times than all other cooking magazines I know.  I like the fact that it comes every month but two.  (And trust me, this is a slightly over size, thick magazine, not just a thin thumb through).  Finally, I originally subscribed to this magazine through one of those subscription service sites on the web that claims to always have the lowest prices around.  I paid $18 for my subscription, and as of this writing it is still going for that price online, while here on Amazon its currently $15.  A pretty good savings for what it is.  I not only highly recommend this fun entertaining and informative magazine, but I also recommend you buy it right here on Amazon. I certainly will be when my subscription renewal comes around. I am immensely enjoying my Food Network Magazine, and I really think you will like it too..."
works great on windows 10
I like books on my P.C..
"I use this software to edit a small web series. There are few special effects, but it does well with small things (integrating a car chase and animation, in my case). This software is a vital tool for clarifying picture and color on a budget. I run Windows 8 Enterprise on a Lenovo All-In-One, and this runs smoothly without conflicting with other programs or causing issues (which Corel always did to me). If you have simple projects that don't require a whole lot of special effects, this is a good budget program, and I definitely recommend it."
"This review is entirely from the perspective of people looking at Photoshop alternatives, now that Adobe has switched to a monthly fee model with Creative Cloud.

I use to do computer graphics and fine arts more than a decade ago, but I don't work in that field, and so I only actually need to use a high end graphics program every few months or so.  I've used Photoshop for more than 10 years, but now that Adobe has gone to Creative Cloud with a monthly rental but no purchase option, I need an alternative.  I don't do graphics often enough to justify a monthly fee on the Adobe Creative Cloud plan, and I have concerns about whether I will be able to open files years into the future unless I can own the software.  My personal alternative is the Gnu Image Manipulation Program (GIMP), but GIMP has a clunky user interface.  And, I also recommend software for a small university library where students and staff are also looking for something for occasional use.

Corel Painter 2015 has a decent user interface.  I was able to do simple edits quickly and intuitively.  I was also able to use the User Guide to quickly find and follow instructions for applying a mask.  There are a lot of options, because you can do a lot for it, so I think it's better for someone who has used a high-end graphics program before or who wants to be able to do more.  It was easy to find instructions for using the software.  There is a big long PDF User Guide, tutorials on YouTube (this is officially how Corel makes the tutorials available), and by Googling I could find websites where people talked about using the software.  So, you will be able to quickly find instructions on doing common tasks in Corel Painter.  One thing that bothers me is that the user guide is an included PDF, so I will have it as long as I have the Corel Painter CD, but the tutorials are made available as YouTube videos.  I won't necessarily be able to go back to a tutorial a few years from now, since I can't store them with the software.

All in all, this is perfectly adequate software for editing digital images, and has a range that goes all the way up to fine arts.  There is a 30 day free trial to demo the software, and you can get this from Corel's website to try the software out."
I enjoy the fiction in the magazine each month and the recipes and home care suggestions are excellent.  I order this magazine for a daughter inlaw as well.
"Scam as is. Program stop  working and after I reinstalled MC told me they don't support it anymore

"Been a TurboTax fan for close to 18 years, but they broke the bank this year, plus NO LOYALITY to repeat customers. Reviewed H&R and found it offered the same features as TurboTax, but at a more reasonable price. Downloaded the product from Amazon and started my 2014 return. So far it beats TurboTax hands down."
"First off, I suppose I'll have to start by stating that I initially knew very little about the Japanese language, other than little snippets spoken to me from old Godzilla movies and various anime titles. To an outside viewer any foreign language can seem like a perplexing challenge to take on. It usually requires regiments of classes and years of complex study. When Rosetta Stone advertized itself as being able to teach foreign languages in an easy, concise manner, I was very skeptical. Now that I've spent a few months using this software in the small gaps that open up during my busy schedule, my skepticism has completely dissolved.

While I can't claim to have gained mastery of the Japanese language, I can say that I've learned quite a lot by utilizing this outstanding software. The program allows the user to work with a headset, in which you speak various words and sayings into a microphone. Feedback is given on how well you pronouce these words and compared alongside the audio samples of native speakers. The visual techniques employed by the software is also very effective; the mind is immersed in a catalog of recognizable images that methodically builds up a network of associations and helps to gently increase your powers of memory.

While most study involved in Foreign Languages can be ardous and painful, Rosetta Stone somehow manages to turn the ordeal into a pleasent experience. The program is very user-friendly without being overly patronizing, and it ran very smoothly on my system without any sort of technical problems. I was honestly expecting some sort of technical hiccup due to the complex nature of the programming, but one never presented itself.

But perhaps the greatest aspect of Rosetta Stone is it's casual-though-effective structure to teaching. I found that simply using the program for just an hour a day proved to show progress, with most lessons taking 30 minutes or less to complete. It doesn't force its users to dedicate large portions of their life time in order to make progress. The way the lessons are timed and structured, one could come closer to understanding a foreign language while still maintaining a full and busy life with career, friends, and family.

Overall, I found Rosetta Stone to an effective tool in learning Japanese. I've only had the time to get through level 1 of the course, but I'm already inching my way closer to speaking and writing the alphabets of Japanese, without sacrificing any time from my normal schedule. It is highly recommended to everyone."
"I highly recommend Trend Micro Titanium Internet Security 2012.  For most users who don't want to work with advanced features or settings beyond the recommended settings, Trend Micro Titanium has been slightly simplified over the previous Internet Security version from past years. It's fast in scanning, it doesn't slow down my computer while I work, and the way it communicates reports to me is clear and clean.  I love it.  I'm using an AMD Phenom triple-core PC with 8 GB of RAM, and Windows 7 64-bit version. Installation was simple and quick, lasting about 5 minutes.

Even for the advanced users who like to tweak the settings, there are a good number of settings you can tweak.  You can choose if you want security software drivers to load as soon as the computer starts (for Extra Security), only have main drivers load at startup, or have drivers load after the OS has completed loading (for Extra Performance).  You can also set a password to prevent any changes to the Trend Micro software settings.

There are two tools:
Parental Controls and Data Theft Prevention.  Both easy to get to, setup, and turn on/off.

There are four main menus:
Virus & Spyware Controls: containing ""Scan Preferences"" and ""Scheduled Scans""
Internet & Email Controls: containing ""Web Threats"", ""Spam & Emailed Files"", and ""Network""
Exception Lists: containing ""Programs/folders"" and ""Websites""
Other Settings: containing ""System Startup"", ""Proxy Settings"", ""Password"", and ""UI Skinning""

The Web Threats above seems to work with Microsoft Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox. No mention of any other browser. UI Skinning allows you to change the look of the main console.

I've been using Trend Micro for about 4 years now.  I've tried Kaspersky Internet Security, McAfee, Norton 360, and Computer Associates before I started Trend Micro.  I prefer Trend Micro over all of the others because of the speed of installation, the ease of using the software, and the ease of uninstalling, if necessary. For me, it runs quicker than the other internet security/total security packages.  But I don't use Trend Micro exclusively. I like to sample different security packages to see improvements companies make in their products.  Kaspersky works second best for me. I used McAfee recently and that worked quite well, but I still prefer Trend Micro. 5 stars."
"I had tried to learn Japanese several years ago by listening to audio tapes and then by taking a class, and found it very difficult. Rosetta Stone looked like they might have a better answer, so I gave them a try.

First of all, installation was a snap. I installed RS on a Mac running OS X Leopard, and had no problem at all. It takes a long time, though, so be prepared to wait or even walk away from the computer for a while during installation. I decided to try using the Mac's built-in mic instead of the headset provided with the software, and found that it worked well. Of course, this would not be a good idea if there is a lot of noise near your computer. You may have trouble hearing the lessons, and RS would probably not do well judging your pronunciation.

You have a choice of how the Japanese words will display on your screen. If you are primarily interested in learning spoken Japanese, you might choose to have the text display using characters from the English alphabet, as that could help you to more easily recognize and pronounce the phrases.

Japanese is, obviously, very different from English, and I was unsure how well I could follow even the basic lessons. Turns out, it was simple due to the repetition built in to the Rosetta Stone system. The first time I heard a word or phrase it didn't necessarily stick with me, but by the end of the lesson it had sunk in. That has turned out to be key in helping me to learn this unfamiliar language.

Although each phrase is repeated several times, it wasn't boring. The phrases are mixed up a bit each time, and by paying attention and working through the lesson you start to understand a little more each time you use the software.

One thing that makes a difference in how much I retain is working the lessons consistently. Do not expect that you will spend a few minutes once or twice a week and really learn the language. Plan on spending time nearly every day, and the more time you can spare, the better. Half an hour or more a day would be ideal.

Although everyone has a different learning style, I believe that Rosetta Stone can work for many people who are comfortable with independent learning. It is certainly much better than audio-only, and allows you to learn and practice on your own schedule, unlike a class."
"Turbotax is usually seamless, but not so this time.  It has trouble reading online bank accounts and investments, resulting in some rather large numerical errors.  Maybe the upgrades before tax time will resolve the issues; one can only hope.

Addition to this review on 02/19/2013:  I think that the problems encountered above were due to my banks' websites.  I would upgrade Turbotax to a 5*."

"Microsoft Office Professional 2013 is nicely redesigned, fully integrated with cloud, and very touch-screen friendly, but at a substantial cost especially for individual users.  Users of Office 2010 can also access cloud through free third-party services.  So, the major improvement is not cloud access, but the newly incorporated finger gesture recognition now available to every touch-screen equipped device, like tablets, and allowing to scroll, zoom, pan, ribbon-hiding, enlarging and spacing apart icons, etc.  The suite is available as both, a boxed copy, as well as - for the 1st time - on the basis of annual subscription.  Some new features are still buggy (nothing new for Microsoft), but they should be patched, as usually, sooner or later.  Still, the best suite around."
"This software covers almost all media related tasks with a consistent and straightforward interface.  I can think of more powerful versions of most of the tasks, but they each are more expensive and more difficult to learn than this software, and this software produces great results.

For most media tasks, a user just wants a task completed without hassle, for example when burning a CD or converting a video.  For other tasks, such a generating a playlist or editing a digital image, a user will want some balance of options vs ease of use.  I am impressed with the result in basically all cases for this software.  I even caught myself using Roxio instead of GIMP (a powerful imaging program I've used for many years) because I just wanted results quickly.  For a solid 90% of my image tasks relating to photographs (cropping or red eye or minor editing), this would be a quick way to get the job done, but if you're interested in something like photoshop, well, this isn't that.  However, a free program like GIMP can handle advanced tasks despite being user unfriendly for most, which would be an easy supplement for Roxio's general ease and functionality.

The video editor is simple and effective for adding captions or making minor manipulations to improve video quality or silly effects.  The real help is that this program will simplify putting your videos on your many different devices and media sharing services.  This was dead simple and well organized.  If you share a lot of video, this software is worth your consideration.  If you like to make montages or otherwise combine or sort a lot of video, this software is worth your consideration.  It's quite a lot of fun to do with Roxio.

I enjoyed the calendar and greeting card publishing software.  The final product looked professional enough that all you would need to start a business is some good photography and a good printer.

I never ran into any problems with installation or glitches.  Converting video takes time, but it seemed about the same as with handbrake or other normal conversion or ripping software.

In all honesty, this software is probably best for someone who likes modern technology and isn't afraid to use it, but isn't a power user.  For the functionality, it's a good value."
"This seems like a no frills anti-virus solftware. The installation on Windows XP was simple. Not much hassle with any settings. The only dicosmfort is the updates: Kaspersky's site is unbelievably slow, or it appears this way; hence, the it takes forever to complete the updates. Hence 4 stars."
Why get anything else?
"Still the same good product, but some tasks have been made easier and I like the tab functionality better than the old buttons.  A good upgrade!"
"Typical outstanding turbo tax software. Easy to use and basically ""idiot"" proof. Only negative comment is it is a bit pricey, but I have found you get what you pay for when it comes to tax preparation software."

"This is one of those temperamental software packages that you wonder why something that looks so easy can make your life so difficult. I recently had to reformat my hard drive and lost the previous Roxio program I had. Since I quickly needed to copy several DVDs, I had to buy something I could download and get to work on right away. The downloading through Amazon went very well and smoothly (you just have to remember to first download and run the Amazon downloader, then the program itself and install them in that order).

The interface of the program is simple enough, very similar in appearance to the 2010 program I used before, which I found comforting. Except that it freezes constantly, doesn't proceed to the next screen, and just plain refuses to cooperate. In the end, I was never able to use the ""copy""  function at all. The program either stopped dead, or found something to object about regarding either the source or the destination disk, or it failed to recognize one of the drives or disks, or just played dead. I couldn't even close the program, and had to reboot several times.

I ended up having to copy all the DVDs to my computer and then burn the files from the hard drive to the DVD's. Considering that this was a project requiring 6 DVD's, it was no small inconvenience. I am very disappointed."
"I used it to clone a windows 7 disk and it worked flawlessly. Plug new disk into spare internal cable, clone, update bios to boot from cloned disk and it does. Yahoo! The documentation for this feature was good enough for me to succeed on the first attempt."

"NU 16.0 performs basic utility functions, as advertised. However, NU 16.0 must be loaded onto a functioning computer, before utilities can be run.

"In my line of work, it's a great idea to learn another language, and Spanish being the main lingo outside of English in my area, the Instant Immersion program seemed like the ticket.

It may very well be. If it WORKED.

I don't want to stay how many times I put the various DVDs that come with this program in my computer, to bring up a program that did nothing. I looked in the box: no instructions. I went to the developer's website: no useful information. I went to another Immersion-only website: no helpful links.

Now this might be because I have a Macbook, and not a PC. But the program is supposed to be Mac-compatible, so what gives??

I may revise this if and when the developer gets back to me (so far, no replies, and with a program this problematic, that's not a good sign.)

I give this two stars for what it MIGHT be like if I can ever figure out how to make this work, and of course, the bargain price. But it ain't much of a bargain if it doesn't WORK. I'll be glad to revise it if and when.

Meanwhile, Rosetta Stone's looking better and better. Now if it only they'd do something bout the price!"
"I didn't realize when I got this program that it was what it is. However, I have found it useful in a number of ways. Other reviews here go over the product in detail so I won't go into that depth. I will say it was easy to install and get going with it, which is a big big bonus.
I've learned, having been a victim of identity theft, to NEVER keep any info on your computer that you don't want anyone else to use. So... no financial information of any sort is on my computer.
However, I do a number of various research, gather and write papers and this is where I found this program useful. I could put these items into it and feel safe that the information there will be safe.
And so far they have been.
It doesn't hold tons of information, but enough for the average user and that's good for me.
The program is easy to use for anyone who has been using a computer with any sort of protective programs.
I would say that this is definitely worth the purchase and I would again emphasize to never leave financial info on your computer. School papers, research papers and other sort of things that take time to develop, add to, refine.... this is great for those things."
"I'm surprised at how much I like this program.

Having tried quite literally dozens of paint and photo programs since the early 80s, including, of course, Photoshop in half a dozen different iterations, the one drawback I've found with most of them is that they either deliver functionality or they're easy to use.  Corel Painter 2016 is a remarkably functional program with an easy learning curve.  Or at least I've found it so.  Within a few minutes of booting it up for the first time, I produced the quick cat sketch below.  It took me no more than about ten minutes to figure out how to use various brushes to good effect.

Using the Dynamic Speckles and various particle brushes was a little more difficult, but I got a handle on them pretty quickly and produced the landscape below in about half an hour.  Yes, I know both images are rough; they aren't intended to be finished products, just examples of what you can do if you're willing to play a bit and explore the various controls.  Only occasionally did I end up yelling at the program for some non-intuitive method of working that temporarily stumped me.  (Yes, I do yell at programs.  It helps.)  Of course it helps that so much of the functionality adheres to Photoshop standards.  Much of Painter should feel familiar to you.

Look, everyone who uses this is going to have a different response to this program based on their experience with other image programs.  Since this is a chunk of change, I would say go to the Corel website and download the trial version before you lay out any money.  Try Painter Essentials (another program I like) as well as Painter.  Play with them and see how they feel.  It doesn't matter how much functionality a program has if it feels clunky and awkward to you.  If you do like the feel of it, as I do, then I really recommend that you take the financial hit and buy Painter.  Essentials is good, but not nearly as good as the full version.

And have some fun!  That's what this is about.  You're getting this program to help you express yourself.  If it's not fun, why bother doing it?  And if you do use it, why not post a review with some of your work?"
"A gift, for my son's birthday."
"Cyberlink PhotoDirector 6 Ultra is a great program, especially for photo-editing beginners.  If you have already mastered Photoshop programs, you probably won't be abandoning your programs for this one as there are simply not too many complex features that may make you stick around.  I'd say this program is a very complex version of Windows Paint and then some.  If you like Windows Paint and want more additional features without spending too much time on tutorial then this is definitely worth your look.  Want to remove unwanted objects in your pic?  Done!  Want to change hues, tones, brightness, sharpness and have a HD look to your photos?  Sure!  Want to remove wrinkles, fine lines from your face or get a new head completely altogether using a crop tool?  You can do that here!

While there is a disc included in this program, get ready to update to a new version as soon as you install it.  Also, any manuals or tutorials you desire can be acquired online only."

"Avast is a great antivirus program. The problem is that what you download is a trial program. If you like to play hopscotch, you line up a bunch of these trial offers and install a new one whenever the limit expires. I prefer stability"
"Edit: I would like to downgrade this product to two stars. Please read my addendum in the last paragraph below.

I run VMWARE Fusion 2.0 on my latest MacBook Pro (2.8Ghz, 4GB RAM, 512MB Graphics RAM, 7200RPM drive). I run the Mac OS Leopard and the Vista Business edition (SP2) on a BootCamp partition.

This is an excellent virtual machine software that has been expertly programmed. But to run it properly, you need a robust hardware (preferably the latest iMac or Mac Pro) and a LOT of RAM (I would NOT run VMWARE on a machine with fewer than 4GB of RAM). This software is ideal for a hardware with Quad Core processors (most intel chips, including my MacBook Pro, have only a dual core) with 8GB of RAM. The overall performance of this software on my latest MacBook Pro was barely satisfactory and sluggish. Fortunately, the kind of hardware required to run BOTH the Mac OS and Windows CONCURRENTLY with excellent performance will be common (and fairly cheap) in 2-3 years from now. If you must run both OS and run them well, then I recommend you get the best and the latest hardware at your disposal (Quad core + 8GB RAM).

Pros:
1)VMWARE Fusion 2.0 automatically detected my Vista BootCamp partition and there was no additional configuration neccessary. It also gave me the option of transporting the entire Bootcamp into a virtual machine, BUT that would destroy the dual boot (without using VMWARE) capabilities of my MacBook Pro, which I chose not to do. If you are already using BootCamp, the VMWARE Fusion will logically start the BootCamp Windows instance by default. Please note, as long as you do not transport the BootCamp into virtual machine, you can still dual boot your Mac in either OS.

2)I could run the entire Windows Vista as a separte virtual machine (separate OS instance) on OS X Leopard. I can view Vista either in a window or in a full screen size as if I am running only Windows Vista on a Mac.

3)I can choose to view only the active Vista applications running. The Windows applications will look as if the application is running on OS X Leopard. This is one of the coolest feature of VMWARE Fusion. The Vista application still runs on top of Vista so the Vista still must be started (booted) within the VMWARE first.

4)The VMWARE Fusion is very easy to use. But it helps a lot to be computer savy.

Cons:
1)You will need a robust hardware. You simply can't run two hardware hogging OS (yes OS X Leopard is a hardware hog too) simultaneously with a whimpy hardware.

2)Depending on the hardware, you will need to make some minor adjustments. VMWARE Fusion, by default, only allocates 1GB of RAM to Windows, and that is way too little. You should try to allocate 2GB of RAM (assuming you have 4GB) to VMWARE Windows. In my opinion, you should not run VMWARE Fusion, or other competing products, unless you have a minimum of 4GB of RAM.

3)Running two OS simultaneously using VMWARE Fusion may cause your CPU and Memory to operate at or near its maximum capacity. This may cause overheating of your Mac. Futhermore, any application (either in Mac or in Windows) which is a resource hog will be noticeably slowed down and perhaps even be unusable.

Apple (Snow Leopard) and Microsoft (Windows 7) will be releasing far more efficient versions of their OS in the next coming months in 2009. Futhermore, the hardware will also become far more powerful. These two trends will allow users to run BOTH the MAC OS and Windows concurrently, utilizing VMWARE Fusion, with excellent performance in both operating system environments in the coming 2-3 years.

Addendum:

VMWARE has had some very unfortunate and deliberate side effects to my BootCamp Vista partition. It appears most of the troubles are related in VMWARE's deliberate attempt to nullify the utility of BootCamp partition. Unfortunately, the usage of VMWARE has led me to take on the arduous task of reinstalling Windows Vista using Bootcamp for the following reasons:

1)The installation of VMWARE Tools has completely disabled games that use Direct X Windows graphics technology. After you install VMWARE tools, you will no longer be able to play Windows video games when you boot your Mac using Windows. Worst of all, there is no easy way to undo the damage of VMWARE on Vista. I uninstalled all services and programs related to VMWARE on Vista (including VMWARE tools) and that did not resolve the issues.

2)VMWARE has completely disabled Windows Media player capabilities on my Vista. Again, there is no way to undo the damage (I am sure there is a hack but who wants to hack it?).

Now, I would like to recommend against this product. Please use this product ONLY if you do not plan to use Windows for games or as a media player on the BootCamp partition."
"I will definitely NOT buy this product.  I refuse to be RIPPED OFF $10 for EACH AND EVERY time you e-maill or call customer service.

"I've used Turbo Tax for years and this is the first year I will not be filing a Schedule C for Many, Many Years.

Each version is a little different but the past versions have been very helpful.  Hopefully this version will be the same."
"Trend Micro is a well-known name in the computer security business along with Norton and Kaspersky.

Most of these manufacturers have different suites that include more or less components. I could never understand why somebody would buy only the Antivirus version of a program instead of buying the full suite that has Antivirus, Firewall and Parental Control.

This software is one of lowest packages offered by Trend Micro and it does what was designed for. It takes some time to install and when it comes to performance (slowing down the machine) I still prefer Norton. You can feel that this one is installed.

As far as virus detection, it performs OK but all the security software developers have ups and downs. If you read computer magazines, you know that from time to time they do Security Suites comparisons based on the virus detection percentage and usually from test to test different manufacturers win the first place.

I prefer Norton because the performance impact is minimal and provides adequate protection."
"I believe this is the best Pinnacle release yet. I've owned Pinnacle products since at least before 2001 and I believe it has always been the best and easiest to use video editor. Although Pinnacle always appears to have every imaginable feature, several older versions were not entirely stable.  This 64 bit version seems to be very stable and the fastest yet. It is easy to use and quick to process edited video in many formats and resolutions.  Installation time was quick, but there is an important patch (update) you need to download before you get started. I have a fast computer and high speed download, so the overall installation was completed quickly.

There are so many transitions and other options, it is time consuming to even try all of them and even more difficult to remember which ones I liked best. I wish they would create a favorites section so that I can remember the ones I like best the next time I want to process a home video. I have mastered the older versions, but this release will take me some time to learn how to use everything - not that it is difficult, just takes time. Most everything is intuitive.

Most all the video editors appear to have a familiar look and feel these days. Pinnacle was the trendsetter from what I can remember more than a decade ago. I have owned at least a half dozen versions of Pinnacle, probably considerably more. I spent a lot of money on Pinnacle software, so I feel like I'm justified getting this version at no cost via the Amazon Vine program. I've owned Sony, Adobe and other high end video editors, too.  And I still feel most at ease using Pinnacle.  I believe this is my favorite and I'm going to invest some time to learn and use all the appropriate features."
"This software has an almost unlimited range of creative possibilities from advertisements to posters, logos, book illustrations and amped up family photos. One of the features that makes it exceptional is that you can customize your workspace to whatever design platform you were used to before you started using Coreldraw.  I never had the older version so I wouldn't know any of the differences or any changes that they've been from the old to the new. This program is designed for both professionals and everyday design in editing end beginners and pretty much anyone that buys the software will get a lot out of it and will benefit from it. As a photography student, I use it to create stand-out projects for my graphic design and photography classes in tech school. Definitely recommend it."
"No, I don't work for Microsoft and I am not a Microsoft ""Yes man."" I've used their products since the DOS days. And while I do feel that Vista is a little bloated, the operating system is stable and works.

I have Vista installed on three PC's in my home: A Core 2 Duo with three gigs of RAM and Ultimate, Vista Enterprise for work on a Celeron 3.5 GHz and 1 gig of RAM, and Home Basic on a Celeron M 1.8 GHz laptop. All three of them run well, if not a little slower on the Celeron systems. Ultimate is by far the best version.

Vista is both pretty and more intuitive than XP. I like the new directory structure and Aero interface. Organizing your photos is both easier and more pleasing than in XP. I like AERO and glass but it does hog the system resources and you need a decent video card and RAM for it to run smoothly.

I will say that Vista is a little bloated and I hope that Microsoft will work on this MinWin kernel for Windows 7. Also, too many casual users are comfortable with XP and when XP came out, a lot of non-PC users were finally getting one and they simply don't want change.

Vista is far from the dog people make it out to be and I do recommend it if you have a newer machine."

Oooh, shiny.  I also like the seven hours of battery life on one charge.  But it doesn't have a dvd drive.  I considered copying the software to a card and loading it through the card reader.  However, I ultimately ended up putting the CD in a shared/networked DVD drive and added my netbook to the office network.  I was able to install the program easily.  the scan was quick and it didn't seem to be the resources hog I have noticed with AVG and Norton.

I liked the fact that the firewall was very restrictive on installation and had to be adjusted for exceptions-- there's been a lot of problems over the years with software shipping in unsecure mode and users not realizing the need to adjust.

I'll probably add a couple of favorite security programs like Spybot S&D, and I have created a nonadministrative account for surfing the net, but I think this program is well worth having."
Good magazine.  Interesting articles and timely advice that I can use.
This is a great program for burning CDs or DVDs. This program is the best value for the money.
Really cute packaging!
"While Corel Digital Studio 2010 will eventually allow you to do some video editing, DVD authoring, etc. what you end up with is not worth the journey. There is freeware available for each of the tasks that the suit covers that do a better job. The photo suit is useless. Once you manage to get your photos imported you no more functionality then Windows ""Paint"". After 20-yoars of teaching video editing, I thought I had seen it all when it comes to editing software, but this thing takes the cake. It has limited features, poor interface and is very hard to navigate. It will work, but why use something that is hard to use when the finished product is no better then Windows ""Movie Maker"". This suit is not worth the money."
"The two main components of Corel Draw X8 that I will use are the Raw Photo Editor and the vector drawing program.  This product feels like two programs that I used a lot.  One was a vector based application called Arts & Letters that I used a lot many years ago.  The Corel Draw drawing application is very intuitive for me except I had to explore the menu to learn which tool does what. Theres a lot to learn, but the basics don't take too much effort.  There are numerous useful tutorials built into the product plus there are a lot of YouTube tutorials on many different aspects of this application, so if you have the time and patience, you can learn how to do many different things.

I use the vector drawing tool to make draw renovations or add-on projects for my home  cabinets and the likes.  My wife is new to Corel Draw, but she is very interested in learning how to do everything.  It has many options and will take a while to learn, but with some determination, I think most everyone can learn how to use it.  But there is still a lot to learn to master the advanced techniques. This product is in a professional classification in my opinion.

I especially like the fact I can finally edit photos in Raw format.  I have a Canon D5 Mark II that Ive used to take a lot of photos around the world.  I take both Raw photos in CR2 format and JPG photos simultaneously.  Memory is cheap these days. I am especially impressed with how well Corels auto adjust works.  You can do a side by side split images to compare your adjusted image to the original.  Thats quite useful to know if your tweaks made the photo better or worse.  You can grab the image and move it around to different parts of the photo to see the difference in other parts of the photo being adjusted, not just down the middle.

And if you have previous experience with Photoshop, they have the option where the menu placement and structure will somewhat mimic Photoshop so you can reduce the learning curve when acclimating to Corels version.  I like what I see so far and I intend to use Corel as much as I can going forward  especially for Raw format editing.

This product is clearly not inexpensive.  It is a fairly serious investment to make and you should be sure this is what you expect. Corel offers a free 30 day trial download and no credit card required.  So if you new to this or have never used Corel Draw Graphic Suite, I strongly suggest you take them up on the 30 day trial before spending this much money.  And make sure you download it when you have sufficient time to devote to learning how it operates.  There is a significant learning curve, especially for newcomers.  I have used comparable products and I think I even purchased some of the Corel products quite a while back.  Using it seems all too familiar somehow.  Anyway Im very glad to own this product and I will make good use of it. There are other components to Corel Draw X8, but I doubt that Ill use everything in this package.  I think my wife might make full use of it. Shes excited to use it.

I did receive this product on Amazons Vine program, but just for the record, I have to pay self employment taxes (double social security tax) on what I receive and income tax as well.  So that works out to be about 36% incremental tax for me. Amazon reports this as income to the IRS. In the beginning it appears to be free, but when I pay the IRS, it is definitely not anyway near free. I write Vine reviews the same as if I bought it directly and give out the full range of stars from 1 to 5. You can check my 800+ reviews for proof. If a product performs as advertised, then I give it 5 stars. I would never knowingly mislead anyone with my reviews."
"I purchased this software a year ago. Find it very easy to use. I probably ask more of it than the average person would,and it delivers. I used it on 20 old B&W family photos taken back in the 30's and 40's. Was able to scan, repair, and print some wonderful enlargements. On one of the snap shots of my older brother and sister taken in 1943. After enlarging you could clearly read the date on the license plate on the car behind them. Was even able to repair what looked like a coffee stain on one of the photos of my mother with the cloning tool. When you email tech support with a question they get back to you. No matter how many questions you ask they respond until your satisfied. No it is not as powerful as Adobe Photo Shop. But it's not $... either. I have been able to do everything so far that I have wanted to do with this software. I would say I'm a serious photo junkie. And shoot 35mm as well as digital photos weekly. I can't wait to try their new Photo Album 4. I purchased the boxed version of Paint Shop Pro because I like having a manual to read away from computer when learning new tricks that I would not have thought of myself. Their web site is also great for picking up great ideas from other users."
"This is a magazine that is colorful and filled with visual eye candy. I love spilling through the pictures (advertisements and all)
I gift many subscriptions, I read, and I subscribe to many magazines as a way to stay connected to trends.
This is a modern and youthful style that blends old and new and has done a great job of staying true to vibrancy of youth and ageless design. Every month they have a ""whats hot"" section that gives trend information, and a truth in decoration section that highlights ONE piece of furniture like lamps, ottoman, shelves and goes deep on the subject. Surprisingly I have also cut out a few recipes from this magazine as well-a little foodie surprise.
This is a great gift for women under 30 living on their own and wanting to dress their nest, clothing design friends, friends that like inspiration and decor, people that office at home, and people who have more that one home. It is light and effortless to gloss through and so it will not pile up as "" I will get to that later"" drivel on the mail pile."
"Quirky, Some files open fine others don't. I would not buy this again."
"As a long time Photoshop User I had some struggles early with the features that are available to you and where to locate them. The program was driving me crazy.  Now after two months of using it, I believe Corel has done a good job with this program. Yes it does not compare to Photoshop but that is like comparing apples to oranges. Paintshop Pro really competes with photoshop elements and as a user of that product also, I will admit Paintshop Pro is better.

The install process does a take a while but so most applications in this field.  The first thing I did after installation was run an update.. I highly recommend this when using Corel's prodcuts.  I have some bad experiences a few of there other programs.

The interface is nice but is not real user friendly, so it does require extra time to learn what features are availble to you.  Corel has gone down the same path as other and uses a black interface.

Using the product
One the first thing the app wants to do is scan your computer images. I pointed towards my folder stucture that I use with lightroom. The organizer is easy to use and has a good feel to it.

When it came to editing photos this is where I struggled at first.  Photoshop Elememts is defintely easier but does not have as many edit capabilites. Corel did include some one step fix features but I believe they did not work well enough for me, I wanted more control. When I ran the one step photo fix I felt the photo became to overexposed and needed tweeking.

With HDR Imagery being the rage lately, Corel included it in X3.  It does not produce the result I like from HDR and does not give enough control like Photomatix.  I am going knock Corel for this because I was suprised to see it even included.

Performacnce wise I did not experienceany real slowness but I am running Intel I Core.  If you have any older computer you may experience slowness, I base this off pf past experiences with the Corel software.

I would definitely recommend this to friends and family with understanding there may be some frustration in the beginning because it is not as easy as Photoshop Elements to use.

4 Stars"
"That is a direct quote from the FTM knowledge base AnswerID 1403.

Even more frustrating, printing 8.5 inch x 10 foot charts did work well using my desktop Epson Photo R800 printer with FTM 2011, but ceased working when I upgraded to FTM 2012. In FTM 2011, Page Setup in the Chart Options box correctly read the user defined page size settings entered via Windows and the usual Epson interface. FTM 2012 ignores those settings and defaults to 8-1/2 x 11 even when roll is specified as the printer source.

So I'm uninstalling FTM 2012 and going back to FTM 2011.

By the way, I upgraded mainly to get the new Print Box on chart feature. Let's just say its capabilities are modest compared to similar features in other software. You can specify font, outline box, etc. only once, so there can be no variety in text added to a chart.

And FTM 2012 is definitely slower than FTM 2011 as many have noted."
Received in good condition.
"First of all, I must say that there is a generous amount of learning Spanish materials included with this software. There are3 40 core lessons that are named after situations that learners of the Spanish language are likely to encounter.  For example:

* Checking In
* in the hotel room
* making a long distance call
* at a restaurant
* asking for directions
* finding an address
* Introductions
* at a party
* making an appointment
* at the pharmacy
* at the doctor's office
* at the laundry
* at the gas station
* at the beauty parlor

All 40 of the lessons include the following sections: Vocabulary sections, Vocabulary exercises, Dialogs, Dialogs Exercises, Grammar, Grammar Exercises, and Interactive Conversation.

The software also features ""workshops"" where the student will have the chance to practice in five areas:
Grammar, Pronunciation, Vocabulary, Conversation, and Simulations

The software also has lots of games to help break the monotony of studying Spanish. I have not had a chance to play the games but they seem to consist of crossword puzzles and online games.

This software also includes a ""progress"" section so that you can measure how well you are learning how to speak Spanish.  But one of my favorite sections of the software was the ""tools"" section which allowed me to customize my lessons.  It even allowed me to set my ""minimum achievement level"" which I left at the default (70%). In this section, I was also able to select the lessons based on which was the most important to me to learn. Such as:

1. The Complete Program
2. Everyday Life
3. Business Spanish
4. Travel
5. Going Out
6. Shopping
7. Complete Customization

There was also a very detailed ""help"" section in the software. But I found the software so intuitive that I never had to use it.

My favorite section of the software was the ""media section"" that included short cultural videos and MP3  audio. The videos covered topics such as Mexican Traditions, Advise for Tourists, the National Museum and more. I highly recommend the Learn to Speak Spanish Deluxe  for any beginner student of the language or for anyone who needs to learn basic Spanish for an upcoming trip to a Spanish speaking country. However, if you are an intermediate student, you will not find this software enough of a challenge.

The three things that I like most about this software is 1), its economic price 2), the enormous amount of learning Spanish material included for the price, and 3) the interactivity of the software.

Some other products that I recommend for Spanish language learners are Rosetta Stone Spanish.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rosetta-Stone-Spanish-Latin-America-Level-1-2-3-4-5-Set-with-Audio-Companion/dp/B00282UXC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rosetta Stone  Spanish (Latin America) Level 1,2,3,4 & 5 Set with Audio Companion</a>&nbsp;is pretty good if you are a visual learner like me. My only complaints are that in  Rosetta Stone Spanish the Spanish is rather basic and the course is excessively expensive.

In order to speak Spanish fluently, you must also learn lots of new words. For increasing Spanish vocabulary, I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quick-Study-Spanish-Vocabulary-Flash-Cards-1000-cards/dp/1423203615/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quick Study-Spanish Vocabulary Flash Cards-1000 cards</a>&nbsp;You get 1,000 of these cards at an excellent price.

To speak Spanish fluently besides having a stand alone course as your base and a method to learn new Spanish words, you will also need to master conjugating Spanish verbs. The best product for that is the
 the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verbarrator-Version-1-1-Windows-Version/dp/B002EADP1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verbarrator Version 1.1 (Windows Version)</a>&nbsp;software. The Verbarrator software does a great job of replacing the boring Spanish verb conjugation books and makes learning Spanish verbs enough fun that you will want to use the software every day. And the more you use the tool the quicker that you will learn how to conjugate Spanish verbs and reach fluency. The Verbarrator is probably the best investment that I have made in my journey to learn Spanish because it is a product that I will use daily until I reach fluency. Unlike some learning-Spanish products such as books that you will only read one time or some Spanish courses that you will at the most review 2 or 3 times from start to finish.

The last product that I recommend for anyone who is really serious about learning Spanish is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ultimate-Spanish-Review-and-Practice-w-CD-ROM-UItimate-Review-Reference-Series/dp/0071492151/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice w/CD-ROM (UItimate Review & Reference Series)</a>. This Spanish grammar book covers every aspect of Spanish grammar imaginable. To get the equivalent learning-Spanish value of this one book you would have to buy 3 or 4 books in the Practice Makes Perfect series."
I have been using online backup services for years and have become accustomed to how easy to use most have become.  The real benefit of online services is that they allow me to chose which folders and which devices I want to backup and then automatically take care of the rest.  The Norton Online Backup seemed like a similar proposition but unfortunately it was not.  It only allowed me to backup from my computer.  Once this was set I could not access my files from other devices (such as a tablet or phone) as easily as some of the other backup systems (such as Dropbox) let me do.  For the price of this product I can buy a Pogoplug device and use a USB storage device to do my own network storage without the headaches (and fears) that this Norton Online Backup creates
"It's TurboTax. The only tax software I would recommend. It is easy to use, step-by-step guide, with built-in check and balances. Even my mom can use this."
very good protection
"Red robin has good burgers, fries could be better they're too thick and if they get cold they're hard to swallow. Overall it's pretty good though"
"You cannot avoid the need for internet security software nowadays.  All affect your system to some degree (slowing).  Some much more so than others.  I feel Norton is the least obtrusive of the widely available products, while affording a good level of security.  Updates are frequent and occur in the background.

This program was downloaded from the Norton website.  This product provides 10 one year licenses for the product.  The one year starts as soon as the first install occurs.  Your password and installation record are all maintained online at Norton.com.  Very convenient.

The software downloaded and installed in a few minutes.  Then it updated itself.  I then ran a full system scan which took about 20 minutes.  It picked up a bunch of tracking cookies, then automatically deleted them  There was no interference with any of the other software on the computer.  (There had been with previous Norton products, but in recent years these conflicts have not been an issue for me.)This Norton product definitely provides some sense of security.  There are a lot of bad dudes out there in cyber land.  This Norton product will not obviate the need for due diligence, but it does impose a solid layer of security between you and those who seek to do you harm."
Good...!!!
"I am a rapid fire touch typist and until recently I had no interest in voice-recognition software, because I type very well. However I was recently injured in a fall, and my left wrist is in a splint and I simply cannot type. This forced me, as a professional attorney with lots of writing to do, to investigate this Dragon voice recognition software. I have now been using it for about a week, and I can truly say that my life will never be the same.

This software works amazingly well. Firstly, let me say that I had no difficulty at all installing the software. I installed it on both my work and home computers and both times it installed effortlessly with no issues. Some of the other reviews stated that Dragon is difficult to install. I did not find this to be the case.

In terms of performance, I find Dragon to be little short of amazing. There is a bit of a learning curve. Firstly, Dragon likes it if you speak the entire sentence at one time. It clearly derives which spelling of the word to use by the context of your sentence and if you break your sentence up into phrases you will get a somewhat higher error rate than if you speak the entire sentence at a time. I have now trained myself to do this and the performance of Dragon when used in this fashion is pretty spectacular.

I am now exploring Dragon's learn function and it appears to work very well. In the legal business we use a number of somewhat odd words which at first Dragon had problems with. However using Dragon's learn features I have managed to add many of these words to Dragon's vocabulary with the result that Dragon handles these odd legal terms very well.

I will update this review after I've been using Dragon for a longer period of time. However, right now, I can truly report that Dragon has saved the day terms of my productivity at work. I simply cannot get by without being able to type things myself. The days in business when executives and lawyers had a secretary to take dictation are long gone for most of us. It is simply too expensive. Dragon handles this function beautifully and I cannot overstate how pleased I am with the program. At the price that it costs here on Amazon Dragon is a howling bargain and I am delighted that I have discovered it. Highly recommended without reservation. RJB."
I have two win 7 and one win 8.1 machine that I don't have to worry about catching a bug.  Also have a MAC that never fails but at least now my Win machines are secure.
"I had an old version of Instant Immersion that didn't work with Vista, so I was excited when this came out.  However, it doesn't seem to have the puzzles and games in Spanish that I liked so much before.  I also didn't realize that it is mostly audio CD's and only one DVD-ROM of lessons.  Not real impressed with the format so I haven't used it too much yet.  I'm sure it will help me more than NO lessons, but it really isn't ""fun"" to learn.  Just watch people recite phrases, then take a quiz.  Yawn."
"This program works basically the same way as the older versions. The graphics and sound have been redone.  However this version is missing some good features that the others had, such as the Media Center. It still is a good value for the price."
Convenient
Love these shoes. My feet feel so much better. Lots of padding and light enough to run in.
"I am not a full-time draftsman, far from it. What I've always wanted was perfect AutoCAD compatibility for occasional use, without paying for the full version of AutoCAD that I don't need.

AutoCAD LT 2010 finally fills this requirement, and does it very well. I was able to open and edit AutoCAD 2010 files with no issues at all. Whether I was reviewing someone else's drawings, or creating drawings of my own from scratch, this package delivers nicely.

Previous versions of LT have choked on some advanced AutoCAD features, and invariably the drawings I have to review include those features. Other times, I really need an AutoCAD feature that just isn't included in the LT version. LT 2010 includes everything I can think of, including things like opening and editing in-place of external reference .dwg files, support for publishing to plotters, object alignment, and a lot of the block reference features.

It has almost everything...except it doesn't have any of AutoCAD 2010 3D modelling and rending capabilities, and it won't even print AutoCAD 3D images. This last one rankles a bit, because I inevitably have to call the client back and ask them to convert to a format I can handle, or print it themselves. I understand that AutoDesk has to reserve something for the premium product. But if AutoCAD LT 2010 just handled 3D printing, I'd give it 5 stars.

Four stars for near perfection, with great AutoCAD file compatibility (except 3D)."

Very comfortable sneakers and I also like the way it fits.
"Past experience with TurboTax was wonderful,
this time, not so.  The program would not let
me download updates, or my state returns.
Or would it let me print my returns. After
spending an entire day, I finally got my
taxes done.  I would have been better off
doing them by hand. An online search told
me that many others also experienced the same."
"This is a really great program. The best feature is the chromecast/Roku streaming. I had much more issues with chrome browser-based casting than this casting service, plus I can use Roku by itself if I want and leave the buggy chromecast out of it altogether. The software also provides the ability to play DVDs and Blu-rays in my disc drive, which is surprisingly not an included feature with my computer. There are other features as well but those are the only ones I tried. The only complaint I have is the price; it does seem a little pricey. Overall, great software."
"I was new to Vista when I received my new laptop, so I wasn't aware of the changing software landscape that seems to be a hallmark of Microsoft products.  Although I did get the Microsoft Office Suite, it now excludes Outlook.  This made me very, very angry.

When the opportunity to review this latest incarnation of Outlook came along, I jumped at it, because life post-Outlook is pretty awful. And, now that I'm back in the warm bosom of Microsoft's email program, I can breathe a sigh of relief.

This is the same Outlook you either love or hate.  The programs still seem to be developed independently of each other. There's also junk email scanning which is semi-useful if you don't have spam blocking on your server side. The Reading Pane is omnipresent but removable and there's this irritating tendency to group messages into, well, groups, as if the entire world thought that would be a good idea for message sorting.  News flash: It isn't. Fortunately, it can be turned off.

The calendar is the same as other Outlook calendars, only a little more graphically appealing.  You still cannot easily import data from one of the Outlook programs to the other; dragging and dropping emails preserves body and header.  Similarly, you can drag an email to your contacts, but that only drops the email name into the contacts list and dumps the entire body into Notes field.  In other words, there's no smart way to navigate content between the various sub-programs within Outlook.  This is something that's sorely needed.  The electronic signature at the bottom of emails is becoming the de facto business card, and it'd be nice if we could just import that content right into Contacts.  But alas, Outlook's not about to be THAT innovative.

The other new thing that hangs around, waiting for you to notice it, is the To-Do Bar.  As if navigating the myriad of Outlook programs who don't really like each other wasn't difficult enough, you are now expected to navigate sideways.  From a space perspective, this makes sense; there's more real estate on the horizontal axis of most monitors.  But it is counterintuitive to the rest of the Outlook design, which is top to bottom. The To-Do Bar is basically what used to happen when you clicked on your name in older versions of Outlook: it summarizes all your relevant information in one place. The problem is that it won't go away easily. It eventually goes away if you can figure out how to ask it nicely.  But apparently each application is treated like its own entity, so removing the To-Do Bar from say, email, means it still shows up when you're in Tasks.

Finally there's what's new in this version of Outlook, the Business Contact Manager.  It requires SQL server. This is most useful if you're running a business, and contains everything from projects to accounts, billable hours to marketing campaigns.  It's of particular use to freelancers and hourly consultants; as a consultant myself once, I ended up using the journal to clock my progress, but the BCM can do it better.  Being the new kid on the block, BCM is better integrated with all the other programs.

At times, Outlook's various programs seem like squabbling in-laws at a wedding...related and not happy about it.  If you can look past that - and if you're a seasoned Outlook user, chances are you're used to it - then this is definitely worth the investment."
"easy to use/install - amazon library helpful.

"After using VMware Fusion for a few months it has become a regular tool in my web development tasks. A few of the reasons I enjoy working with Fusion is:

1. Unity (ability to use windowed apps within OS X)
2. Ability to test in IE, Safari (for Windows), Firefox (for Windows) and Chrome (for Windows)
3. Can freeze VM to skip the long loading process of Windows.

Though with everything in computers there are some trade-offs. I found the following to be limitations but not showstoppers

1. Requires a good chunk of storage space for VM
2. Consumes more RAM than Plesk Parallels
3. The Fusion UI is meant to look like Lion but adds to performance decline

Overall even with the limitations I think using VMare Fusion to run Windows is a great option considering the alternative would be to have a complete Windows machine on my desk.

Note: I have not been able to test on Mountain Lion yet, though I did read some of the other reviewers facing difficulties. So I would either wait or contact VMWare for additional support."
"NOTE:I am posting this review on both product pages for this game since Amazon has the same game listed as two different products.

After getting stuck on this game for a while, I had put it away to try later. After I tried it again and managed to finish it, this game quickly became one of my favorite Nancy Drew games. ""Stay Tuned for Danger"" may be one of the older games in the Nancy Drew adventure game series, but it is also one of the best.

Story-A soap opera star has called you to New York to figure out who is sending death threats to her co star. It soon becomes evident that someone is out to hurt or kill him as the threats elevate and some near fatal accidents occur. It is up to you to figure out who is causing it all.

Graphics-Although the graphics are much better than the first game, they still aren't perfect. They are in 3D, and the 3D is done pretty well. The characters are also pretty good, but they tend to freeze in awkward positions as they are done talking, only resuming movement when they start to talk again. But, overall, the graphics are pretty good.

Sound-The music in the game is OK, but it really doesn't stand out as being catchy. The background sounds are good in the game, and the voice acting is good, too. Some of the voice actors sound like they were really into their parts while some sounded like they were bored.

Gameplay-This game, like all games in the Nancy Drew adventure series, is a first-person point-and-click game. You will move around between 3 main locations while solving puzzles, questioning suspects, and finding clues. The puzzles in this game are very innovative and may require some serious thought to solve them, but although they are a challenge, they are still really fun. In addition to talking to about 6 people in the game, you can also call your friends on the phone to talk over the case from them. You can also ask them for help which is a way to get hints for what to do next.

Length-It's a pretty good-sized game. There's a lot to do throughout the game, and it's not necessarily very obvious what to do next. The game should probably last several hours at least.

All in all, this is probably one of the most challenging and fun games in the Nancy Drew series. It lasts a while, and it incorporates great adventure gaming elements into the gameplay. I highly recommend it to fans of the Nancy Drew series and adventure gamers everywhere!"
I had to return the first pair and buy a 1/2 size smaller.  First time I've had to buy smaller for Nike.
Person loved the design. Like to order my Amazon gift cards so I can choose from the different varieties compared to buying in stores.
"CorelDRAW Graphics Suite has always delivered a fairly consistent product, but this year they've outdone themselves. X7 delivers everything you could ever want and then some - a great alternative to Illustrator. If you've never used previous versions of Graphics Suite you'll probably have a learning curve, but stick with it and in no time you'll get it down. Great product!"
I thought this to be very inexpensive for all that we got.  Great for the you boys for their computer center in our home school.
I have been using this program for years and have been happy with it.  My taxes are not that complicated but I can see that it handles pretty much anything necessary to do taxes.  Will continue to buy especially with great price at Amazon if you keep watching.
"Before installing this anti-viruse my computer was runnning fine, it was really fast and performed excellent. Unfortunately I ran accross this Norton 360 and all changed.
My system, overall, is significantly slower, especially when Norton is updating. The protection is fine but it does slow down my machine. I switched to Kasperski and that problem was solved completely, no more performance issues."
"It took a while to install this-- 30+ minutes with 2 DVDs. I can't award this 5 stars to an ""ultimate"" product that charges you extra for bu-ray authoring. This should have been included with the product, especially at the price point. Still, this product is a great value, especially if you're not a professional and need a lot of pre-made things for your projects. If you want to get professional, everything is there to do it. (Except blu-ray authoring.) You can have a lot of fun with this or make it serious business. If you've had Corel products before, you won't have problems getting started. If you're a newcomer, definitely do the tutorials to get familiar with it. There is enough here that I would upgrade from previous versions and choose this over the regular version without the extras."
I bought several of these cards for 'stocking gifts' for the church staff. Glad that Amazon actually had a Real Christmas themed card.

great gift for the sports lover
"We've used TurboTax for our taxes for at least a decade. It has every software bell and whistle imaginable and many I would never have thought to ask for. This software has saved us untold thousands in tax-preparation fees over the years. It can be purchased as an instant download, but my husband always likes to get it as a disc which can be re-loaded on the computer in the future if a need for it ever comes up, such as (which sadly is all too common) the computer it was originally on crashes and burns and has been replaced."

"I've used Norton Security products for years with minimum problems.  I think it's overpriced and I started using Microsoft's free Security Essentials for our laptops because we don't use them as much.  I think that this version of Norton Security doesn't bog down our two desktop computer's system as much, but it still has some annoying bugs that keep cropping up across versions.  It offers more features than Microsoft's free security software that I find helpful, like the identity safe--otherwise I think it's a bit complicated.  The interface isn't straight forward if you're typing to do som things on your own.  It is, however, a set it and forget it type of program and it will scan your system for viruses when idyll automatically.  Sometimes you manually will have to download updates as the updater sometimes doesn't do it automatically.  Most of the time you can just install it and let it do it's thing without bothering with it.

All in all it's a good product with a hefty price tag offering more than freeware."
I have used Norton internet security for years and have been satisfied. I have had no problems with viruses.
"Norton is going down the tubs, harder to use and GUI is not intuitive.  This product was better before."
Great read
"I'm not new to PaintShop Pro; in fact, I've been using it since version 3 when it was JASC Software's shareware. And yes I purchased all 12 versions in between.  The last 7 versions have become increasingly buggy (since Corel bought the program) to the point where 4 times out of 5 X6 won't even open in Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 let alone allow me to edit an image.  I would love to rave about the keyboard shortcuts and customize interface, but it just keeps crashing.  I've spent the last week trying to find work around after work around to fix the issues and have finally given up.  I did manage to get it to stop chasing EVERY time it opened by turning off some ""features"".  It's still really slow; taking more than a minute to open on a system where Lightroom opens in about 15 seconds. Note; I have no problem with any other graphic intense programs including Lightroom, PhotoShop and GIMP.  If your looking for something cheaper than Adobe PhotoShop, I'd suggest PhotoShop Elements rather than X6 unless you don't mind being more than occationally frustrated."
"I just installed the 2016 version, Total Protection, and like the prior versions that I've used, this is working fine on Windows 7 64bit Pro, on Windows 8.1, and on Windows 10.

I'm using the AV, AntiSpam with Outlook 2007, and Outlook 2010, and Outlook 2013 and I like the wipe functions, the web adviser is ok, the vulnerability monitor is ok - especially for things that need to be updated from time to time but the aren't integrated with Windows Update (Vulnerability Monitor is an agent that runs in the background and tells you when things need to be updated, like Skype, Adobe, etc).  I like McAfee's wipe function that will completely destroy a file that has personal info on it, like a financial spreadsheet, or a USB file that might have personal info on it.  I don't like McAfee's ""safe search"" - another search tool for your browser, and while it sounds nice Google's got safe Search if you want that, and nothing is a good as Google or Bing.  I don't think Total Protection is an overly intensive resource hog on your machine, like Norton's products sometimes have been, but it does use resources - and there are a number of background processes running all the time, so it's going to have a little impact on your machine's performance if you really measure it, but I don't notice it when I just use the PC for normal things."
"Pretty powerful editing software that is relatively easy for someone new to video editing to use. To start using the video editing, the user will be prompted 3 modes of editing i.e. Full Editor, Easy Editor and Slideshow Center. I would recommend that for those who are new to editing to use Easy and Slideshow Center.

This video editor allows the user to render the video in 7 different formats:

1) AVI
2) MPEG-2
3) MPEG-4
4) AVC
5) MOV
6) MKV
7) WMV

of which it supports both Macs and Windows i.e. MOV for Mac etc

Within the 7 different formats, the user can also choose the quality of videos up to 4K videos. For rendering speed, Cyberlink Powe Director is quite fast and experienced video editors will be pleased. An icing to the cake - this software allows batch rendering. Woohoo!!

Not only that, PowerDirector has pre-loaded animation templates which the user can simply type text into the animation for a professional look.

All the features that make video-editing fast and fun is in this small package! Nice! =)
Happy Editing All!"
"Cosmetically, this version is not radically different from Outlook 2003 (which I upgraded from).  The big different is the inclusion of Business Contact Manager - which for my needs proved to be a more than adequate contact manager - with a great level of detail.

SQL 2005 Express is installed in the background as the database engine for BCM.  Be advised that you will have to setup a maintenance schedule within SQL 2005 Express to dump the DB, etc.

The feature added to Outlook 2007 that I really like is the addition of RSS feeds.

Unlike one other reviewer, I had no problem with my 'down-level' office products installed on my PC.  Office 2003 applications peacefully co-existed with Outlook 2007."
"Trend Micro is a company I have trusted for years to do my free online scanning and get virus information when I was without software yet I have never actually had a product of theirs until recently. I normally went with Mcafee or Norton. When I recieved the product I was pretty interested in trying it. I was fairly impressed with the virus protection yet the firewall, on the otherhand, caused a few problems for me when I would play internet based games through Steam. Normally I would use Sygate's Internet Firewall instead of the bundled firewall as I feel their software is much easier to control and offers features needed for a more advanced user. The problem I'd been having is that even will the Firewall disabled my connection in games online was constantly dropping. For no reason what so ever it just started out of the blue. At first things were fine but for no reason after about two weeks of use the software started giving me trouble. Even with the software completely turned off, whatever processes were running in memory still caused problems. The only way I could alleviate the issue was by removing the software. Upon the uninstall the problems ceased. Now I'm not going to say 100% that Trend Micro is what caused the connection troubles but it sure seems like it was more than coincidence that my problems stopped upon uninstall. Whether it was a scheduled recent update they had done that caused the issue or just a temporary bug in the software it was rather annoying. Still I am pleased as stated before with the virus portion of the software. It detects and finds mostly everything every other antivirus software out there will find and doesn't use much processing power to do so. It also is not difficult to navigate in the least. I would recommend getting just the anti-virus portion and leave the firewall stuff up to another company that has more experience in that area. My suggestion is buy the product from the people that specialize in it. Get your antivirus software from the people who specialize in antivirus software, get your firewall from the people who specialize in firewalls, and get your spyware software from the people who specialize in spyware. Simple as that."
"I've installed on four computers so far; everything went well on three of them. The fourth had a third-party Firewire 400 card, which made installation impossible. The system would reboot halfway into the upgrade, spitting out the DVD. Nothing would break, but the installation failed without producing any kind of error message. The only solution, ultimately, was to remove the card, run the upgrade, and then re-insert the card.

That done, the software seems to work. My printer (an old Xerox Phaser) is supported, as are my scanners. The driver for one of the scanners crashes when trying to save to a particular format, but the manufacturer has promised a fix and it's anyway easy to work around for now.

I'd call this 4.5 stars if that were an option."
Great Magazine for women of any age. Lots of interesting information-good variety and great price for a whole year!! It was a gift.
"I have the misfortune of owning a laptop that shipped with Windows 8.1.  It isn't as bad as you've probably heard, it's much worse.  The user interface is completely different and much more confusing.  Installing a third party program, Classic Shell, helps get that back to ""normal"".  However it is unstable, buggy, and prone to getting stuck in loops where if it locks up it reboots itself... again and again.  I got stuck in this loop after a driver update but apparently this loop issue has existed since Windows 8 with no fix in sight.  Microsoft managed to mess this up even worse than Vista or ME.  I think I'm finally to the point where I wish I'd bought an Apple.  Avoid Windows, they just can't get it right."
"Have been using Power DVD since version 3.0. It just keeps improving. It is now Blu-ray and 3D compatible. It a bit expensive if you have to buy it but it comes packaged with many external drives. If you are adding a Blu-ray/3D drive to your system try to get one that ships with the software. If not, recommended for purchase."
"I just installed McAfee Internet security on my Windows 10 desktop, and what stands out is its minimal impact on system resources.

Not much else to report at this point, but so far I am happy with it."
"Bait & Switch:

Name stays same, but features and options disappear to a higher version.

Deceptive.  Wrong.  Lies.  DO NOT BUY"
Love these shoes.. they are so comfortable.
"I downloaded this application, after the installation it shows that it will be active or valid for only 118 days and not 366 days."
"My video editing skills fall under the basic guidelines, this package filled the need for some basic design concepts and was easy to use.  It did take a while to load but it's a large software package.

Pros:
-Easy layout of basic features
-Lots of options/templates for a quick start and consistent appearance
-Great 2d and 3D rendering
-Quick Processing
-Good interface

Cons:
-Snails pace install (Large software)
-Needs a fast processor or you lag a bit
-More advanced features are a little quirky to use
-steep learning curve if new to this program

Good program, over all it's a nice platform and highly recommended."
"Wordperfect Office X4 (14) Standard is a nice piece of software.  I personally don't use this kind of product much in my job but I honestly feel that it would be worth checking out for anyone who uses a lot of spreadsheets.  These are really easy to create using the program.
The basic features of this version are a word processor, slide show creation, email, and of course the spreadsheets.
The word processor especially is pretty easy to use.  Unfortunately it still falls short of Microsoft Word.  Still a useful program."
"While I consider myself very computer literate there remains one type of software I can't quite wrap my arms around: video editing software. Having played around with this product for the last several weeks it appears the mental block is still firmly lodged in place.

Flashback. When I first started really using computers in the late 1980s I had a tremendously difficult time understanding the concept of the ""root directory."" When I started dabbling with the Apple OS in the early 1990s I had a similar problem understanding the concept of the ""alias."" Looking back I'm amazed at how difficult I found what now seems to be such simple and straight-forward concepts. But then, ugh!

I bring all of this up because the fault with this software lies not with the software but with this user - Yours Truly. What I've played around with and read about in the very detailed user's manual (.pdf version is included) points to an incredibly powerful software suite. But I still can't quite figure it out (yes, I know even young kids are editing video these days, but it's also true that 2-year-olds seem to have no problem speaking Finnish either...!). I'm having a tough time even loading raw video footage and knowing what to do with it. It's not almost embarrassing; it's embarrassing.

The closest parallel I can come up with was when I had to learn WordPerfect 4.2 while in grad school. What an incredibly steep learning curve, but once conquered what incredibly good software. This is how I feel here; I can sense how good it is even though I can't quite get there yet.

Sad to say, then, that I am utterly unqualified to provide any real insight. But that might be the best thing I can contribute to the review database: there seems to be a steep learning curve, but if one perseveres the gains are sure to be there.

I know I'm going to keep plodding on in the hope that down the road I'll look back and wonder why I found it so difficult to use. I'm also hoping that I'll be able to look back and see that I've mastered the task (just like I did MS-DOS, Apple OS, and WP 4.2! Don't think I'll be learning Finnish, though!).

Summary: 4 stars. I can see how good it is (even if I can't quite get there). Doesn't change the fact of how silly I feel not being able to provide a better evaluation."
"It works, what else can I say?  I purchased it as a replacement for an older DSL modem in the hopes that it would do a better job of maintaining my connection to the Internet.  There were no installation problems (I use it in connection with a router) and it does appear to be slightly more robust."
Glad to have it.
"My computer runs faster with Titanium than with my old internet security (IS) system.

My computer was running so slow, I thought I needed a new computer until I removed my old IS software.  My computer started to run faster immediately afterwards, and didn't slow down when I installed Trend Micro Titanium.

All my software opens quicker, especially the internet.  It's more than twice as fast as with my old IS software.  All software opens on one click instead of three or four.  I can't believe I spent two years sloshing through mud with the old IS software.

Titanium has three settings:  1) Upload in full at start up (slows down start up); 2) Upload in part (start up is quicker - default).  Start up takes me only 3 minutes instead of 10; 3) Uploads only after start up is completed (fastest start up).

It takes up 259 MB of space, but says you need at least 500 MB for installation.

It allows for a Quick Scan which takes only 4 minutes.  This was a feature I missed with my old IS software.  With Titanium, you can choose to do a Quick scan, a Full scan or a Custom scan of specific drives.

The Full scan took 90 minutes.  Scanning slows the computer down...way down (which is why I took a star away).  That has not changed from my last system to this one.  I have yet to find an IS security software that I can use while surfing the net.

The software does not pop up with a reminder that I need to scan every time I turn on my computer.  Nor does it suddenly start scanning when I'm watching a video, causing the video to sputter.  Both were issues with my last IS software.  It allows the user to determine when to scan so you can wait until you are finished for the day to run one."
"The thirteenth of the Nancy Drew Mystery Series. Things are graded A-F, just like school.

The Crime: A -

Rich and famous wannabe Natalie has invited her favorite celebrites (including a New York cop, a television paranormal expert, a romance author and the Hardy Boys) to delve deep into the mysteries of a century-old train car. The owner of the train mysteriously vanished amid rumors of a gold mine somewhere in the American West. What's going on there? Before you can ask a single question about that, disaster strikes! Natalie vanishes! And it's up to you to figure out what happened.

Puzzles: A -

Some I thought were far too silly (like the dolls) but there was a huge variety of puzzles, from word puzzles to math puzzles (aargh!). For sheer inventiveness, Nancy Drew cannot be beat.

Gameplay: B -

Everything flows from one point to the next, and I rarely got ""stuck"" because the game (and the game's characters) do a good job of informing you (as Nancy) of what's going on and what you need to do next.

Unfortunately, I found this game to be a huge letdown in hours of gameplay. The box promises 20+ hours, but I finished my game in about 8. The same thing has happened for the last Nancy Drew game, Secret of the Old Clock. VERY disappointing.

Time Changes: This game operates in stages. The train travels endlessly until certain events trigger stops, such as the arrival in an old mining town in the Southwest.

Voice Acting: A -

I found some of the character's voices rather colorless, but the Hardy Boy's good cheer and friendly banter made up for that.

One character I loathed, in look and voice, was Fatima. You'll decide for yourself when you get to that point in the game, but it left me completely cold.

Music: A

Always in the background, never invasive, the looping soundtrack was pleasant but not particularly memorable.

IGraphics/Video: A +

The graphics improve with each new game. Stunning visuals.

Technical: A

This game comes with two discs necessary for installation, but you only use one disc to play. No switching is necessary. Perfect, as usual.

Overall, despite the extremely short gameplay time, if you love Nancy Drew, this one's for you. A Must-have."
it doesn't work on my pc
"I purchased this program for my new Vista PC and I was quite pleased with the new and improved features, which integrates quite well on a Vista PC. As a previous owner of Outlook 2000 and Outlook 2002, I have become reliant on the program for both work and home. I elected to buy Outlook and Office Student and Home to maximize my dollar towards my Office purchase and I have no regrets. The Office Standard edition does not include One Note, which is one of those programs that integrates well with the new Outlook. In the end, I spent less and got more.

I would not recommend (nor do I intend) to upgrade my Office 2003 for my XP notebook. Likewise, I would not recommend purchasing Outlook without a complementary Office edition. If you have a new PC with Vista, it's a good idea to use Office 2007 in whatever fashion is most economical for your needs. If you don't use Office, there are tons of great e-mail programs that are available at no charge and an Outlook stand-alone purchase makes little sense. I think Thunderbird/Firefox is a sound choice for the non-Office user."
"With the ability to capture receipts, warranties and tax information, Quicken Premier 2014 is a great way to begin your new year resolution to become more organized.  Not only can you stay abreast of your fiances, you can also keep important information about your purchases which so it is easily available at tax time, when an item needs to be replaced under warranty or in the event of loss or theft."
One of my favorite magazines.  Also like to reference the calendar for things to do.  Like lots of local info and travel ideas.
"Typical Microsoft; first thing I had to do was update the program!!!!
I will convert everything to Iword"
"SO glad I found this on Amazon and didn't use Norton's auto renewal (at a much higher price).
Installed fine and working just fine too!
HINT - I bought it at the low price, but waited til my current software was about to expire in a day or two, before INSTALLING IT......so I get the full 365 days use of product before I need to renew again."
"Don't let the pricetag fool you, this is a pretty advanced animation tool. This is 2D, character based animation at a highly professional level.

It's not incredibly easy or intuitive to use out of the box. But with a little training and practice, you can create and rig characters and animate them. You can record voiceovers and do lip-syncing. One could use this package alone to produce animations as good as most stuff on TV (given enough time).

The package comes with pre-rigged characters you can play with, and this is probably a great way to get started.

You'll have to put in some time to get good with this, and if you're brand-new  to animation there will be quite a big learning curve. However, this package is an incredible value."
"I couldn't wait to try Expose, and now that I have it, I hate it. If I had it to do over again, I'd stick with Jaguar. It was a lot more stable than this version of the OS. Of course, I'll have to have Tiger the minute it's released. Panther is still light years ahead of  Windows."
dont trust it
Works on my old PPC Mac
"That is a direct quote from the FTM knowledge base AnswerID 1403.

Even more frustrating, printing 8.5 inch x 10 foot charts did work well using my desktop Epson Photo R800 printer with FTM 2011, but ceased working when I upgraded to FTM 2012. In FTM 2011, Page Setup in the Chart Options box correctly read the user defined page size settings entered via Windows and the usual Epson interface. FTM 2012 ignores those settings and defaults to 8-1/2 x 11 even when roll is specified as the printer source.

So I'm uninstalling FTM 2012 and going back to FTM 2011.

By the way, I upgraded mainly to get the new Print Box on chart feature. Let's just say its capabilities are modest compared to similar features in other software. You can specify font, outline box, etc. only once, so there can be no variety in text added to a chart.

And FTM 2012 is definitely slower than FTM 2011 as many have noted."
"I got this for my 5 yr. old grandson, who is in kindergarten right now. He is just learning letters and their sounds. He is also learning to put the letters together and make small words. When I put this in the computer, I had to guide him through some of the things, but with others, he got it right away.

There are so many levels and games, that he hasn't even gotten through half of them yet, but he is really learning a lot. There are 10 levels, and so many activities, that this will keep him busy for years to come. He is the kind of kid that learns by listening, and is a hands on kind of kid. He loves this program, and now every time he comes to my house, he runs right to the computer and wants to play. That alone is worth the cost. I highly recommend this program for children, so they can get a jump on what they are learning in school."
"I was pleasantly surprised at all the features of this security system. The best features are the enhanced real time protection and the online protection for secure shopping and banking transactions, as well as the added protection provided for network and  cloud technology. There is customization available for email and browsing.

The software will download to three computers and provides free automatic updates through 2011. It was easy to install on Windows 7 and Windows XP and it doesn't noticeably slow my computer.  The software is easy to download and use. There is an easy one-click installation as well as more detailed options for those with more technical savvy, making it both easy and customizable.

I recommend this product for its ability to protect under various circumstances as well as its real time protection."
"Made the mistake of moving to Office 2016 from Office 2007. It is astonishing how little has been improved, and how many things have quite literally been diminished: keyboard shortcuts gratuitously changed or even entirely removed; useful functionality cut; less interface customizability than in the version from almost a decade earlier. What a travesty."
"It is worst piece of crap I ever had to install.  As a systems programmer, I can tell you that this OS is defintly not stable enough.  I installed the OS 20+ times in number of different systems.  The Windows File Protection, supposely designed to protect you from over-writing system files, interfere with installation process, and bring systems down the day after the installation.  The BOOT recovery did not work as documented, and in order to recover, you have to bring up recovery console, which is undocumented.  Installing Service Pack 1 patch the system but partitions over 8GB is not reconized, and MS Knowledge base suggested actions did not fix the problem.  At installation, it wriped out the Master Boot Record clean, which make me lose the access to number of different operating systems.  Windows Exporer Picture Browser format has been changed, browsing directory between Windows 98 and Windows 2000 would currupt the picture database, and crash the exporer.  After installation, running setup second time marks drive as ""Unreconized or Damaged"" partition even if the partition table is in perfect condition.  Once service pack 1 is installed, the system refuse to format these drives due to inability to access drive over 8GB.  Installed Microsoft Visual Studio and Watcom C++ v11 for programming work and the whole system went down after reboot with stop 0x7B, Inaccessible boot device error message.  The system wouldn't even boot in safe mode.  Back to system recovery console again! Install Driver for Symbios 53c785 SCSI controller, GeForce Video Driver, and adding different SCSI contoller sent me back to recovery console again.  The OS appears to be too unstable!"
fun to read
love the gift give them to many people.really a great gift thanks so very very very much. Thanks thanks thanks thanks
"This antenna is great.  I set it up at my house and it provides a good signal all the way to my guest house, which is 250ft away at least and with 5 walls between the computer and the router.  Worked better then ""extended range"" routers that were 8x more expensive.  If your router has a removable antenna and you need increased range buy this antenna, if you are worried it won't work buy it at Fry's and try it for a week, you won't be disappointed."
"Works well, no problems installing. Activates fine.  Seller SoftwareCW is trustworthy.  Never had a problem buying from that company."
"Out the box:
1 Installation Disc w/product key
1 Extras Disc
Instruction Manual
1 Free Cyberlink Cloud Services
Sheet w/other free apps like YouCam Perfect, YouCam Makeup, Photo Director Mobile (Free and Pay) and Power Director Mobile

I have Window 10 installed on the system that I installed this software on. At first it seemed like the installation process would take less than five minutes. I went to start a load of laundry, and when I came back the process percentage was 99%. It stayed there for a long time. Went to fold a load of laundry, came back and the Power Director was done installing, so I started the install of the Content Pack.

Currently, I use Adobe Products,for video Premier. Anyone who uses or has tried to use Adobe products know that there is a huge learning curve. None the less, I love them and would never give them up. However, after recently making an instruction video, I realized my knowledge base for what I was trying to do, was much too short for what I needed and when I needed it. I had used PowerDirector prior to Adobe. I want to say it was version 10, but not positive. I decided to try this software to see if I could use it for those times when time is not on my side and I cannot cater to my learning curve and produce videos fast.

As I said above, I've previously used a different version of this product in the past, so a lot of it looks familiar. So far no compatibility issues and I was able to make a simple teaching video using a few of the features like transitions. It seemed simple enough. I will be using it this weekend for a more difficult video and I will be utilizing more of the features. I like the fact that you get 20G of cloud space, but we all know that 20G is not a whole lot when it comes to video files.

There is a quick editor and a full feature editor option. I will update this review after I produce the more difficult project this weekend."
"Still breaking them in for use at the gym.  I think once I get used to them, they'll work great!  :)"
"There is honestly so much that can be said about a Antivirus program. These days, they have been more essential for all computers than meets the eye. It isn't just a security issue, it is a must against people and possible threats that steal your identification. I have used so many different pieces of antivirus software. Most of them are sharp at the heart of the matter, while others do not get very far into the computer, and protect you from any damage. I have used trusted brands before like Norton and McAfee, and they have been mixed overall. Some might work at times, while others do not even cut it close. This 2016 edition by McAfee might bee a good buy at first for the inexpensive buyer. But overall, you really do not get as much for your money. It does a good job at first, but some viruses have sneaked into the computer, and honestly they have slowed the computer down. This software also doesn't work as thoroughly as it could. You might honestly want to try a underrated brand like Bitdefender, which definitely is one I sincerely recommend overall you try. This one isn't worth the money.

Price: C 1/2-

Convenience: C+

Overall: C"
"I got this product to get some extra security when I am using open and public wifi networks. It installs surprisingly fast for a Norton product. It is also cross-platform, meaning you can use it on Windows, Mac OS, iOS, and Android. I installed it on Windows, Mac OS, and iOS. It works well enough and is simple to use. I agree with the others who report that it slows down network connection some. I definitely noticed a bit of a lag in connecting to resources with this on. It was not awful for me but it could be annoying in a situation where you need your information as fast as possible. I think this is a good idea, and is definitely necessary for developers in general to make products like these in the digital age. I hope future versions of this product will come up to par in terms of actual performance. Not bad, but not awesome either."
"Mcafee is superior to Norton in my opinion. I had Norton and it was like not having any anti-virus on your computer. Maybe they have improved now. It is amazing as at one point the biggest name was Norton but they didn't live upto the expectations.
Mcafee does the job. Recommended."
"Getting this installed via Amazon was a major headache because their invoice provided the wrong information.  What was listed as the Product Key was actually a Redemption Key which is used to get the Product Key.  I had to go through Microsoft's tech support to get my software installed which took nearly two hours to accomplish.  I was not happy and will never purchase Microsoft software from Amazon again.

I was moving up to Office 2016 from Office 2007 so it is a major change for me.  One thing I've noticed is that my old Office 2007 applications can still be used even after installing Office 2016.  Outlook 2007 is the only application that didn't work and had to be uninstalled.  This was a plus for me because I don't have the money to shell out for the full Office and I can still use Access 2007 without problems.

The only problem I had was Word 2016 couldn't handle one of my custom macros and my Quick Access Toolbars (QAT's) had to be recreated.  I use the QAT's so I don't have to search through the ribbon to find something.  I also haven't found a way to tag documents that have been opened like I could in the 2007."
"I have to be honest. If you do very little, this package will do very little along with you. I REALLY wish Nero existed for the Mac. Roxio's poorly stable programs, lack of features, and non-existent customer support makes for a pretty ill customer base. Ahh, but they probably don't care about that, they just want your money. So, if you'd like to donate $65 to the Roxio bank account fund-raiser, please click, ""Add to cart"".  Just don't forget you still need to buy CD/DVD burning software afterwards, mk?"
"This application is nothing more than a database of recipes, with little functionality found in other programs.  I purchased this to manage my own recipes from Mastercook, after having to re-image my computer and needing to buy new software anyway (can't find that old cookbook disc!).  I did some research, and the website convinced me to give this product a try.  I tried to use this to manage my OWN recipes, not surf through a collection already existing on the software.

CONS:
* Though it can import recipes from ""Mastercook,"" the recipes must be INDIVIDUALLY exported then imported.  If you have a backup of mastercook files, this will not work; you need the mastercook software to.
* There is no automatic calculating of nutrition data; it has to be manually re-entered after entering ingredients
* The interface looks crude and outdated; something reminiscent of cookbooks sold for $9.99 in the 1990s.

PROS:
Um....none.

I thought by spending more I'd get more. Oops, good marketing by the vendor, bad judgement from me.  Don't be fooled by the website lauding this product."
"It is great that you can purchase without ""shopping"""
"I installed Norton Utilities on my computer after using CCleaner for a few years. I can honestly say that Norton does a much more detailed job of cleaning things on my computer then CCleaner didn't get. However, there are things that I lost that I can't get back, including some of my passwords on websites that I forgot. I don't think I could recommend Norton Utilities, because I feel that there can be some improvements."
Husband and I enjoy the magazine.
Have to upgrade.
"Love this magazine.  It always has such interesting articles & short notes about new advancements in science and technology.
Thanks."
"Arrived quickly, was exactly as described, and seems very reliable.  The driver uploaded very quickly.  It works as described, and is very competitive price-wise."
"I'm mainly a Mac person. On my PC I don't own Office 2007 (I have the 2003 edition), and apparently without it many features of this software package don't work, such as background spell-checking and the thesaurus. Often I can't send e-mail, either. Frustrating!"
"My favorite body wash, suds up nice, leaves skin moisturized and has a nice subtle scent"
I got two each of these for my daughter and son-in-law. They love movies and don't get out as often as they would like.
"I was completely shocked at the improvement of this year's edition over last year's.  I expected slow and clunky software, but instead found more streamlined, user friendly software.

Setting up Norton 360 3.0 was simple.  The new version deleted the old version and installed itself.  Installation took about 15 minutes, making me reboot several times.

After it was up and running, it performed well.  It immediately found a Trojan without my having performed an initial scan.  This Trojan was probably lurking on my computer, which the old version of Norton completely was unaware.

Then, I set up the back up software.  Norton scanned for important documents and found files I would likely want to back up (images/documents/music/etc).  I was to able choose which of these files I wanted to back up and given options on where I wanted them backed up - to an external server, external hard drive, DVD burner, and so forth.  Included in 360 is 2GBs of sever space from Norton.  Obviously, this isn't enough to back up images and music, but it is enough to back up important documents.

Next, I scanned for viruses.  Norton found a few minor issues and deleted the malicious files.

Finally, I defragged my hard drive, which took several hours.

So far, I have been quite pleased with the new Norton 360.  It runs smoothly in the back ground and is far less intrusive than last year's edition.  I'm surprised that I can actually recommend this software."
Smells great..love the caddy.
"So I was pretty excited to try this version of Pinnacle (the last version I have is 17). There are a few new features (actually more for me since I haven't updated in a while) like stop motion animation capabilities and motion tracking.

However, this one seems more buggy than I remember the last version to be when I installed it. First, I had to completely uninstall 17 (I thought I could just update but you have to start fresh) before installing this. Its a large program and took a LONG time to install. Especially since I had to retry a few times due to error messages that even now are inexplicable to me. Anyway, I finally installed it in full with all the extra stuff. I installed this on a Sony Vaio with a fast processor so there shouldnt have been so many problems.

The program itself is VERY slow and there are so many issues with syncing, playing a video either didn't play at all or was delayed and there is no preview. For the life of me I cant get that preview window to function. Maybe there was a problem with the installation so I am (gasp) going to uninstall it and then reinstall it to see if that will fix it.

At that point, if I cant get this up and running, Ill just reinstall 17. I really don't understand how they can be selling this product for $100 (at the time of this review) for something that is so buggy and so frustrating to get up and running.

I really cant recommend this at this time."
Rather use Parelles which I feel works better for me.
"Kaspersky is awesome.  In my opinion the best anti-virus out there.  I have been using them for years now.  Have tried others, but came right back.  Also have tried Kaspersky Internet Security and came back to just the Anti-virus.  Works well and does not slow your PC down.  Highly recommended."
"I have been a Paintshop Pro user for nearly 18 years and have used it almost exclusively, even though I am also fairly proficient with Photoshop.  I have to confess, I was pretty nervous about giving up my old JASC Version of PSP (PSP 7) I am happy to say that it Corel has been very true to the old program and added some improvements. There are cool ways to do colour corrections and enhancing photos that I had not used before in earlier JASC versions of PSP. It now has the capabilities for mapping, face tagging and one click photo manipulations that were not available in earlier versions.

 The Paintshop Pro product has always been a more affordable version of other similar, higher end programs such as Adobes flagship program in its Creative Suite,  Photoshop. The learning curve for this program is fairly low and the instructions and tutorials both available with the program and online make it an easy program to work with."
"Christmas present.
My son loves the variety. Inviting look.
Efficient packaging. Arrived in a few days.  :)"
Perfect fit!
"I'm an intermediate user - not an expert, but not exactly a novice either. I've had experience with over a dozen different paint programs in the recent past, and do at least a little bit of work-related graphic design every day.

This program is different from almost anything I've tried before, and I have to admit it's easy for me to get lost in it. There are tons of options - well over a thousand paint type/brush type combinations, for example. And the perspective guide is new to me, a simple idea but is tremendously helpful. But there are so many options, I find it almost unusable on my laptop unless I'm plugged into my larger monitor.

This is definitely a *paint* program, not a photoshop program. This is a powerful tool for much more than tuning up photos or creating simple graphics. And don't let the box cover art fool you - it's not slanted toward ""fantasy"" work at all, even a classically trained artist (like my wife) can find tons & tons of opportunities here to create an impressionist work, a pointillist portrait, etc. It will take quite some time to learn to use it, and I'll probably end up taking a class on Lynda or something like that before going much further with it. So this is for advanced users, not for a novice and probably not a great place to start with graphic design. However, even with virtually limitless options & slightly overwhelming layout, it's also pretty intuitive and inviting for people like me who love to tinker."
This was a Christmas gift. The recipient is/was pleased. I would consider purchasing again and would recommend.
Keep my keyboard protected
Works great. I had another security system on my computer but once I installed the McAfee it showed me several things my other system had missed. Easy to install and does the job well.
"It would have been five stars if it weren't for infecting my test PC with OneDrive. It was a nice clean Win 7 machine and (rant on) I was pleased to not have to put up with one drive, the microsoft store, or all those ""features"" that assume I want my work machines to play music and games, download ""highly rated"" apps, and all that other sperg that gets in the way of actually trying to accomplish something meaningful (rant off). That said, the only unwanted install from office 2016 appears to be one drive. This will not be a factor for people installing onto Windows 10 machines because those come pre-infected.

First a confession - I've been transitioning my WIndows machines to LibreOffice because LibreOffice appears more secure. It doesn't phone home to provide ""usage statistics,"" and most importantly it doesn't run macros such as those exploited by that ransomeware that encrypts all your files. The further you are from those macros and from any autoplay functions, the safer you are.

But... I got a chance at a review copy of Office 2016 and decided to test out a few things. The install was easy. I had to enter the product code twice though - once before creating a new MS account and once after. Odd, but it only wasted a minute. Now, those tests...

First - can it be run without ever signing into a ""Microsoft account""? I don't want to log onto Microsoft's servers or risk unintentional uploads when I'm working on confidential documents, for example, documents subject to an NDA (non-disclosure agreement). No, you do need to create (or have) a ""microsoft account"" to install the software. This isn't particularly egregious because most commercial software requires such an account. It's just part of the registration process these days. Also, the account name is an email address and that address can be -any- email address. It doesn't have to be a hotmail account or anything like that but it does have to be valid because the registration process includes you verifying the address.

Second - can I run office 2016 without being logged onto a microsoft account? Yes. I edited files after restarting the computer and without signing into that MS account. I ran these tests on a Win7 machine but believe I can do the same with a windows 10 machine having a properly installed local account.

Third - can I run office 2016 offline? Yes. I disconnected the machine from the internet and restarted it. There were no issues creating and editing documents.

I did not test moving the license from one machine to another. I've done that with office 2013 and believe that it won't be that much of a hassle.

As for office 2016 itself. It's office - a package I've used in various forms for over twenty years. It does most everything I need and the menus and stuff are pretty much where they are in office 2013. That's what is most important to me - my productivity after installing new software. To be honest, for my usage this version is the same as office 2013 because I'm running 2013 on a windows 10 machine on which I suffer OneDrive and a plethora of other annoyances as well.

Now - what is up with my OneDrive disgust? It's that I need many gigs of -secure- storage. For cloud storage, there are HIPAA compliant providers who don't weasel strange crapware onto my computer. Some of those providers piggyback off of Amazon's wondrous cloud (AWS - amazon web services is a wonder to behold). I really want the ability to uninstall OneDrive (and many other odious bits) from my work machines just for security from malware exploiting stuff I never wanted anyway."
"Best magazine out there for its kind, truly a keeper in so many ways!!"
"Divine smell, cleaning properties and after-use smell! 5/5 stars."
"This is nothing more than a faster booting Vista.  Internet Explorer still sucks hard, freezes and is just plain useless.  The OS itself is still rather slow compared to any mac os, still no more secure than XP, same UI issues as Vista with a few new ones, and is still just as annoying to use.  The price bothers me too because after the epic fail that was Vista this so called *upgrade* should have been free or sold the way Apple sold Snow Leopard for 30 bucks which is reasonable for a mod or simple upgrade tweak.  Apple acknowledged that SL was an upgrade patch with tweaks to fix issues in Leopard not a new OS. Windows 7 is the same exact thing, just a patch for Vista to make it boot faster, with a new coat of paint........so why does microsoft need to double dip and charge consumers 100-200+ dollars for it.  After Vista Microsoft should have been ordered by law to make this ""improvement"" free or hold them at gunpoint and make them fix their slow, bloated, unreliable, crap OS in the first place.  The only thing Windows is good for is playing games which it does right half the time, can't wait until Mac gets a games licence then I can deleted my Windows 7 boot camp partition."
"Got my first issue and it seems to be nothing more than an advertising publication with a few mildly entertaining articles thrown in. I'm disappointed, I thought it would actually be about the American Cowboy and the life they live, not dude ranch, silver and hat ads. There is so much more to living the cowboy code than a fancy hat, caring about the environment, sliver and turquoise bling a bunch of tack on your horse. So far this magazine really misses the mark. I hope it gets much better real soon."
Nice for gift card presents
"I'm new to Apple/Mac, I finally bought a MacBook Pro after years of flirting with the idea.
I also grabbed a copy of Parallels 8 from the Apple Store and installed Windows 8. I'm not a big fan of Windows 8 but I need it for work.
I'm seriously impressed by this virtualization. I've done virtualization in the past (virtual linux and such) but let me tell you this is something else, especially in Coherence mode.
If I had known Mac + Parallels + Windows could work like this, I would have made the switch years ago."
"McAfee uses an outdated download filter which scans every packet before it is transferred to the browser.  The side effect is slower download speeds.  Well...their own live update program caused the install to crash three times.  The live update was averaging about 20 kbps.  For those of you unfamiliar with technology, this is half the speed of normal dial-up.  I watched the register go from 20...10...5...2...1...0 kbps.  Finally at 0 kbph, McAfee told me that I don't have enough bandwidth to do a live update and the install cannot complete.  Why is it that the biggest software brands are the worst ones to install?"
Wonderful
too much advertisement
"Great Packing, Good Shipping time. All as expected."
"Always good, easy, and accurate."
"I installed this product on all three of the desktops in my home. I can't say that it has fixed anything, but it isn't causing any conflicts or lag time in any of the machines, which is a huge plus. I can say that it did seem to take quite a bit of time to install-more time then I would prefer-but I guess that is probably a good sign that it is installing a lot of preventitive and protective programs.

Despite taking a bit of time to get the three computers installed with this program, I have had no REAL trouble aside from the program becoming unresponsive yesterday for no apparent reason. It caused a shut down of my internet explorer that I THOUGHT was a good sign (I figured it was something to do with an unsafe site I may have been on?) but then I wound up having one of those nightmarish error messages telling me, ""Trend Micro Internet Security has become unresponsive and will now close"" or something along those lines. I am still not sure what that was about-but I didn't really feel that great about it afterwards since the little red icon was missing and I was, at that point, unprotected from threats.

Overall, the ease of use is very simple and comprehendible for any beginner. Very, very easy to use. I like the Pro tool features-especially the system tuner, which cleared out over 400 Mb's of unwanted temporary files and unused programs.

As someone who is constantly plagued by viruses, I can't really grade this THAT accurately as of now. I have only had it for a week, but so far, it has performed fairly well. It seems to be a bit more steady and reliable then my former McAfee internet security suite (which froze on me ALL the time!).

I am also a little confused about the virus scanning on this. I have an additional program called Spysweeper which picked up a trojan on my computer a couple days ago, while this went unaware. That makes me a TINY bit nervous. I am not sure why this didn't grab the file first or stop it from entering before I even performed the spysweep program? Strange. Oh well! This is a decent program to help aid in computer performance and stability.

I think, if you are looking for a program you can get multiple computer uses out of, get this one. If you are looking for something for a single computer, I might go for a Norton Program instead."
Norton does not offer 360 any more. Have to buy a older version and have it up date.
I echo the positive comments of the other reviewers.  I had no problems with download of a state program (Windows XP SP3).  They didn't ask me to pay for it again.
"This game is super popular among ND fans. More than once Ive heard people say that its one of the best (if not the best) titles in the series. But it also has a reputation for being fairly scary and having very complicated puzzles. I guess it was that reputation that turned me off to this game, but I finally ended up buying it because I felt like I couldn't call myself a true Nancy Drew fan without having played Curse of Blackmoor Manor. I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.

PLOT  5/5:  This was one of the most interesting plots Ive come across in a ND game. Nancy has been asked by her neighbor, Mrs. Petrov, to fly to England and help her daughter. Her daughter Linda recently married a British diplomat named Hugh Penvellyn, but since her wedding Lindas attitude has drastically changed. She has become short tempered and paranoid and constantly getting sick, and by the time Nancy gets to Blackmoor Manor Linda has hidden herself away in her bedroom and refuses to show her face to anyone.  Blackmoor Manor has a storied reputation of secrets and witchcraft and for generations locals have believed it to be haunted by a werewolf-like monster called the Beast of Blackmoor. Its up to Nancy to get to the bottom of all of this to help Linda.

Like I said, I thought this plot was fascinating. There was so much detail put into the history of Blackmoor and the Penvellyn family history and I had so much fun unravelling it all as the plot went on. It was a great length and held my interest the whole time. I really have no complaints about the plot.

CHARACTERS  4.5/5: There was a really great cast of characters in this game. There was Linda, who I thought was very interesting and I wished I could have interacted more with her. The other residents of the house were Jane, Lindas 12 year old step daughter (also one of my new favorite characters), Hugh Penvellyns aunt Mrs. Drake, and Nigel, a historian who is currently researching Blackmoor Manor for a book he is writing on the Penvellyn family. There was also Janes tutor Ethel, but Ethel was different because you could only talk to her a couple of times over the course of the game. There was also Loulou, the annoying hint parrot. I really enjoyed the voice acting work and impressed overall with the characters.

SETTING  4.5/5: Blackmoor Manor was definitely an interesting place. It reminded me a lot of Wickford Castle from Treasure in the Royal Tower  especially the main hall. Blackmoor Manor was excessively decorated so there was plenty to look at even if some parts of it were pretty gaudy. It was huge and there was a ton to explore, not to mention lots of areas unlocked over the course of the story. I also really enjoyed the music in this game.

PUZZLES - 4/5: This was a puzzle heavy game. The puzzles ranged from ones that were quick and self-explanatory to ones that were incredibly complicated and took many different steps to complete. I used a walkthrough for most of it. I did appreciate how well thought out the puzzles were, however some of them were so long and complicated that it felt daunting having to complete them. There weren't really any chores in this game, which was good. The only thing that could come close to counting as a chore was that Jane required you to play a game with her before she would do anything for you. This was a little annoying but luckily her games were easy.

IS IT CHALLENGING? Absolutely. There was no way I could have figured out some of those puzzles without a walkthrough. 4.5/5

ENDING - 4/5: The ending was good, but not as strong as the other aspects of the game. The reveal at the end and the appearance of the culprit was kind of abrupt and a little underwhelming. The culprits motives made sense but I didn't really like who they chose as the culprit. But catching them was exciting and I liked how everything was wrapped up in the epilogue.

FINAL SCORE:
Plot: 5
Characters: 4.5
Setting: 4.5
Puzzles: 4
Challenge: 4.5
Ending: 4
= 26.5, divided by 6 = 4.41 rounded to 4 stars"

"While it didn't cause any problems for me, I don't see any major benefit either. Machine doesn't feel faster and overall there's no noticable difference. This doesn't mean it didn't do anything, any clean up is good, but I'm not very impressed."
Very easy to use!
"I've always really liked Corel products over the other options on the market, and have been using Corel (formerly Jasc) Paint Shop Pro for almost fifteen years.  I had no idea they had a CAD product (apparently this is another company's software they have purchased), but when I found out, I figured I would give it a try considering how much I like their other software.  In the past I have mostly used AutoCAD, and AutoCAD LT. Although this is the first version of their software, it is fairly complete and polished.  It is based on ARES Commander Edition, which I have never used before. I would say I am a beginner/intermediate CAD user, so the first thing I look for is software that's easy to use and fairly intuitive. If you've used any CAD software in the past, you shouldn't really have any problems with CorelCAD.  I found the transition between AutoCAD and it to be pretty easy and within about an hour I knew where all the basic tools were and had started some rough designs.  It is compatible with DWG files as well.  From a beginner's view, I liked how it didn't seem as clunky as AutoCAD.  Although advanced users might want more options, I appreciated a program that had all of the basic design options and tools that I needed without forcing me to learn a bunch of new stuff. This is the main reason I still do graphical design with Paint Shop Pro over Photoshop. I did several basic models and worked on some imports and noticed little feature difference between CorelCAD and AutoCAD (for my purposes anyway).  For those looking for a more professional drafting option, it may come up missing, but the much lower price point makes CorelCAD a great alternative for those who don't."
"Looking at this product and Windows 8 things are really going a route where the buyer is force fed the Microsoft diet.
This product makes your every day work more difficult.
If your hard drive goes and you need to download this thing even on a fast connection good luck. It took us over 90 minutes on a high speed connection in NYC to get the full download.
The pricing is ridiculous.
The installation gives you no options."
THIS IS MY FAVORITE SHOWER GEL.
"package arrived quickly and was perfectly packaged to arrive in excellent condition.
I got this upgrade with my quicken Premier and was able to take advantage of some additional savings.
I have been a turbo tax user for many years and the package is great and easy to use."

Work perfectly and on time!
I've been an IBM compatible computer user for years and was a Micosoft BETA tester for Windows 95 so naturally have a lot of Windows software. I recently became a Mac owner and found that many of the Windows applications I have had no Mac counterpart. Parallels seemed to be the answer. Using Parallels to run Windows reminded me of the days when Windows was an operating environment loaded after booting into DOS and it always felt that way to me. I encountered a problem in trying to print from Windows applications which rendered those applications useless. Attempts to get technical support from Parallels or Mac were fruitless. Parallels was unresponsive and Mac wanted $100 just to answer a question on the telephone. I had also purchased several Mac applications which were similar to their Windows counterpart but not as usable. I abandoned my Mac and returned to using my IBM compatible (which is nowadays called a PC). PC stands for Personal Computer which a Mac is also.
great food!!
I have used this before and had missed it terribly. It is a fabulous product that I recommend for anyone with dry course hair.
Perfect for giving a graduation gift card! The recipient loved the graduation hat it came in.
helps with taxes every year good product and easy to use
Good product.
The lavender scent and creamy texture is just what I hoped for.
"Ive been using TurboTax for many years to file my returns, and had always been satisfied with them prior to this. Ive used both the online and installed software versions of their product in the past. My tax situation has been complex enough that Ive had to purchase much more expensive editions of the product to handle all the forms, and Ive generally paid extra for the audit defense guarantee.

This year I had two issues that really soured me on their product.

First, in some situations Intuit won't let you retrieve and print prior years returns unless youve paid for the current years product. I cant remember whether I filed the prior year in their online version or the downloaded software, but I am buying a house and needed to retreive the prior return for the bank. The lesson here is don't just save your tax return in Intuits file format. Export it as a PDF, save AND print it for your records.

The second problem had to do with one form I needed not being ready. I started my taxes in early January and filled in details as the forms arrived. The warning that I couldn't file because a particular form wasn't ready yet kept coming up, and finally I started looking for help in the forums. I found an article posted by them which said the form in question was available for everything but E-File on Mac, and that it would be available for that final format on January 30th. Two weeks past that date not only is the form not available for E-File, but printing a copy of it produces a big watermark DO NOT FILE - FORM NOT FINAL even though its supposed to be available. I tried checking for updates and reinstalling as suggested but no luck. I was finally able to find a telephone number for customer service and speak to someone there after a 20-minute hold, only to be told they had no information other than what I knew from searching the forums, and no process for escalating my call to anyone who could help or even give me an updated ETA. I was promised a full refund for the software but have had to start all over on preparing my taxes and several weeks have gone by in which I could have already filed my return.

Intuit makes it hard to speak to anyone in the first place, and harder still to find anyone who can help you with your problems. Between that and the limited access to your own information that magically becomes no problem if you simply give them more money, Im very dissatisfied."
"I originally used WordPerfect and migrated to MS Office due to my work environment so it's been more than a decade since I last tried Corel's alternative office suite. Amazingly, as Office has become more convoluted since the 2010 version with useless task ribbons and endless security options, WordPerfect has stepped in to fill the void where you can find many lost MS users.

WordPerfect is practically 100% compatible in file formats, has some great PDF tools and a massive library of extra software and content. Many of the features that used to be simple in Office are well implemented here - columns, tables, footers, headers and all the features you would use frequently are very obvious. A few of options are different to Office but are easy to find and understand and overall this is simple version that's very fast and stable.

Comparing Corel and Microsoft in their latest office suites, my observation would be that WordPerfect has been developed with the user in mind (and many features have clearly been UI tested) where MS has approached the problem based around what they feel the user should like, given their predisposition to Windows 8 and touchscreen interfaces. Ultimately, it's a personal preference but if you've been frustrated with newer versions of Office, the WordPerfect suite might be a welcome upgrade."
"Have used H&R Block's Deluxe for many, many years. Started using Turbo Tax but switched to H&R Block's Deluxe after 2 years because of the cost difference. Have never been disappointed in the product through the years.
From what I have read about Intuit's Turbo tax for 2014 I am glad I stayed with Block.
I have  investments, deductions, and other tax forms I use in the Deluxe version.

Block's 2014 Deluxe installed with out an issue and updated 2x so far. After the 2/4 update I will actually start the taxes.
That is if all forms are up to date. Block 2014 will not let you e-file/finish if something is not up to date.
The key to successfully using this program each time is:
#1. Take your time and have the program transfer your data from last year. Does save a lot of time. Just make sure its up to date.
#2. Most important take your time and carefully read each question and answer it. If you rush and miss one it will land up possibly skipping something further into the program that you need. You can always go back and fix it.
I expect another successful year using Block 2014
If any issues develop I will add them to this review. I do not expect any  though."
"I operate a one-person consultancy. Microsoft Office Accounting Professional 2008 has a template for consulting firms with no employees. Sounds great, doesn't it?

  Well it is and it isn't.

  I can't speak for other consultancies. Mine is very simple and this program is overkill.

  Installation is relatively straight-forward, although non-accountants (like me) will find the set-up just as mystifying as with any other accounting program. Operation is kind of on the slow side, but the user interface is good.

  I found no negatives in the application,but I suspect that is because my business needs are so minimal. Judging from the help files, the application is very capable, but I question its adaptability to very small business environments like mine.

"I subscribed, I got it. I read it. Got tired of it, and cancelled. What's to say? Good recipes, articles a bit short."
"The shoes are true to size. I am used to wearing running shoes so these have been an adjustment. Overall, the shoe is nice and provides well for my HIIT and Grit classes I take."
Very silky and smooth is the results I received after using the product.
"I very much like iBank.

The first step was to  import the data from another system, in my case from Quicken for Windows. That part went pretty much flawlessly. The accounts and the information in them is generally spot on. The only exceptions being a few vagaries introduced by Quicken's quirky housekeeping. iBank's SUPERB customer support has been a great help along the way and no problem submitted so far has gone unresolved. Creating reports is a virtual ""no brainer"". It took only a few minutes to set up a year-end tax report and another that helps to track my history of charitable giving. Setting up links to my financial institutions went much smoother than with Quicken. Start-up is quick on my iMac and response time is quite good - very handy for a quick look at some item. File maintenance is a real strength with the ability to cut, copy and paste multiple records as needed. I also found, as a result of an error on my part, that any number of records can be deleted at one time.  As an aside, I have found that the free version of Dropbox is an ideal place to store backups, safely on a remote server.

The help section is quite complete and, most of the time, helps you avoid contacting support. Once tuned to the individual's requirements - creating reports, validating balances and the like - it appears to run smoothly and capture whatever it needs to supply a valid picture of one's finances.

That said, iBank is an unusual mix of being similar to elements of both Microsoft Money and Quicken. Parts are as intuitive as Money while others require a fairly steep learning curve. This is not so much a shortcoming of iBank as much as a certain laziness engendered by other financial packages that allowed us to ignore what was going on with our money. The hard part comes in understanding where cash is actually stowed. iBank does not yet have ""Sweep Accounts"" per se. We need to understand, for example, that a Vanguard account does not accumulate cash - it's either reinvested or payed to the account owner - cash balance zero. The mechanics of recording cash can be daunting and, I admit, as a very new user, that I am still learning how to do that well. The best so far is to maintain a central Vanguard account that handles the cash and reinvestment transactions only. This is also seems to work for my online trading sites. Again, I'm still learning

No doubt, there are other negatives to be found, but they are most likely the subjective needs of individual users..

The greatest endorsement I can give is that since installing iBank, I have not found the need to revisit Quicken."
"Okay, everybody needs to open and save documents in the various office formats.  But there are a lot of options right now: you can dual-boot into windows, or run windows in a VM such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VMware-Fusion-2/dp/B001F5VBRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VMware Fusion 2</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Parallels-Desktop-4-0-for-Mac/dp/B001K6OEV4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Parallels Desktop 4.0 for Mac</a>.  You can use OpenOffice, which is a free open source office suite.  or, of course, you can run the MS Office suite on your Mac sans-windows using Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac.

Personally, I do need to use Word and PowerPoint and Excel both at home and at work, and it's especially nice to have a native app, because I don't like running a VM if I don't have to (maybe if my laptop were newer I wouldn't mind letting a VM run idle all the time, but I so rarely use it that it seems silly).  Also, VM's tend to drain batteries on laptops, so I like to avoid using one when I'm not plugged in to the wall.  Interestingly, I often needed something other than Office 2007 for Windows because everyone else in the world had upgraded past 2007, and 2007 doesn't open the newer .docx file formats without downloading converters ... I've used Apple's Pages, Apple's TextEdit, and Sun's OpenOffice and of course MS Office 2008 for Mac.  To make a long story short: there are a lot of options and I've tried them all.  So read on:

FEATURES: Just what you'd expect: every feature, button, option, pallet, style, etc is available.  They're also very accessible (not a UI masterpiece, but since we've all been trained to the Office UI since birth, you'll be able to find everything you need). 5 stars.

FILE COMPATIBILITY: No problems that I've found.  Yet.  I'd used older Office:Mac versions and never ran into file formatting issues there either, so I'll give the benefit of the doubt that I'll have a similar experience.  Especially considering that MS now uses a fairly well documented xml file format (hence the new 'x' at the end of all your file names).  5 stars.

PROGRAM PERFORMANCE: Launches fairly quickly, works well, scrolls smoothly, etc.  Overall the app performs to the standards you'd expect. A bit slow opening large files (I wrote a 340 page book - and it opened in a little under 20 seconds.  In fact you should buy it, just for reference ;-)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cluck-Murder-Most-Fowl/dp/1419682644/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cluck: Murder Most Fowl</a>&nbsp;... anyway - 4 stars.

PROGRAM COMPATIBILITY: Here I have a major complaint.  I'm running a MacBook Pro with a 2.33GHz Core 2 Duo, and 2GB of RAM.  I'm a computer guy, I work for an information security company, I keep things patched and updated and running clean ... and ever since installing this, my system has been running slower.  I should have known better than to provide an admin password during install, as there's no reason that an office suite needs that level of access.  When Word or PowerPoint is running, it seems to get worse.  There are always 2 Microsoft processes running, one of which consumes about 2% of my CPU no matter what.  This is bearable overall, but it earns the product a 1-star rating for this category.

DOCUMENT DESIGN: Just in case anyone is looking for Word to create flyers and such, I want to say that if you are, look elsewhere.  Word is notoriously bad at formatting anything other than text-based documents.  If you own a Mac and need these types of features, get&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/iWork-09/dp/B0014X2UAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">iWork '09</a>&nbsp;and use Pages, which is great at creating vivid and lively brochures, resumes, menus, etc.  I'm not providing a star rating for this category, because Word should never be evaluated in this category by a Mac user (and this is Office for Mac, after all).

ENTOURAGE: A decent enough mail app, but again, why not just use Mail?  It comes with your Mac, and in about three months from now (in Sep 2009) Mail will support the few remaining Exchange features that Entourage can handle (and even entourage doesn't handle exchange accounts that well, IMO).  So again, no star rating here: only use entourage if your IT guy makes you. Wait, this is the Home & Student edition, so unless you're Bill Gates, you aren't running an exchange server in your home.  And if your school is running exchange, transfer.  Quickly.

OVERALL the product works, and the minor inconvenience of slowing things down will probably go unnoticed (or less noticed) on newer Macs than mine.  However, this flaw is largely responsible for bringing a 4.5 star overall rating down to 3 stars."
I thought I had written reviews for many products including Corel Paintshop Pro X7 Ultimate.  Somehow Amazon loses them.  I love Corel Paintshop.  I have been using it for years.  Does exactly as I want it comes to photos.
A trial version of this came with my Dell laptop.  It seemed to work so I bought a key.  It worked for a while with the key but now it doesn't work at all.  I will uninstall and do manual file backups.
"A great antivirus tool! I used Zone for many years, it would bog my computer to a slow pace when it would scan whatever I was doing. Not so with Kaspersky, it zips along scanning in the background yet allowing me to continue a a fast pace. It has all the bells and whistles as advertised. It went in very smoothly and had no problems installing it, understanding what it told me, and gives me a lot of control over my computers every move. I would recommend over any other on the market now."
I can see why it is free.
Easy and relaxing to read and covers many different parts of the world but not in enough depth.
Complicated.
"I have used many version of Microsoft office. I have been more than satisfied with each and everyone.  Why do I upgrade when satisfyed? Don't know.  But I would hate to be without Word, escel and power point."
"This is another spyware tool offered from the ether.  Currently, I run Windows XP SP3 with a hefty (75%) full hard drive and an old HP ZD8000.  I currently have an assumed ""clean"" system cleaned by Norton and McAfee.  This is the test system I used with PC Tools Spyware Doctor (PCTSD).

Cost: PCTSD is a little pricey.  It's $30, where most of its established competitors are $20, and some are even free (spybot, adaware).

Installation: PCTSD is a simple install.  Put disk in, auto-loads, and asks the basic install questions.

Performance: PCTSD didn't pick up anything on my HP, but again it is assumed to be a clean system.  However, when reviewing large zipped files, it stalled repeatedly.  This may be an indicator of a bug, but it is annoying nonetheless.  It also (like McAfee) likes to ping the network excessively to make sure your version of the software is legal.  Another annoying bug since once you first verify the software, it should not be able to be changed moments later to a fake version.

Overall: I think the average user should pass on this--too expensive considering the performance.  I'll stick with spybot and adaware until PCTSD gets an upgrade, and hopefully comes out less expensive."
I found it here at $5.00 a year special.  It fits in my purse. When its handy while I'm in waiting rooms. The articles are short to the point. The initial delivery was as estimated and its reliable each month. I check out monthly specials for magazines in our home. I also renew when the magazine goes on special again. It just adds to the length of subscription. Also subscription are easy to managed right here on amazon. I've changed addresses a couple of times since the magazines have started. With no problems.
I started using Web-root after reading some reviews and comparing antivirus programs. Web-root IMHO is one of the best. It uses few resources operates in a cloud and after installing my ssid drive on my desktop with windows 7 it runs a full scan in 15 seconds. On my slower laptop with newly installed ssid drive it runs in 1.16 minutes. It also has a firewall that runs with windows firewalls and can be setup to your liking. The price here at Amazon is the best and you can't go wrong with this software. Install it and you will never notice it is on until or unless an ad-ware or infection tries to enter your computer. It works great for me and I wouldn't use anything else at this time.
"This isn't a review, but commentary.  I don't understand how Amazon.com can have this available when it's not even available on the Symantec website.  There was speculation that it was to be released November 16, 2009, but that is today and still no mention other than here.  Why the 1 to 2 months shipping?  Also, version 15 is supposed to support Windows 7, but the information above only shows Vista and WinXP.

I love version 14 and have come to rely on it, but it isn't support in Win7."
Good deal
"Cute little box.  However, I will keep it for myself as I prefer the other boxes for gift giving."
I'm not a southerner but I still love this magazine.  There is a certain charm to the south and I enjoy it.
"I ordered this and tried to have a 15 day free trial installed to see if it worked and how well it worked. I wish I had tried the free install before I ordered it. I still haven't received the package yet but now know I want nothing to do with it or Norton. It would not install from the free download from Norton's site. It gave me an error after about 30 to 40 minutes of grinding. It took me to an error message with a link from Norton telling me to install a Microsoft package VISUAL C ++ 2005. I tried, it failed to install. I tried about three more times. searched the net for answers. none to be found. After about four or five hours of this, I contacted Norton support group for help. After a wait of about half an hour, I had someone start a conversation with me and he asked to be given a minute to ""REVIEW"" my problem. He left me for about another half an hour and the screen said he left the room. I waited, waited and another guy comes on and starts to troubleshoot with me. After about an hour, during which he is helping other people by asking me to excuse him for a moment, he gets the same error messages. He says ""CONTACT MICROSOFT, It's their problem"". If you have ever tried to contact Microsoft you realize how this came across to me. I have lost about 6 hours now and still have no solution except to cancel my order from Amazon. Norton just wants money, they could care less about people with problems. Stay away from all Norton products, there is no support."
"QB is a good product, just that the connotation of ""Quickbooks"" goes along with ""windows version"" when hear the product name.  I would skip the Mac version and instead go with a Windows version.  This isn't hard to do these days with Windows systems or an emulator easily being affordable.  This Mac version simply is not at the same level.  It's at least several generations behind the cheapest Windows version, and debatable perhaps being a decade or more behind in features overall. The other issue is that if you're not already familiar with QB's and want training, all the training will be for Windows versions.  You'll get funny puzzled looks if you even mention a Mac version to a QB trainer.

In this 2012 version, they only improved very little over the 2011 version (see my old review) and frankly I'm surprised the 2012 version wasn't just released for free for 2011 owners (it isn't) since it's such a small 'enhancement'."
"Not a good choice for most people.  Essentials only does allows basic functions and has very few ""reports"" available.

WORST feature - you cannot export QEM data files to any other financial software.  Intuit has allowed the data files to remain non-transferrable to IBank or to any Windows version.  They know the data cannot be exported and imported to other software and they do not care -- it must be part of their plan to keep customers.

SO BEWARE that if you buy QEM and use it for any length of time -- you will not be able (as of now) to import your data files in a useable form to any other financial software - such as IBank4 -- which is the financial software for a Mac that you should have used to begin with.  (The new IBank4 has many solid improvements and is a fully functioning financial software choice for Mac owners!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ibank-4/dp/B003WT1KAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ibank 4</a>

QEM is very basic and a minimal financial program.  It is not for any one who has used and liked other Quicken software or 0Money or a previous version of IBank.

Essentials is very limited and limiting!!!"
"I've used McAfee products before to good end so I was glad to install this program.  It was simple and straightforward which is always a good thing.

The first thing it runs is a check for existing problems which is another good thing as I had not locked our network after changing routers recently and I have been running my wireless network open again.

It took a few minutes to download and set-up.  McAfee found one incompatible software program, my last network security, and offered to delete it for me.  So thoughtful!  I did do speed tests before and after to see if it had effected my connection speed and it was not a meaningful difference.

The funny thing about it is the pulsing shield in the toolbar.  At first it was annoying but the couple of times it wasn't on, I went looking for it.  It is always nice to know something has your back."
"I agree with a lot of the reviews that say there is not a lot new if you are already using 2011 and maybe even 2010 but I highly recommend upgrading from anything older than that. I've used Quicken since it came out in the late 1980s. I've tried other products along the way and always come back to Quicken. I don't know what I'd do without my quicken.
When you first get started with the program, to take full advantage of it, it takes some setting up. How detailed you want to keep track of your expenses and bills is really up to you. For example. I have every transaction from every credit card and I've attached the receipts to each transaction. If I pay a bill with several areas of charges, like DWP, I actually separate my charges for water, power, sewer etc, all attached to the single credit card transaction. I can go back over years and tell you exactly how much I paid my kids doctors and for what. I also attach key codes for software I purchase so I always have them and manuals for my appliances. I even download copies of all my insurance policies and attach them to the payments so I can always go back and review my coverage; the pink slip to my car attached to the payment, contracts for work I have done.
I can also keep track of all my bills, when the closing dates are on my accounts and the due dates on all my bills. I don't need to get a bill in the mail to know when it should have arrived and when it's due. I can set links to the web sites of all the accounts I setup so that I can go to each web site and see just want the charges are and download them into the account. One of the best things is, I can back up all this information onto one flash drive and have everything I might need in an emergency."
Recommend getting children/grandchildren gift cards in this day and time of High Tech toys.  Easy to please with a gift card and no wracking the brain.
"I had Panther before, upgraded to Tiger now on to Leopard!  I just love the versatility of this operating system and do not regret upgrading to it.  My computer is faster and more rapid than ever, I did have to call Apple to reset my wireless modem first, but that did get taken care of.  Before resetting it, the modem ran slow and eventually didn't hook up at all but after resetting the wireless system, everything is great!  The features on Leopard such as the new mail box, Safari page etc. are very attractive and easy for me to access.  They work better than my tiger icons.  The dock is a bit smaller and more cramped but it doesn't seem that way.  I am also able to copy and paste more accurately than ever before.  I highly recommend upgrading to Leopard."

"CorelDraw Graphics Suite x4 is a great program.  I'm no techie, but it is easy to use.  I use it for banners, manipulating pictures, or creating drawings.  The possibilities seem to be endless, but again, I'm no techie.  I would suggest this program for those who are interested in graphic design.  This may even be better than photoshop!"
"I ordered this item as I purchased last year a Toshiba Satellite that included a DVD Movie factory by Ulead that works pretty well, very cool templates and other functionalities that have allowed me to create very good-looking DVDs. There were some opportunity areas (for example, if you add a music file to a menu you have no way to edit the audio file or select a portion of it, I have to use Cool Edit to format the audio file to what I need) So I thought the retail version would have more functionalities than the one I already had and decided to get this one.

First of all I had no problems installing it, while I am stuck with the awful Windows Vista, installation ran smoothly and with no incidents. The software comes with a manual that I honestly have not used, the features are very easy to use and so far I have not needed to consult the user guide.

There are three applications and only two of them I have used, the one I haven't tried I really do not have a use for it which is to extract video files from a camera or similar device. I own a Sony DHC and I use the basic windows functionality to extract the files from it.

The first one I'd like to talk about is the video editing software included. While it may not have as many functionalities as the retail box makes you believe, it has some interesting features. First of all, it allows you to select an intro theme to your video which then you can add music to, same as the DVD factory I previously owned, there is no way to edit the audio you use in here, so say the intro is about 10 seconds and you add an mp3 file of over a minute, the song will play over the menu AND your video. There is a neat feature that allows you to trim your video and select the bits and pieces you want to keep or remove. What I liked the most is that this program offers the possibility of extracting video from a DVD and then edit the video on your own. I tried several of my home made DVDs and some of them worked and some others didn't, which is a shame but I believe it might be due to the way in which they were recorded, the ones that didn't work were recorded with a DVD recorder I got to copy my VHS into DVDs. I also tried some music DVD's I own playing with the idea of creating a music video compilation, well, it worked. What the program does is that it extracts the selected video track from the DVD into an mpeg file, from there you can edit it or keep a backup copy of it if you like.

After you are done editing and preparing your videos you can then create your movie. So far I have only created DVDs and VCDs and it has worked great, there are several templates included, some of them look very professional and some others look like they were made in power point, fortunately, the menus can be personalized and you can add/remove things to your taste. In the case of DVD menus there is a feature that allows you to edit the background music, something I really appreciated as I won't have to rely on an external program to do so.

Overall, a great product with some neat functionalities, I have lots of videos I have taken with my Sony camera as well as others I have downloaded and I am happy I got this product. The only time it has failed is when I attempted to open a divx formatted file, it crashed. I have not really had the time to investigate if this is normal or if there is some kind of codec I need to download. I will update the review if I find anything on that."
"What's not to love about a plug-n-play little hockey puck which solves so many of my connectivity problems.  My Mac G4 MDD is notorious for having too few USB and Firewire connections, and a power supply which is a bit week for daisy chained devices.  This powered hub solved my problems and it was a simple as, open the box, hook it up, turn it on, and start using it."

Easier to use this year by making access to current tax file much easier than last year.  Like the immediate patch/upgrade check on login. Used TTax since it came out of a garage based business in my neighborhood.
"I have used Word Perfect on and off since the early 90s and have always enjoyed using it more than Microsoft products.  I have also done remarkable graphics work from Corel PhotoPaint and CorelDraw for years too, often having rave comments from other graphic artists who assumed I had been using Photoshop or Illustrator.

I had lost track of WordPerfect for a while, but with the X6 package, am amazed at how superior this product is compared to the Office Products that I had been forced to use due to computer issues.  What a breath of fresh air to be using WordPerfect Office instead.  I was hoping to have some problems to warn about or pointers to give, but so far, it is pretty easy and problem free for me!

So far, I have not had any problems translating files from Corel to Microsoft file formats, nor have I had problems reading files sent to me from the newer Microsoft programs.

The Quattro Pro spreadsheet program was great too- easy to use and follow.

The templates are helpful and useful as well.  I have used several of them when I am in a hurry and don't know what else to do.

The help files are all searchable online now so it is easier to access instead of having to pull out a manual.  I will say that the search engine is not always the greatest so you might have to play around with words until you find what you want.

I am still working on exploring all of the program that I can, as it is really enjoyable to use and work with.

I will continue to update as I learn more about the program and if I run into any problems worth mentioning.

I am using this currently with Windows XP but plan on transferring it to my Windows 7 machine I am putting together soon and will update with my experiences there as well.

As with all of the Corel choices, the price point alone makes it amazing, but the ease of use and lack of problems I have had so far make it truly worth taking a look at.  I am so glad I can leave my Microsoft by the wayside again.  I didn't realize how much I had missed WordPerfect until I got this Office edition!"
"As compared to Norton Internet Security, OneCare is much easier to get along with. Norton tended to block many programs for no good reason; OneCare does not do that. It is easy to set the programs to block or prompt in OneCare.

But the interface of OneCare is really inferior. The lettering is tiny and faint; not good for anyone with visual problems. But more serious, the program does not tell you what it is doing. If you click for an anti-virus scan,it merely says that a scan is in progress, but the progress is not indicated. You can't tell how long it will take or where it is working.  When it finishes, there is no report, at least if it does not find anything. So you don't know what it actually scanned.

If you press the button in the shortcut menu to scan a particular file or folder, nothing seems to happen. Maybe it is doing a scan, but there is no way of knowing.

There is a ""Tune-up"" feature which, again,only says Tune-up in progress. There is a button to get a report, but the button does not work, and no report actually comes out.

Interestingly enough, the anti-spy, anti-malware feature, a separate program called Windows Defender, has exactly the right interface. When in operation, it clearly shows what it is doing, and then gives a meaningful report when finished.  Why can't OneCare do the same?

OneCare certainly has potential, but its interface needs work."
"Having worked with Windows 8.1 for a while now, and having also worked with various other devices/operating systems, here are my opinions:

Windows 8.1 vs Windows 8.0: Why compare?  The upgrade is free and there is nothing but upside.

Windows 8.1 vs Windows 7: In my opinion, Windows 8.1 has all the functionality of Windows 7, and then some.  Some folks really seem upset at how the start menu was changed, but it took me about a day to adjust to that.  You can still find all of your apps using the same keystrokes (or mouse clicks) that you already used.  The ""look"" of the tiles popping up rather than a long list of apps has changed, but that's really it.  My advice - if you're already on Windows XP or later, ignore the naysayers and make the upgrade (assuming your PC is compatible).  Then give yourself a week of using it steadily before you pass judgment.

Windows 8.1 vs Mac OS: In my opinion, Windows 7 pretty much gave me all the benefits of the Mac OS (I know I'll get some negative comments for that, but I truly did use both and came back to Windows when they came out with Win 7).  So, based on my previous paragraph, I think Windows 8.1 compares well to the Mac OS.  Unless you're using Windows 8.1 in tablet mode, I don't think I'd go so far as to say it is vastly superior to Mac - only comparable.

Windows 8.1 vs iPad: This assumes you're using a tablet with Win 8.1 (I'm using a Surface Pro).  I tried using an iPad for a few years and other than playing games, surfing the web and checking email, it never seemed to be a great device for me.  I wanted something I could type notes into and even work on documents.  I tried adding a keyboard and apps that worked with Microsoft Office.  But just never seemed to quite work for me.  Essentially, I only did the kinds of things with my iPad that I would do with a phone.  With Windows 8.1 on a tablet device, I get nearly all the benefits of an iPad (though iPads do still have some advantages in tablet mode, such as form factor, weight and battery life - but none of those matter much if I can't be productive) AND I get all the advantages of a laptop PC.  And without lugging two devices all over the place.

Using Win 8.1, I dock my Surface Pro at the office and it is a full powered desktop computer with fullsize keyboard, mouse and monitor.  When working with clients, I have a small keyboard, or I have a stylus that allows me to take handwritten notes and draw pictures (this can be a big deal when you're consulting - a keyboard puts a ""wall"" between you and a client, and trying to use a stylus with an iPad to take notes was a non-starter for me)."
I used this to make calenders. I an going to give these as X-mas cards this year. It was Easy to use. I also used this for scrapbooking all my photos. This will save you time as well as money. The templates are great. You can also make cutouts  and embellished designs as well as spreadsheets . I admit it took me sometime to get it started but after 15 minutes I was able to do the layouts and pick out templates.
"At a hundred bux retail, I expect a lot from a piece of software. This player does a lot ... BUT, do you really need it? Ultimately, that's up to the individual buyer, but for me the answer was no.

PowerDVD does a lot.

- Playback of DVDs and Blu-ray movies (including 3D!) with resolution enhancement
- An interface to use with a remote
- Media playback via other pcs
- A cataloging function for your photos, music files, and videos

Sounds great. But for me, I really don't need these things. I just wanted to open a variety of video formats without switching between players, like AVI, WMV, MOV. I don't need a lot so this software was over-kill for me. I do plan to test it on my network. I'm hopeful that it will work on devices I don't have a DVD player installed, which would be great for today's netbooks & ultrabooks - although it looks like I might have to purchase stand alone players for each device for that. I will update once I try it.

Is PowerDVD 13 Ultra for you? You decide. It's a wee bit expensive, and I'm glad I gave it shot. If you liked earlier versions, you'll probably like this one too.

Is it the ultra experience? Probably not."
Nice to have when needed to crave hunger
"I received this software as a vine program review item, but would have bought it anyway. My wife teaches Transitional Kindergarten, and as part of the open house presentation and as a gift to the parents with the children's memory books, she videos the children at various activities throughout the year, and we make a DVD of a compilation of the videos. Roxio Creator is an easier to use than some of the more expensive competitors software. I easily move the videos off of the computer and onto a DVD for the parents ( it is amazing to see the growth of the kids from 4 years old to 5 and it is something they keep forever). In any case I like Creator and recommend it."
"I know it's trendy to not be, but I'm basically a Microsoft fan.  I'd rather use Word or Outlook than the open source alternatives, same for Internet Explorer over Firefox.

So, the fact that this software was built by Microsoft appealed to me.  And, I like the idea that I see its little integration box within my Microsoft Office applications.  I like that seamless feel.

But from there, other than creating some generic-looking maps for Powerpoint, I'm not sure what this program really provides.  It provides directions and mapping, but Google, Yahoo, and Mapquest do that without buying this package.  You can send directions to your phone, but that's nothing new, either.

I was hoping for some ""Pushpin"" wizards to create some graphic-oriented tools.  I didn't test this product with Microsoft Access, so it is possible that I didn't push hard enough in trying to discover this program's capabilities in this way.  But, as a stand-alone or with Excel, it seemed less dynamic than I was hoping.

I've seen the demos on-line and I think it may be much beefier of an application than I'm giving it credit, but, if so, it's not very intuitive.  If you see something specific that looks like MapPoint will address, this program probably won't disappoint.  But, if you think you might use the features but aren't sure, I'd recommend passing."
Fabulous
"March 15, 2009: I wrote a review for ZoneAlarm (see below) over a year ago. Recently I updated my computer to version 8. The problem with ZA being a cpu pig continues to be bad. The process scanningprocess.exe still hogs the CPU every time you try to use the computer.  Turning it off under  ""antivirus - advanced options"" restores the performance of your computer at the expense of ZA not scanning every file that comes into the cpu. Most of the files that you use are simply routine application files that ZA checks over and over at the expense of bringing the performance to a crawl. What you want ZA to check are new files that it has not seen before, but ZA is not smart enough to make the distinction. Norton Security Suite used to be the champion CPU pig along with McAfee, but Norton has now solved the problem. Both XP and VISTA will run smoothly with Norton with only a very modest tax on performamnce (unless you look you will never notice its tiny affects). It's too bad. ZA has been my favorite for many years. I like the level of control it gives you and I like the near-perfect firewall, but the perfromance hit is too much. Now, Nortin has improved its firewall and Antivirus components to match or exceed ZA. For me it's bye-bye ZA, and buy-buy Norton.

Previous Review
ZoneAlarm 7.1 for Vista is not ready for retail sale. Once you install it with Vista, your computer will likely slow to a crawl. The reason is simple (for most people).  Zonealarm security suite will continuously run two processes, both called scanningprocess.exe, that along with another ZoneAlarm process, VSMON.exe, will consume most of your cpu. There seems to be no way to turn this off. On my machine, a new Lenovo with 2GB of ram, the cpu useage bounces around from 17% to 90%, with most of the time being above 50%. WIth so much of the computer's resources consumed, there is little left for you, the user. Plus, if you do something,such as starting a program, the useage jumps even higher. Finally, even though ZoneAlarm has just finished updating its files, it will continuously run updclient.exe, which takes up about 25% of the cpu.  The company that produces ZoneAlarm, CheckPoint, will not respond to customer inquiry about this problem. So, go ahead and install it, and see if I am right. Oh, I forgot to mention, once you install it, it is hard tocompletely remove the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zonealarm-Internet-Security-Suite-3-User/dp/B000Q1N7FS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zonealarm Internet Security Suite - 3 User</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ZoneAlarm-Internet-Security-Suite/dp/B000HKPB3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite</a>program.

After posting this message, I have found a way to ""solve"" the problem of ZoneAlarm being CPU pig. You will have to turn off ""On Access Scanning"".  Go to the AntiVirus/AntiSpyware tab and click on ""Advanced Options"", the click on ""On Access Scanning"".  Uncheck the Enable Box. Click OK.  In a few minutes your computer should return to normal civilized behavior.  You have lost a valuable feature, but, hey, you can actually do something useful on your computer.  This problem does not seem to affect the older versions under XP.  Good Luck!

"This used to be my favorite magazine, but it has declined. This is the first year that I decided not to renew it after buying it for decades. The magazine seems to have evolved into a sarcastic gossip rag with a heavy emphasis toward the horror and superhero fan base. Not my preference. There used to be a wide range of tastes and good reporting. I could depend on at least a few articles in every issue while skipping those that held no appeal. The last several mags were a drudgery to skim through. Not worth my money."
"Everyone knows Sesame Street has been on tv for decades educating and entertaining children and now it's also a great educational game for your LeapPad or Leapster Explorer. The Sesame Street Solve it with Elmo, Abby and Super Grover 2.0 Learning Game game is recommended for ages 3-5 and older or more specifically grades pre k-Kindergarten.  The Solve it with Elmo, Abby and Super Grover 2.0 game includes 4 different games which teach your child about Logic and Reason, Problem Solving, Engineering & Physical Science. My daughter loves the ""Keep Abby's Boat Afloat"" game and plays that one the most. This is a great game for any child who enjoys a challenge, and even if they haven't watched the tv show they will soon get into the game. 10 out of 10, way to go LeapFrog!

update: This game will work on all Leappad systems (including Leappad Original, 2 and Ultra) and will also work on the Leappad Explorer system."
LOVE IT!  The smell is intoxicating - reminds me of my fun time spent in Sicily every time I use it!  Think it would be great for men or women.  The bar soap is also yummy.  Would love some shampoo or perfume if they made it...
"I find this program harder to use the Word 2007. The new ""clean"" design makes it take longer to identify buttons and to click on them."
I love Country Living and th gentle and simplistic style of this magazine and great articles.  Recommend to all gentle souls.
"When my Kaspersky Pure (KP) Total Security expired, I decided to try the Kaspersky Internet Security 2012 (KIS).  It has the same protection capabilities of KP but lacks Management functions (Control Center for all PCs in one's home), and Remote Management of Parental Controls (to  block contents non-suitable for children), and some All-in-One features such as Password Manager, Scheduled, automatic data backup, Encrypted data vaults, and File Shredder.  The extra features are useful but not absolutely necessary; there are plenty of other programs that provide the same services.

Overall:  KIS functioning silently in background and updates are automatic and fast compared to Norton Internet Security.  Nothing is foolproof but it's good to know that KIS is providing solid protection when my family is doing online shopping, socializing, banking, bill pay, researching, etc."
very good
I simply cannot state the excellence of this software.  You will not be sorry for this purchase.  I give it a two thumbs up.
Tried many but this is the one to buy.
"I have this running on two machines.  One my laptop/tablet, and the other my wife's pc.  In both cases I fairly happy with the performance.  Once very nice feature is that after installing the product on the 2nd machine, the installation on my laptop detected it and ask me if I wanted to manage it from my laptop.  Its not quite an enterprise level management interface like we we use in IT but more than sufficient for for home users.  Over-all I would say this product is on par with the other major competitors like norton and trend micro."
"If it were possible to give Vista a negative rating I would do so.  Vista is unlike every other Microsoft Operating System ever produced.  Every new Microsoft Operating System came with its annoying little bugs.  Those of us who liked Microsoft Windows myself among them usually got used to living with the MS bugs or ""Features"" as they are called by the company.

Vista was inflicted on PC users because somewhere Microsoft got the notion that a more complex difficult to use memory hogging buggy wizard filled operating system was more secure thus much better.  Vista is indeed far more secure than any earlier Microsoft product for one basic reason it never lets you do anything.  You can not be productive on Vista unless you jump through more operating system generated hoops than you will ever see during a lifetime at the circus.

Don't get me wrong.  I am not one of these geeky guys that wants everyone to switch to Linux or Apple.  I love my Microsoft Windows XP PC but, Microsoft Vista is a gigantic LEMMON no amount of Service Pack tweaking will ever fix.  I have XP systems and I will be keeping my XP computer.  If I buy a new computer with Pretty but way lame Vista pre-installed I will reformat my disk and install my trusty capable XP operating system workhorse.

To say Vista is super slow at start up, during regular use and at shut down is an understatement in its most profound incarnation.  If you buy a system with so much memory, new graphics, sound and other high priced, hogh powered hardware producing a system that costs a kings ransom Vista will speed up a little.  Vista is a money hog because many old XP devices do not work on Vista at all and others need lots of tweeking to get them to work.  Now Vista is so improved it will never crash, naw Vista just freezes up so completely you can not do anything productive.  Vista will make you more productive because all its freeze up's will have you doing the same work again and again and again and again hoping it won't freeze before you can save it!

Finally Vista is a big useless paranoid fat nag.  I mean at every turn Vista wants to reformat, check or otherwise make sure something you are doing is allowed.  Vista is the Fort Knox of Operating Systems but think about it who wants to live and work in Fort Knox.  Vista is an operating system as such it is an extention of your home or business.  Adding Vista to your computer is like stationing thousands of nagging police officers whose job it is to challenge your every move every time you become even the least bit productive.  Vista is an operating system with so many paranoid subsystems built in that it is effectively useless for its intended productive purpose.

For all the reasons I list herein I would strongly advise against purchasing Vista.  I feel Vista is the prettiest operating system Microsoft has ever produced but under that pretty surface is a code full of maggots that grow into extremely pretty productivity killing computer bugs."
"I was initially hesitant to purchase this instead of Turbo Tax due to the problems listed in these reviews.  I did end up buying Tax Cut when it was a Gold Box Special.  I just finished e-filing both my federal and state returns.  Everything worked out fine (with the exception that I owed taxes).

The only minor issue was that when I put in some information on an investment, it flagged a deduction entry as a potential problem.  Rather than guide me though what the potential problem was, it just referred me to an IRS publication.  I read the instructions, did not really understand the IRS directions, and so just continued putting in information in Tax Cut.

Otherwise, everything went fine."
Absolutely...exactly as described
"I bought this product after reading about AVG and its glowing reviews.  However, I had a problem with the install on my second computer.  The firewall simply would not install.  I tried the online fixes at AVG's Website but none of them worked.

I had to email ""customer support,"" since apparently AVG is too cheap to provide a phone number.  Someone named Lakshmi, I am sure from India, emailed me back but his fix did not work.

I would recommend Trend Micro over this want-to-be anti-virus.  Trend has toll-free technical support and you get to speak with a live body, instead of being hung out to dry with second-rate support from India!"
"A good, simple to use tax package for the average individual tax preparer.  I've use this program for years with a minimum of issues."
"To level set, I've been using BitDefender for close to a decade.  I've always found it to be a very good program for detecting things, a bit heavy on the resources, and a bit twitchy on the system.  The version i have is the same as the one listed, however it's a free upgrade from the previous version to run out the remainder of my license.  If you want the short version, I've already purchased Bitdefender Total Security to use once this runs out, so it's safe to say I recommend with minor reservations.

They did seem to listen to customers with this new version.  Gone is the ""You don't need scheduled scans."" stance they took and it's replaced with an ability and recommendation to run them.  First thing, people like to see it running so as a marketing gimmick it's probably a good idea even if it's not strictly speaking required.  Second, given the software may be disabled at certain times, it probably is a good fail safe to do a run from time to time.  Nice to see that back.  It also doesn't seem to be quite the performance hit that it once was, though to be fair the only computers I'm running it on are an i5 laptop and an i7 desktop, which both have quite a bit of RAM so I can't say how it will run on a low end system.  Given past versions, not well.

You can run in either Autopilot mode or user mode.  I personally like the latter because the former will ignore any custom settings you make and I like to do a fair amount of tweaking.  Compared to some other programs, you can't tweak a lot, but you can do things like make it ask instead of automatically scanning all removable media.  I usually disable the vulnerability scans since I run Windows Update often myself anyway.  One nice feature, it will do very limited credit monitoring for you for free.  They're not exactly doing it to be nice, the trick is it will give you a scary warning ""Something has changed!"", but you have to pay to figure out what.  Last time I saw it, it was that I'd opened a store credit card.

Otherwise, some of the same old problems remain.  Expect to have to do a ""repair install"" (uninstall the program as normal and it's a choice) to restore it to working condition every few months.  It's not a huge deal as it recalls the programs you set up to automatically go to Game Mode (closest you can go to disabling the resident protection), but it will lose any settings you have in the secure browser.  Oh and that brings me to my major complaints, the secure browser is incompatible with Acronis True Image that manages my system backups.  Guess which program wins out?  So yeah, useless to me when it worked find in the last Bitdefender.  The other truly awful thing is the new Wallet.  It's intrusive password manager and you can't turn it off without disabling startup items in your registry (msconfig) as well as disabling in program.  Really, my biggest turnoff.

Update 05-16-14
---------------
I found out a very important piece of information.  If you try to do a SystemRestore (not a reformat/refresh) in Windows 8 (Windows 8.1) while Bitdefender is installed it'll very likely perpetually fail.  If you uninstall Bitdefender, Windows System Restore should work.  However, once you successfully restored your PC, Bitdefender will probably be 1/2 way installed and not work.  I can't post a URL here, but if you go to their base website and just add /uninstall at the end of the address you should get to their uninstall tools.  Download one of those and it'll clean up the mess.  Then you'll have to reinstall the antivirus from scratch which is annoying, but at least there's a workaround."
this new corel version is the worse I ever work with since I star with corel 9. it crashes for anything and the program is too slow .and frustrated. even if you rise the  ram on the memory still pretty dawn slow .not recomended
"As a product that claims to provide powerful accounting and reporting functionality that is even more simplified in the newest version, I would have expected more.  If setting up a company from scratch, the software behaved fairly well and the setup was fairly straightforward.  However, in doing a conversion the upgrade path was troublesome.  The user interface was well placed and organized, but wasn't advanced compared to other accounting software I have used.  There were many features that I would consider premium, unless of course, you are taking into account their service and support pricing road map.

It really appears that Sage is trying to get you to buy into more of their services.  You could be easily looking at additional investments for payroll services and future upgrades that offer little benefit.  For small startups, Sage 50 Premium could be an excellent buy, although I would be concerned about future support and services.  For businesses on other established systems or those are growing quickly, I would really weigh the options and look at a more versatile package.  In my prior work in accounting systems, you really want to look at how much customizations you might need.  Sage 50 Premium is actually pretty good if you go with all of the canned functions.  However, if you require customizations you might be digging a ditch that you cannot climb out of cheaply."

It was just what I wanted.
I've used this card once.  I took a screen shot of card with my cell phone and cropped it to size to use just like a regular plastic gift card.  I just show it when I make a purchase and voila!  Payment complete.
I sent this gift card to my sister for her birthday and she loved it!  She always enjoys getting Amazon gift cards for birthdays or any special occasion since there are so many things you can buy with them.  Great gift idea for anyone!
"Was running Microsoft Vista, upgraded to Windows 7, made big difference in my office computer.
GREAT Upgrade, low price, E-Z install."
The best book reader software
"This is a pretty good, and richly featured program for photo editing.  It will do what I need to do, and the price is very reasonable.  Clearly, professionals prefer that other product, but this one is fine for non-pros, costs a lot less, and is quicker to learn.  I teach photography at our local college, and I recommend this one for those who find the other too pricy."
"If you have multiple computers at home and you want a good internet security suite, this is for you. It is easy to use and quick to install. I have it installed on a mix of desktops and laptops."
"This was my first experience with a Kaspersky product. My experience was not at all unpleasant, but it wasn't spectacular either. The product installed without a hitch on a computer running Windows 7 64-bit. The interface seems somewhat dated and the program appears to be something of a resource hog, though nothing equals the Norton products of a dew years ago when it comes to awful performance.

  How well does Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2014 work? I can't tell you. The computer I tested it on sits behind two firewalls and I never open attachments from untrusted senders. The Microsoft and BitDefender programs that were on this system for the past three years never reported a threat or quarantined s file.

  So I turn to the reports of independent testing labs for their analysis of Kapersky. PC Mag had three independent labs test it in addition to their own tests on malware infested computers. All of them reported substantial success with Kapersky. I am unable to duplicate their test setups, so I have to take their word on it.

  My estimation of Kapersky Anti-Virus is based on ease of installation (no problems), ease of use (average - didn't need to read the instructions) and performance (slow and bulky,like most - but not all - the AV programs I've used).

  So would I use it based on experience and, perhaps even more importantly, the reports of the independent testing labs? Yes. But overall, I'd reach for BitDefender first.

"I had two previous versions of DRAGON, and found them slow and clunky.  This version, though still painfully slow to install, works much better.  There appears to be less lag time when using it, and navigation is easier.

The enclosed headphones come with the adapter if your laptop has only a headphone (not an additional microphone) jack, so you can use it right out of the box.

Recommended."
"I've had this installed on an old netbook for some time and it's working really well.  The netbook isn't exactly a powerful machine (Atom CPU) but I don't notice any slowness.  The user interface is fairly straight forward.  There are basic menus for each of the sub features such as Anti-virus and parental controls.  I seem to get fewer pop-ups than I did with Norton, which is nice.  Overall a good product."
I returned these as they were not true to size. They ran large.

"OK, let me start off with a slight beef I have with marketing in general.  There's a pizza place near me that doesn't sell ""small"" or ""medium"" sized pizzas (this has a point, I promise).  It DOES sell ""large"", ""huge"", ""gigantic"" and ""enormous"" pizzas.  I can usually remember that the 12"" is called ""large"", but I can never remember if it's the 14"" or the 16"" that is ""huge"" or if the 26"" is ""enormous"" or ""gigantic"".  In the end, I just say either ""your second smallest"" or ""the 14-inch one"" because that makes much more sense and I'm certain to get what I'm expecting.

Software companies often do the same thing.  In this case the most stripped down version is known as ""Deluxe"".  ""Deluxe"" is defined to mean ""luxurious or sumptuous; of a superior kind"" and yet that's the exact opposite of what you get when you buy the ""Deluxe"" product (just like when you buy a ""large"" pizza, you are really getting the exact opposite--a small pizza).  The next version up is ""Ultra"" (that's the one I have) which means ""extreme"", ""at the edge"", or even ""beyond"", when in fact it is a mid-level product.  Then you have ""Ultimate"", ""Ultimate Suite"", and finally ""Director Suite"".  Having this many versions is bad enough, but the naming is downright confusing and drives me nuts... to the point that I'm going to have to remove a star.  Sorry guys.  Now cut it out.

<pauses for a breath... trying to find a happy place... sigh...>

As for the software itself, I have used PowerDirector 12 for a while now and have appreciated it's user interface and feature set.  A year or two ago, I was working on what appeared to be a very simple project--I imported a movie I had gotten online (legally downloaded, I'll have you know) and was trying to edit it for time so a co-worker could use it in a presentation.  The effects were all very simple: fade in/fade out, etc. but even though I spent a couple of hours with various video editing programs, I could not get it to work for me.  As I recall, Adobe Premier Pro CS5 couldn't understand the input file format so first I converted it with an AVS4You program.  Then I had it all edited the way I wanted, but Premier had a zillion and fifty output format settings and I couldn't seem to find the magical combination that would work on my co-worker's Mac and still be a reasonable size (either the file was HUGE, the quality was TERRIBLE, or it just wouldn't work on the Mac).  Next I switched to Pinnacle Studio 14, but it had issues, too--I don't remember what they were, but it was obvious that Pinnacle was a no-go.  Finally I tried PowerDirector.  It was more or less the first time I had used the program, and yet in under an hour, I had a fully rendered video that was a good quality, reasonable file size AND it played on my Windows PC and my co-worker's Mac.

As a side note, I'm pretty sure that Premier Pro can do all the things I've used PowerDirector for, but the darn program has such a learning curve that I often spend a good deal of time just trying to figure out how to do something as simple as fading from one clip to another.  Oh, sure--once you know how to do it, it's easy and once you have been working with the program for a long time, you'll probably find features much faster, but for a novice like myself, it's usually just a frustration.  PowerDirector, on the other hand, has an interface that to me is very intuitive.

You can go to Cyberlink's web site to view all the new features in 13 from 12, but in my opinion, the most noteworthy change is the addition of 2 new formats, XAVC-S and H.265/HEVC.  As noted previously, I'm no video editing expert and I don't use these programs often, but from what I can tell, the look and feel has not changed in any significant way.

If you are reading reviews trying to figure out which video editing program you want to get, I would highly recommend one of the flavors of PowerDirector.  Just go to the web site first so you know what it is you are getting (and what you are not) with the version you pick--the name sure as heck ain't gonna' tell ya!"
"I thought I would review my experience with Womens Health and Mens Health magazines.
This is not a perfect magazine. For one, I was a charter subscriber when it first came out. I get the print and iPad / Kindle edition. That has been awhile. While I have gotten older the magazine has stayed stuck at the same age. While I am now in an older demographic that its numbers are huge, it is pretty much ignored now.
Surely I am not the only fifty year old in good shape, or who is interested in being and staying that way. Maybe a mens and women's health plus.
Anyway you get used to that sort of thing. One reviewer said all you need is one year of this magazine and it will cover everything. That could be true sort of, but I like it for the ideas, motivation, and it has some really cool food stuff, and recipes.
I get mens health, and I got womens health for my significant other. The stories and info do not overlap. Most times I find womens health a better magazine. Womens health also suffers from the agest problem. They think their readers don't get older. If they follow their magazines fitness programs they should get older.. right?"
Son loved this!
GREAT!
"I have been using McAfee Internet Security for many years, even for years before Intel bought them.  I have never had a virus or other intrusion when using this McAfee product..  It is also nice to be able to buy one product and protect both my Desktop & Laptop computers.  I am well satisfied with this item."
"I have used quicken for 19 years on various mac computers and currently use this version running on a Macbook Pro dual core running OS Mountain Lion.  However to run the program on OS Lion you must additionally purchase the upgrade for $14.99 from Quicken which you can get from: [...]  From what I have read the Mac version is not as robust as the Windows version, so Windows converts may instead want to consider running the Windows version on bootcamp."
"While TurboTax does indeed have the best interface, it can be glitchy and frustrating.

It has never been good about importing, and this year was no different. I use two big investment firms, and TurboTax could not successfully import either one. Since that's one of the reasons I purchase this particular software, I cannot recommend this product.

If you have a simple return, this software will work well--but you'll pay a lot. Anything slightly complicated seems to throw Intuit."
"The intuit TurboTax Home & Business 2014 Federal, State Personal and Small Business tax software that is E-File ready.  If you have a small business and personal taxes that need to be filed then you'll want to give this one a test drive.  Tired of having to rush everything within two days of April 15th?  Well, this software will get you ready way before then so you'll be ready for Uncle Sam when he comes a calling.  It's easy to use and all you have to do is follow the onscreen instructions and have your W-2s along with your business records on hand.

If you need a helping hand with your taxes for 2014 then you will want to purchase  TurboTax Home & Business 2014 State, Federal E-File software.  Filing your taxes this season will be easy as pie."
"I didn't have any major problems installing this software.  The only problem I had was a few components didn't quite load correctly upon startup, but a reboot fixed the problem.  I had NIS 2003 and was very happy with it; this new version really doesn't seem to offer a lot of exciting new features, seems merely the same as 2003 dressed-up to look like a new version.  Anyhow, this software is working fine and no problems since I installed it two weeks ago.  I give it 4-stars only because the installation process - or rather problems that may surface during the installation process - can be frustrating to the average computer user.  If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.  Can't get easier than that!"
"It is a minimal protection for any ONE device, not unlimited as it says above. I thought this would be great, as I have quite a few devices I need to cover, so when offered this item from the vine program, I jumped on it. However, the item I received was for just a single device, so I infact just put it on my least expensive laptop that I use occasionally, no problems, but no great excitement of security either."
"The economist is one of the best magazines available today. The economist has been able to improve the quality of the magazine by charging subscribers more in order to cover the costs of sending journalists out to research, and report.

I read the magazine from cover to cover, and find the articles interesting, well researched, and backed up with extensive analysis and data. It took me a while to get adjusted to The Economist. This magazine includes comprehensive coverage into the economic and political events that impact this world. The economist features extensive coverage into events in Europe.

Pros
- Quality journalism
- Interesting Articles
- Data/Analytics
- Global Viewpoint

Cons
- Expensive
- Look elsewhere if you needs tips about stocks
- Coverage focuses on Europe"
I've been using this software for years and I love it.  It's simple and it just works.
"Works like any other gift card. Got it, it worked."
"A lot of products currently are coming with the option to install extra junk automatically selected.  I assume most people know to deselect this junk before installation so I'm not knocking off any rating for the junk that Nero would like to give you.

Nero 2014 packs a lot of products into this single collection.  This can make it difficult to find the functionality that you want.  For example I figured I'd try recoding a CD to MP3s to play on my portable player, you'd think ""Nero Recode"" would do this task.  No, it doesn't, ""Recode"" says it doesn't recognize any of the files on the CD.  I managed to find under Nero Express a tab for the ""extended area"" where I found ""Save Audio Tracks"" which does this process.  There is a long hesitation as it loads the dialog box, which I assume is it going out and querying the Internet for the track name data (no option to skip this check).  People who like simplicity might like Nero as it doesn't allow you to get into all the fine details of MP3 settings (you just select from a list of 19 preset options) but people looking for a power tool may be disappointed.

The Video product worked okay.  This is one of the few products I've found which can easily and without fuss read the VOB files on DVDs (no, it doesn't break copyrighted DVDs) but it is slow (as are most tools dealing with huge amounts of video data) and unresponsive at times (if you trigger it to do something there is often no way to cancel so you just have to sit and wait unless you wish to crash the program).

Once you are familiar with it, Nero should get the job done like it always has, but the first few times using it, you'll likely be stumbling around."
"really like reading People Style Watch, while I can't usually afford the items in the magazine. It does give it me great ideas on new trends and fashions I should be trying. I love reading fashion and gossip magazines and this gives me the best of celebrity styles and trends."
"Disclaimer: I am not a tax expert and do not claim to be one. However, I believe this ""standard"" edition of TurboTax that I have been asked to review has filed my taxes incorrectly.

Last year, I was unemployed and the IRS offers so called free filing through various companies if your income is below a certain limit so I tried the free version TurboTax offered through the IRS.  When I told them I had a HSA, suddenly I was no longer able to file taxes through TurboTax even though I met the income limit.  A HSA is nothing complex, it's a savings account for healthcare expenses, but suddenly I no longer qualified for free filing. Instead, they tried to upsell me to an expensive version.  This seems like a scam.

This year, I elected to review this retail version of Turbotax and the question of whether or not I had a HSA was not mentioned at all.  Fine, maybe laws changed because of the ACA and HSA's no longer matter.  TurboTax wanted to charge an extra $39 to file taxes for my state which I declined.

For no particular reason, I decided to look through a tax booklet (not included with TurboTax) and it seems I was supposed to include a Form 8889 with my taxes to show if I had deposited or withdrawn money from my HSA.  Because of this I believe TurboTax filed my taxes incorrectly, and I will need to go through the hassle of making corrections to my return.

Looking at the back of the TurboTax box, there are four (!) different versions to buy but there is nothing saying which version you should use if you have a HSA. So being unable to find the correct version of Turbotax to fit your needs may cause your taxes to be filed incorrectly.  This product claims to be able to file a 1040A which I normally use, but the truth is, it's only good for a 1040EZ and anyone should be able to file a 1040EZ on their own.

As a result, I don't recommend you use this product and I will not use it in the future."
"So comfortable, I don't even feel like I have a sneaker on. Based on the other reviews I got a half a size up and glad I did."
"Work very well, but slows down the PC."
"I had to practice with this product a little before I felt good about the results. It can be sticky and make my hair feel greasy if I use too much, so I have to be careful. If I don't use enough, then it doesnt' really do anything. After I used it a few times, I felt like I had learned the best way to use it for my thin hair and make it look fuller and thicker. Unfortunately, there isn't a lot of whip in the small jar, so I wasted quite a bit practicing with it. I'll definitely buy another jar, though, because I like the results. It's not something I plan to use every day, but it will help me feel good about my hairstyle when I want it to look nice and full."
"Unhappy - installed this and after 10 more days of business as usual my system was infected with the ICE virus, requiring me to completely erase my system, files, and all memory after the PC was new and start all over again.  Kinda thought the purpose of this was to prevent viruses and after 5 years of Micro protection I think I'll be searching for a new provided."
"It is what it says it is, a gift card to Sephora. No problems using the card. Giving it 5 stars seems kind of silly, but I don't know that it would be fair to give it anything less."

If you are interested in items like the Nissan Actic Concept Car (that has a matching trailer) or you want to discover new modern options for your bathroom, kitchen or garden, this magazine delivers.

DWELL has a variety of articles to interest the casual decorator or the seriously focused chef. For example, the April/May 2004 issue had articles on:

Home Cooking - a contractor and his three sons design a home with the kitchen at the heart of the home.

Cutting It Up - A downtown Los Angeles loft gets a makeover.

Stainless Chef - Designer John Picard finds a sanctuary with a high-tech steam oven and a hand-carved tub.

Victorian Revival - A San Franscico couple is the inspiration for a dramatic culinary renovations.

Trend Diva - Jane Szita talks about nesting and nihilism.

Other interesting articles include information on houses that become art, short reviews for books on subjects such as living in a small space.

I was intrigued by the house designed with mostly windows on page 45 and high tech enthusiasts will also love features for speakers or CD changers which are most modern.

Well, until I can afford a 9,500 buck oven, I'll keep reading and dreaming. The library in the April/May issue is to die for! Big windows and shelves galore.

Dwell is a magazine designed to inspire and inspire it did! Even some of the text is in color. The Marketplace section gives you a wealth of sources to encourage you to start on your own dream design, house or otherwise. The sourcing section also provides page by page information on sources.

"Painter 11 is impressive, but requires an impressive amount of learning to get up to speed with the program.

The installation was easy on my older (3+ years) WinXP desktop system with 2gb of ram memory. Painter runs fine on my system with minor delays on occasion, mostly during autopainting related steps. It has crashed a few times when I seemed to get way out in left field trying new things in a rushed manner but I was able to restart the program and continue on easy enough.

Based on my prior experience with photo related software (Photoshop CS3, Nikon Capture NX2, etc.) I feel that Painter 11 is a solid and well heeled painterly specific product that is very close to Photoshop in software quality, features (toolkit) based on primary purpose, and usability. I would have rated Painter equal to Photoshop CS3 in software quality but CS3 has never crashed on me.

At first I got stuck because I didn't have a workflow to follow, but after watching some tutorials I made great progress and enjoyed the journey. I highly recommend John Derry's Workflow Tutorials at Corel's website under resources and then follow his lead.

I also bought Karen Sperling's Painting for Photographers ebook that has step-by-step instructions tailored for Corel Painter. It is easy to follow and you also get some relevant painting theory and practices which were very helpful. Her software mastery with Corel Painter is impressive and her ability to teach me made the tutorial worth every penny spent.

The Corel Painter 11 supplied User Guide under the Help menu was useful also.

After learning the essentials of navigating around in the program and its myriad of features, with much thanks to the tutorials I used, I can see why a master artist would use and rely on this program to transform photos into digital paintings of the highest quality.

I have found the progression of steps from beginning photo to finished painterly art is quite logical for image editing software. There is support for non-destructive layers, cloning, underpainting, tracing, dodging, burning, rubber stamping, along with a huge assortment of customizable brushes, chalks, pencils, etc., and artistic effects. It will be a long time before I exhaust the possibilities presented to me in this software.

I like the auto painting underpainting feature with color scheme selections as I can get well into the painting process quickly and the results are much better than other programs I have tried. Underpainting's Smart Blur set to 100% was impressive. The tracing feature is very nice because I can paint intelligently with the original photo ""underneath"" at a lesser opacity as my guide and then quickly flip back and forth between the painting and the original photo to see my progress.

I was originally drawn to Corel Painter because some of the masters use this tool quite successfully and it is recommended often in painterly forum discussions. I was not disappointed by following their lead."
"This is a good program for the following tasks, which includes:  Creating a card, calendar, photobook, a slideshow, photobook and even a disc back-up.  This program has the ability to fix the red-eye and crop a photo.  It also can upload a photo to Facebook, Flickr and other websites.  While it is not as in-depth as other similar programs, it is fairly simple to use and has a friendly interface which will be suitable for most users."
"But I don't care for the way Intuit forces you to upgrade if you want to continue downloading transactions from financial institutions.  Another thing is this version shortens the downloaded payee field and puts the full text of the payee in the memo field.  There may be a logical reason for this but I don't know what it is.  I liked version 2011, but alas, I had to upgrade."
"I have used Trend Micro for several years. Have also used Norton, Kaspersky, and McAfee all with good results. We have multiple computers in our home and in recent years have been converting to Linux Ubuntu Distro which necissitates not having this type of anti virus control. On Windows 7 and Vista computers that we have all of these programs are running well and tough to pick one over another. Each have their characteristics on updates and excluding various programs. Some are limited in storage and require additional purchases. Was glad to get the Trend Micro Titanium and can reccomend it as a good solid anti virus program. Catches most Malware consistently."
"I tried this software out in several languages, and found the learning process to be very easy and intuitive.  I'd recommend it for learning a language, although it will never compare to living in a foreign country and speaking only that language.

Pros:
Rosetta stone's process is a lot better than traditional ""current language word = foreign language word"" learning processes, which rely on memorization and lead to internal translation from the foreign language to one's native language while speaking.  Rosetta stone converts foreign words straight to pictures and ideas, eliminating internal translation to one's native language.  There is plenty of repetition of previous words, but at no point does the process seem like rote recitation.

The software is divided into ""lessons"" which introduce new words, and have several exercises including matching, pronouncing each part of the word, verbally filling in blanks with your new words, etc.  There is plenty to keep you interested and ensure that you learn new words and phrases.

The voice recognition was decent, a simple training has the program hearing you correctly ~90% of the time, and an adjustable slider can reduce the pickiness the software has if you're having issues, although that also controls how strictly you want to be held to pronunciation.

Cons of Rosetta Stone:
-Higher price
-The approach in rosetta stone does not use conjugations or grammar rules, you just learn words and phrases.  Some maybe bothered by this.
-Many other reviews note technical problems, I had no issues on my PC running windows XP."
"This magazine has its good and bad issues which happen every month so it's hard to grade. I do like the new ""work"" feature they added though. Especially November 2012 article regarding taking a leadership role in the workplace."
"I agree with other comments about the significant price increase that H&R put forth this year. I've used TaxCut for several years now, ever since Intuit tried to put some copy protection on their similar tax product a few years back. My sense is that both TurboTax and TaxCut are neck and neck, and for most of us, neither has a significant advantage over the other. Both products, regrettably, require me to proceed through my tax return in a particular order and not jump around to partially complete different parts of my return as I retrieve information.

My return is really pretty simple and, based on the jump in prices this year, I'm thinking that it is time to revert to completing my return on the IRS forms this year and mailing them in. It's just not worth $60 for the privilege of completing my return in their step-by-step approach."
"I like subway, who doesn't? these will make good gifts for my friends!"
"Download was very fast over my 50/25mbps network. I use an external drive for system backup, so a physical CD was not required. I use this software to track tenant expenses and incomes on two properties; data can then be imported to TurboTax software for easy filing."
"The free OpenOffice suite has reached amazing levels of quality and feature sets. It may not offer all the bells and whistles you can find in the Microsoft products, but it's solid, reliable software with excellent compatibility with the MS Office standard. You will not have any problems exchanging most Word or Excel documents, and it's more than most students will ever need.
In a business environment, exchanging documents that are heavily formatted and contain graphics is not 100% painless though. If you must collaborate with Microsoft Office users on this type of document, make sure you run a few tests before switching.
Still, this is superb, feature-laden, reliable software that offers more than most people need at an unbeatable price -- and there's no catch. No ad banners, no subscription, no nagging dialogs... Everyone should install this suite."
Purchased for a gift for my parents.  Convenient and cheap since its 10 off.
As advertised.
No issues. Good deal.
"Use this product every year, just need to watch for price drops to save. Never looked back at turbo Tax after 2 years of problems."
"easy to use ,very friendly and reviews all the things you should be deducting."
Buy it and immediately an advertisement come up to buy the pro version. It does not really work that well at all. If possible try to find another program that can do more for the same price. I will.
"this is fun, and our whole family got to be involved. it is easy to do to. what i liked is figuring out people on your tree and places you never even thought of."
Great decorating ideas
Buying this product leaves you feeling cheated because one is compelled to upgrade to this product because Turbox crippled the functionality of its Deluxe product
"This product is pretty innovative as it is installed via USB and not cd rom. Keep in mind, to try this product, you must uninstall all other security software. I tried it on a separate laptop in case I wasn't happy with it. The one major thing I liked was that when it was scanning, it didn't affect the other processes in the same way that macafee causes a slow down or momentary freezing of what you're working on otherwise. I think it will be a matter of living with this software for a while before making a final decision on its overall effectiveness and how the renewal process works. In researching, I've noticed that there have been complaints about the product not functioning if it isn't renewed at exactly the due date. I don't know if this is true but it's worth mentioning. I have it marked on my calendar to see when the year is up. Otherwise, it seems to be a good, innovative product with possibilities. As with anything new on the market, time does have a way of showing the glitches and hopefully, the creators will be constantly upgrading the software to move ahead with the times.

I will try to edit my review over time with updates or oddities with the product until the renewal date when I will make a decision whether or not to renew."
Great gifts
"I've used PowerDVD since it came installed on my next-to-last computer. It's a solid all-around media player and the Ultra version will play just about anything I can throw at it. It's not all that complicated to learn to use and the TrueTheater technology does a good job with HD upscaling.

Over time, the amount of content I stream has increased and I use PowerDVD less and less. The only reason I still use it, to be honest, is for watching Blur-Ray discs. It handles them well, but if you're not into Blu-Rays, go with a ""lower"" version of this software (it'll save you bucks) or cobble together a suite of free apps that'll handle all the usual suspects/file types.

I'm disappointed Cyberlink includes ""junkware"" (additional and useless software) in the install. That's ridiculous. I can see why free apps try to install superfluous software, but an app I've paid for? Please."
Good product for the price.  Used very day and no problem.

"The best tax software on the market, bar none.  I use it every year, and get my maximum refund (or lowest tax bill) with the confidence that all is accurate and soundly acceptable."
"OK, it does what I bought it for, mostly, eventually.  I got out of the quicken habit many years ago when I didn't upgrade.  My previous experience was that the the software was fine but that intuit was annoying in that they never lost an opportunity to market to me or install unwanted crap on my computer.  Well, my new experience is that they did manage to miss a few annoyance opportunities but have addressed those problems.  I wish they had paid as much attention to shipping a better product.

Seriously, this version is slower than the one I used in 1996 and that was on a computer from that era - about 250 times slower and smaller than my current one.  The new quicken doesn't download account data any better or faster in spite of the broadband versus the old modem connection.  It's still doing the slow agonizing one account after another thing too.  The user interface feels positively sluggish.  Note, this is on a brand new laptop that is otherwise fine.

Having run software organizations, my suspicion is that quicken is a legacy product that no one at Intuit is comfortable programing anymore.  They do their best to adapt to new versions of windows, but that appears to be about all.  Other than that, they bandage what they must to keep this cash cow a-milking.  They probably don't even have a product engineering team in place anymore.  Nothin' there but marketing folks and a product manager pairing up phone support contracts with the cheapest possible suppliers.  They will however, find new and innovative ways to market to us.

Good for them, they have a monopoly and are willing to use it.

Hmmm, this market is starving for a competitive product ..."
everyone loved getting them for Christmas  Thanks
"I've used Nero for a decade now and will probably continue to do so, but I more and more find it to be difficult to use. It does more than it used to, but for the most part I don't want to do most of the things it alleges it is capable of. It seems to be less intuitive than it used to be. And it still has some irritating features, like not blowing past disc protection. Let's face it, a lot of times you want a copy of a disc for completely legal reasons, such as a gaming disc that you will use as the playing copy.

So I will use this, but so far I am not as enamored of it as I was of its predecessors"
You can get the bundle discount on digital downloads of Quicken and Turbo Tax even though the purchase of digital software does not go through the cart and are paid for one at a time.  After phoning customer support I first purchased Turbo Tax and then purchased Quicken.  At the point it asked for payment on the second product it also showed the $35 discount.  So it did actually work :-)
"This foot file is good as a finishing, smoothing touch after heavy duty foot scrubber. Just by itself it won't take care of calluses."
"I have always loved Country Living and it has never disappointed me.  If you are a newbie, then try it.  It's friendly and filled with great ideas.  You'll love it."
I'm a fan!
"So far I am having fun with this software.  Great product.  I have learned some about taking pictures from it.  Highly underexposed photo don,t seem to be able to be imporved by much.  Over exposed photos work great with this software.  Removing unwanted background is easy and lots of fun.  Removing glases sun light or light bulb glare is also easy, fun and impresive.  Red eye clean up is the best. The only problem I have had is registering.  Two phone calls and two emails and I finally got it registered.  Yeaaaaa.
 When touring sometimes I am taking pic into or near the sun.  Sometimes I am taking pic through the window.  These photos don,t come out to good until I use this software.  They clean up pretty well."
"I do not recommend the Windows 8 upgrade because :

(1) Before upgrading to Windows 8, it is recommended that you download and run the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant.
It scans your computer to provide a compatibility report etc. There are different versions of windows 8, like
RT(on PDA and tablets), 32 bit, 64 bit etc.

(2)You may have to spend money to upgrade your computer's components to meet the minimum requirements to run Windows 8.
  (a) 1 GHz or faster processor with support for PAE, NX, and SSE2
  (b) 1 GB (32-bit) or 2 GB (64-bit) RAM
  (c) 16 GB (32-bit) or 20 GB (64-bit) hard drive
  (d) DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM driver
  (e) Screen or monitor that supports multitouch to use the touchscreen features.

 You may also have to download and install new drivers for different components. It is easier and usually less expensive to buy a new computer with Windows 8 installed, for around $250, than to upgrade different components and software.

(3) Too many bugs in Windows 8, leading to too many and too often updates, over 110. My computer is downloading and installing updates every few days. Imagine you boot up to try to use software ZZZ, but the screen says it is checking for, downloading, installing, configuring updates and restarting, the hard drive is spinning, you can not do anything but wait for it to finish. It can be 30 minutes to almost 2 hours. I am disgusted and turn auto-update off.

(4) Parts of many software that run on Windows older than 8, may not run properly on Windows 8. Many software simply do not run on Windows 8 RT and Windows 8 64 bit. That means you must spend more money to upgrade to the latest versions of application software, assuming they will run in Windows 8 without problems. Adobe Flash Player 11.8 crashes in Windows 8, but not version 10.3.

(5) The new internet explorer on the tiled Start Screen is full of bugs. You encounter disappearing address bar, screens, sudden zoom in, zoom out etc. I end up using the old x86 internet explorer (32 bit) on desktop, or Firefox. Many software included with Windows 8 like Internet Explorer, Paint, Wordpad etc are full of bugs and exclude nice options like ""Undo"", available in older versions of the same software. The new Paint does not have options like ""Undo"", ""reverse color"", attributes (size the image to fit on paper), etc.

(6) I am a computer programmer. I notice some of the menu choices do nothing when clicked on. In the past, I have been told to put a lot of menu choices or options on the screen even though the codes to execute those options are not included because they have not been written or do not work as yet. Many companies do that to mislead consumers into believing that their software can do many more tasks than they actually can.

(7) To shut the computer down or restart, you have to move the cursor to top right edge of screen. Click on settings bar on right when it appears. click on Power when it appears. Click on shut down when it appears. That involves 4 steps. It also takes longer to shut down.

(8) Devices that work with older versions of Windows (XP, Vista,7) may not work properly with Windows 8, causing freeze ups, non-recognition etc.

(9) Parts of many websites like [...] webmd.com have frozen up, did not work and so on. This happens whether you are using Firefox, Internet Explorer or other browsers.

(10) Need at least a few weeks, to learn to do the same things in new ways etc.

(11) Wait until year 2015 or after to buy, give Microsoft, software and device manufactures time to fix the bugs and update the drivers for Windows 8.

It takes time to research these information.

"I've always gotten this size in Nike shoes with similar description, but these are too long- at least an inch and 1/2."
Have used this product for several years now.  Transfers of previous tax year date is accomplished.  The program is sophisticated enough to do corporate taxes w/o being difficult to use.  Tech support is also good.
"I bought the 06 version and loved it.
I downloaded the trial version for 08 to see if it is worth the new price, afterall, I bought the 06 just not so long ago (maybe less than 3 months).
The new Numbers and Pages are just wonderful.  It is so much more intuitive than MS Office.  I have the Office for Mac and I have been using Office in Windows for the past 10 years.  But ever since I started using Pages and Keynote, and now Numbers, I have to say hands down, iWork 08 is near perfection for 99.9% of all office needs.
I wish there were even more templates for all three apps.  But with the included templates, one could modify them to create new templates fairly easy and quick.
My trial period is coming to an end in a couple of weeks.  I will buy the iWork 08 for sure."
"Immediately got C++ runtime errors.  Need to go to Corel website and download latest version Pro x5 service pack 3!  Amamzon should state that it is only a 32 bit programs, therefore it runs slow, Windows 8 is 64 bit.  They immediately hit you up with an upgrade for PSP X6 for $60-70, which runs th 64 bit program."
"Buy this for my aunt.  She loves the fragrance so when I was ordering it for her, I noticed the gel.  Now she is a regular user."
"As someone who has experimented with (and truly disliked) QuickBooks, I can honestly say that this Sage software is incalculably better. It is a breeze to install, ""bug"" free (as far as I can, thus far, determine), and completely intuitive. The buyer need not have a M.B.A. in order to successfully navigate and use this product. You merely need a basic understanding of accounting (really, just the fundamentals) and this Sage program will easily guide you through the rest.

This is a boon for small businesses! Do not hesitate to purchase this! It made all the difference to us!"
great
Like all new versions of Windows it will take some time to learn how to use it. I am useing it on a desktop computer will work better with a touch screen I am sure.
My old one failed to work after continuously working for 4 years.  Unfortunately the company behind this product can no longer be found.  Luckily I found this one as a replacement.
Got refund.
"Better than the cloud reader, not as good as it was years ago.  Kinda disappointed, so the rating reflects that.  Works in Win8, 10, 7, XP.  I didn't test it for Linux."
"Works ok on Mac. As other reviewers have stated elsewhere the windows version works smoother and this version is not as robust as the one it replaces. That being said it does what it is supposed to but.... the days of the Microsoft Office being a needed program are fading fast. With open office and the word processor already on Mac (pages) along with open office and of course google docs I can see the day when they will hardly be able to give Microsoft Office away. Pages does the just about the same thing cheaper and Pages is the one I use most,"
"This does not work well with Windows 10. After installing this software, my icons on desktop and folders kept on flickering continuously. Only after uninstalling the software would it stop."
"I have loved WordPerfect for many years highschool/college/work. The sofware is extremely use freindly and very versatile. Word is good-Word Perfect is great handles many more formats great for people with old files, has the same old great features with quite a few new ones. Easy installation on several Pc's I would be suprise if it did not become your go to program."
"This little USB/Firewire Hub is tops.  Lots of ports, and it works like a charm.

This is one great product for the price."
I installed this and copied the backup files from Quicken 2006 into it.  The simple functions work as well as Quicken 2006.  I have not tried any of the on-line functions.  I buy the new version every time I buy a new laptop.
"This is a review of WordPerfect Office X8, Home and Student Edition

While there are one or two nice improvements added, Corel has not added a remarkable improvement since they bought the rights to WordPerfect in 1996&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-Wordperfect-Suite-8-Professional/dp/B001DWKH66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel Wordperfect Suite 8 Professional</a>. Those comfortable with MS Word, Excel or OneNote should  examine the benefits versus the drawbacks of using WordPerfect and Quattro Pro as  primary applications. Version X8 is stable, lightweight and less resource-hungry than Libreoffice. I found it to be slightly more responsive than Some of the Office 365 apps like Word and OneNote. I have not had reliable success converting Word or Excel documents to either Wordperfect or Quattro Pro. Quattro Pro interprets formulae and functions in its own way so excel users may have to relearn everything. On the other hand, Wordperfect is a stable program . Three stars because this version has few additional features and has not really changed much. What does Corel say?

Here's what Corel claims is ""new"" and worth the price:

1). 3 Templates (one each) for formatting a document in APA, MLA or University of Chicago format. These are available in the Perfect Expert application and must be downloaded before using them.
2). ""Enhanced reveal codes"" adds an additional button to the WordPerfect Toolbar and the ability to display the codes panel on either the right, left or bottom of the text editing window.
3). ""Enhanced Undo"" allows a user to  reverse up to 100 (10 default setting) previous actions including undeleting text or reversing a hard return.
4) Configure specific hotkeys and keyboard shortcuts for your own use/preference.
5).""Template Preview"" allows a user to see a thumbnail image of a finished template in the create new template menu box (File=>New from Template).

Of these features, only the APA/MLA templates and the ability to move the codes dock are new in this version of the Suite. The actual functionality of reveal codes remains the same as in previous versions. Moving the codes window from bottom to either side is a hassle when writing.

I do like this upgrade and would definitely say it is worth a look (but probably not a ""buy""). It is good for me. Users of Microsoft Office and other modern suites should be careful before jumping in and buying the product. The following are some slightly negative aspects of WordPerfect X8 Home and Student (may not apply to the professional edition):

1). No PDF or Legal functionalities. A document may be printed to PDF (as in any other program such as notepad, wordpad) but there is no way to import a PDF.
2). Collaboration features consist of importing a file to WPD, comparing the document to another imported document and then exporting both documents back to the original format to be sent back to their original source. Another painful hassle.
3). No features for direct collaboration with Word, Kingsoft or Google Docs/Drive (direct collaboration only available for other Wordperfect users/document)
4). No mail/calendar feature.
5). No support for MacOS.
6). Cannot directly view or edit an HTML document or interpret XML code for editing (without compiling a specific Document Type Definition and creating a new template specifically for that XML type)
7). Only two legal templates (one memo and one numbered sheet) and one project template for creating a legal time sheet.
8). The reveal codes pane is very unattractive in ""Classic mode"" (WP DOS mode) and makes for a very cluttered screen.
9). Word and LibreOffice formats do not convert accurately. Basically, you can destroy an entire Word or Libreoffice manuscript by converting it to Wordperfect and/or converting it back again.
10). Customizers will spend hours with the XML project designer just to get basic work done
10). No eBook formatting.
11). No cloud-based version of the programs, cloud storage and syncing or blogging features.
12). No support for 64-bit processors.

I recommend this release for long-time or established users of WordPerfect but would not recommend it to users most familiar with application suites like Word, Excel, Outlook/Kingsoft Office/LibreOffice. Conversion to Word and odt (LibreOffice) is fair to poor and the conversion/import process has the tendency to mangle formatting and add extra characters and symbols to formatted lists, text with headings and even basic formatting like a 5-space indent or italicized or bold  text. In long documents it is very difficult to hunt down all of the extra characters and errant formatting and to correct each instance of a conversion error.

I totally understand the religious following of this product and I understand the feelings, but everything gets down to ""Do you want workable skills for a job?"" If the answer is no, the fiddling with Wordperfect and Quattro may be for you.

I am presently using WordPerfect X8 Home and Student for my daily work on Windows 10.  I do like Lightning (notetaking app). Home and casual users may find WordPerfectX8 interesting for the attractive new program icons (a blue circle for WP and a green circle for Quattro) and some of the new templates.
The Brainstorm mini-tutorials are fun and entertaining but not really crucial for production purposes."
"I am very familiar with the older version of PowerDVD and my review is based upon comparison in both versions.

This media player supports the playback of Blu-ray 3D discs, Blu-ray discs, DVDs, and most video/audio formats.

Uses 2 modes :

Classic
Cinema : view movies at a distance with remote control

New in this version:

Uses Tabs: Quickly change to movies, videos, music, photo slide shows,and media on external devices

Photo  : View photos in 2D , 3D or slide show. Convert 2D photos into 3D

Devices  : Play videos, photo slide shows and music files from iphone, ipad and Android devices wirelessly. Play protected content from mediaservers over DTCP-IP Stream or download from DLNA home.

Social Media : Upload videos to YouTube or watch YouTube videos. Convert 2D into 3D videos and upload to YouTube3D. Upload, download & view photos on Facebook and Flickr.

PowerDVD Remote : The smart device app turns your iphone, ipad or Android into a Power DVD remote control.

This new version of CyberLink PowerDVD has much more abilities than the old version. They've advanced the software greatly and it's quite impressive.

The greatest new feature is the remote control ability.

This is a product with much variation in uses and I'd recommend it very highly."
i love it
"This is a fairly efficient and secure method of sending large documents but, unless you are going to use it profusely, it is way overpriced."
"I've owned several ""home designer"" software suites and this is the most capable.  I'm not a designer nor am I an architect but I do like to try out home remodeling projects ""on paper"" before starting them, and I have always been fascinated with home design. This is not a cheap toy version of home design software, it is capable enough to actually be used by pro designers and architects.

One of the thinks I like is that the software helps me visualize a concept the way I think, not as a computer programmer. Every element I can think of is there at my disposal. I can keep a concept simple or take it to the point of pre-construction and make my mistakes BEFORE I actually start building.

Unlike other designer software I have used, this one is not a memory hog. It works fine on an average computer and the graphics look great. It has been a great assistance to me for several current projects (yard, guest bath, kitchen, fireplace, den) that are all in their early stages of remodeling.

The price may be a little high if you're not a serious designer, but that is a matter of personal opinion."
"I breeze through it to look for any plain boring stuff they might have (not very often).  My wife likes to look at the desserts.  This was purchased for us as a gift and we renewed once, so it peaked our interest enough to do that.  Its a good magazine for the break room or the bathroom."
"I purchased another TurboTax&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TurboTax-Deluxe-Federal-State-eFile-2008/dp/B001GL6QHS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TurboTax Deluxe Federal + State + eFile 2008</a>&nbsp;from Amazon for $49.99 with five free federal e-filings and FREE state download (only one state downloaded free, 2nd different state download cost $$).  You still have to pay $19.99 per state tax return you e-file.  When I finished my sixth tax return (I was wrong and thought it offered six free federal e-filings), I went through the process, paid the state e-filing fee only to be informed that I had reached the limit.  TurboTax downloaded another one for me, but I couldn't transfer the tax data I had already filled out, and I couldn't import it to their online returns since it was 2008 data.  TurboTax said I would have to buy another version and do the sixth tax return all over on another computer.  I couldn't use my free MD state download or my paid Missouri state download since I had to do it on another computer.

So I purchased this one just to do one tax return and discovered that downloading one state cost $39.99.  Since I had already printed out the Missouri state return from my computer, I skimped and only downloaded MD state return and will paper file the Missouri one.  I still had one unused state e-filing on my previous TurboTax but was told that the two go hand in hand, so you have to e-file the same federal & state, you can't use an unfiled state e-file on another return.

Bottom line is that original version I purchased (see above link) with the free state is now around $41.  This one cost $34.39 + $39.99 for one state = $74.38.  Crazy prices - I wish I had purchased the $41 w/free state download and saved myself some bucks!

Also, since there are five people in my home (only 2 returns as yet though) and friends asked me to do their return, TurboTax should have flexibility so that if you exceed the five limit, you can reload more and not have to pay all over again for another software package, another 2nd state download etc.  I am going to suggest this to them for next year."
"Not quite as high quality as the Travel and Leisure of years gone by,but then what is. Still has lots of travel info and stories on great places. A lot more ads than I remember. Good photography."
wife loved it
Very high quality product. I had difficulty finding something without paraben etc. that can actually hold my son's faux hawk all day - until now. This stuff is fantastic - just wish it weren't so expensive.
"I love my 2100 Navigon. (Read my review on the same). I loved it so much when it got destroyed I went and bought a 2nd. Navigon. You may buy a 2nd. navigon due to various reasons - like my case, just for upgrading to newer model, vandalism (more & more happening now), etc. So here I am, with just 2 downloads from possible 12 and I try to register my FreshMaps subscription service -- REPEAT NAVIGON SAYS IT'S A SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE for my new Navigon - 2200T. Nada,zilch, zero, null. Customer service: NO, YOU NEED TO BUY NOW A NEW SUBSCRIPTION, NEW FRESH MAPS, etc. etc. I tell them - where it's written in their terms & conditions - it's not transferable. No Sir - not written, it's ASSUMED. It's our Company policy, etc. That's PURE VANILLA DECEPTIVE MARKETING and also absolutely foolish strategy. Why? I returned back my 2200T, went to Craigslist.org ; bought myself a nice USED 2100 and I continue to happily and merrily use my FreshMaps subscription!! So, ALL YOU GOOD FOLKS - remember - if you buy this you're locking yourself into Navigon's product for the lifetime of the subscription. This includes TRAFFIC, ZAGAT, everthing. I just thought all should be made aware of this limitation."
"I have been using SM for nearly 5 years now. I first purchased it when my primary computer began acting sluggish -- it was in need of maintenance but I had no idea what. For me, SM was a god-send ... it breathed new life into an aging machine and allowed me to keep it up and running for 4 more years. I love the product so much that I've used the trial version on my elder parents' machines. I also use it on my DH's machine ... and he's an IT professional. I now have new machine, and one of my first installs was ... you guessed it, SM 9 for Win7.

That said, some words of advice when using SM.

--> Back-up your registry & system before the first install.
--> Check online for updates, especially after the first install.
--> Always, always, always back-up your system & registry before any major changes to you computer, including the ones that SM makes/suggests.
--> Don't use Active Care. Instead, use the individual tools or tool groups.
--> Make changes incrementally. Reboot after making a change & re-analyze for recommendations. Evaluate.
--> Before you make a change, do some research and understand a bit about what the change/fix is. Just because a program suggests a change/fix, doesn't mean that you should make it.
--> SM Standard is probably sufficient. I've previously owned SM Pro and never used the additional features. However, SM Pro is non-subscription pricing but SM Standard is yearly subscription (at least as of the last I checked).
--> Price the SM 3-PC license versions. I've found this to be one of the best values -- only problem, the clock on all the licenses starts ticking on the first install & activation.

That said, SM is a great all-in-one maintenance utility -- it's a worthwhile investment in your computer, and it just might improve your knowledge about PCs. That's what it's done for me.

Highly recommended!"
"I'm in the process of updating a will, so was looking forward to using this as a starting point, leaving only the final review to my attorney.

In practice, I found it impossible to get what I wanted that way. Instead, I ended up just manually editing my existing will with a word processor.

If you've never created a will, living will, or durable power of attorney, this software gives you a starting point for your thinking, and helps make sure you don't skip important steps.

However, don't expect your attorney to thank you. Several attorneys I know went out of their way at a recent estate workshop I helped pilot at our church to tell me this is a waste of time, and wouldn't help them meet my needs more efficiently at all. I realize this could be seen as just protecting their turf, but at least one is a good enough friend that I know it's his honest opinion."
great gifts
Love them!
Windows 7 was purchased to repair a failing operating system.
"Love or hate it, I have always found Turbo Tax to be easy to use and covers everything I need for preparing my taxes.  Much cheaper than HRB."
"This is truly fine soap, and lathers as expected. It has not caused irritation on any user in our circle. The scent is very strong--one expects a slice of Key lime pie in the offing, and it does linger."
"Let me just say right up front that I'm not a power user of software such as this.  I've been taking photos both casually and semi-professionally for thirty years, but I usually just take or leave whatever the camera produces.

Just to illustrate, when I installed this software I was surprised to realize I already owned both v. 1 and v. 2!

First, the bad: The installation was archaic.  It installs like you'd expect software from ten years ago.  This blew me away.  There is nothing automated in how you install.  You have to search for the source file, unzip it, etc.  Second, they still haven't changed or improved the interface.  v. 2 and v. 3 are almost identical.  And just like the installation process, it's archaic.  This is not how user friendly modern software behaves.

Now the good, at least for me and my specific needs and uses:

As someone who started out in B&W 35mm photography I've found digital results severely lacking. I own a Nikon D90 and it can shoot better color photos in low light like no film camera ever made.  But B&W, without software manipulation, is a joke.  As a result I've used a Panasonic LX3 for many years in what they call ""dynamic B&W"" mode.  The problem is that the LX3 is lacking in several areas compared with a DSLR or a film camera.  What I've wanted was some software that would allow me to quickly change a color photo to dynamic B&W.  I didn't want to have to learn Photoshop.  Just load, click or two and be done with it.  And THAT is what the newest version of Tiffen DFX does with its new film modes.  I can now return to my D90 and leave the LX3 for those times I need a small camera.

If you're a former user of film cameras and have longed for look and feel you used to get then give this software a serious look.  There are many filters that mimic the appearance you'd get from specific film brands/types, from Agfa to Kodak. Previous versions didn't have the same robust film effects as v. 3 (which is why I forgot I had the earlier versions).  Don't expect Tiffen DFX to feel polished as you use it.  Just use it for what it does.

Even though I'm extremely displeased with the software's interface (I'd take my rating down to a 3 - it's that bad), I realize there are many other types of users besides me with different needs.  So with that in mind, I give this 4 stars.  There's a lot of power here for many different types of users."
"It's been a while since I've use Kaspersky Internet Security, probably about 2 or 3 years. I loved it because it's quiet and ultra-efficient, unlike Norton 360 which is chatty as all get-out, seizing window focus at the most inopportune times. It is also very difficult to work with and modify unlike Kaspersky. Here's an example of what I mean: I do security analysis using some tools that most security suites will cry foul about. Kaspersky alerted and asked what I wanted to do. I added it to the exclude list quickly and intuitively. With Norton, I kept trying to exclude the same security tools and no matter what, it would come screaming back every time it chanced into that folder and found the tools again.
Kaspersky keeps quiet and maintains an amazingly low overhead but it is paying attention. It automatically and smoothly configures the firewall, allowing what it needs to intelligently without bothering you. There's been not one firewall notification that I needed to configure. Scans take place when you want it to and setting it is straightforward, there's no digging involved. It is simple to set up scheduled scans if you like, and it protects everything from IM traffic to email. One of my favorites is the anti-banner, which quickly rids your browser of the ever-present ads seamlessly.
There are other features, such as the Safe Money which automatically senses that you're about to visit a site that will result in transferring financial data. It will ask if you want to fire up a ""safe"" browser--noted by a green halo around the browser--with high-security settings. Of course you're also free to use a normal browser and it will remember your choice.
Truly, Kaspersky is my favorite security suite and I have never regretted using it. 5 stars."
Great read for tech stuff
I couldn't load the program on my MAC.  It's very hard to use if you can't load it.
Perfectly delivered and my son was thrilled!
"Okay so I'm a little excited about this one. ((smile)) I recently had to go through all of my magazine subscriptions and only keep what I truly wanted. The amount of magazines I was getting every month was becoming a fire hazard, but Hey, I'm a Director of Catering and Sales for a Convention Center and I always need new ideas for menus.
This Magazine has EVERYTHING... Places to go, Interesting Articles, Seasonal Gardening Information, How-to for Home repairs/renovations, Mouth watering Recipes.... I mean I could go on for days this Magazine has it ALL!!...
Happy Reading"
"turbo tax is great. work every time. i love it, and have know doubt. thankyou  james................................................."
"Why do I subscribe to this magazine? It is the jack-of-all-trades. It is not too liberal nor too conservative. The analysis is not as deep as ""The Economist"", nor as entertaining as ""People"", nor as educational as ""Scientific American"" or ""Wired"", nor as well written as ""The Atlantic"". In many ways, it is a little of each of those and why I like it. Good news coverage, current, good coverage of entertainment and technology. If you could only have one news magazine but wanted some street-smarts, get this mag. If you want more in-depth news coverage, get ""The Economist""."
"Gourmet magazine has fabulous recipes with an accent on travel, and the flavors of the world. It also tours the U.S., and gives an in depth look at the food typical to a regional area; a recent issue for instance had an article on food in Ireland, and how it has improved through the decades, a guide to Australian wines, quilts and buttermilk biscuits in Appalachia, and a ""Food Lover's Address Book"" in Boston, from burgers near Harvard to spring rolls in Chinatown.
They always have a complete menu, down to the last detail, with beautiful photographs that will inspire you to copy it; ""Quick Kitchen"" with easy to make meals that are also nutritious; ""Kitchen Notebook"", filled with good tips on everything from new products to a better way to slice thin bread, and my favorite feature, ""You Asked for It"", where readers ask for the recipes of dishes they have tasted in restaurants, from Bangkok to Manhattan; Gourmet finds the recipe, tries it out, and shares it with us. Some of the most delicious morsels of the month are on this page.
If one has the time to spend creating these gastronomic delights, it is well worth it. I have never tried a Gourmet recipe that was a disappointment, and there is always something to learn, and much to appreciate visually in every issue."
"I purchased the project for my son who is looking into the field of graphics design.  The program is great with both 2d and 3d access.  The interface seems fairly simple but if you have no experience with a CAD program it is quite daunting.

We did play around with it a bit and made a few simple designs.  I would say it would be a great tool for an engineer or a draftsman but for the Novice you should get Corel Paintshop Pro or a similar graphics program."
"I didn't actually try hacking into the connection, but I assume it does what it says it will do as far as security, but I still won't use it, because it noticeably slowed things down.  Too bad."
Beautiful magazine
"I have some issues with this software.  While I find the Sage 50 Pro Accounting design very intuitive, easy to install and navigate, there are some significant shortfalls.

The software can be unstable. I've used the software for several months, and had to resort to installation repair before opening.  There is also no ability to reconcile bank accounts online, or with any type of transaction download.  I also can't get Sage Accounting to cooperate with Microsoft Outlook.  I did contact technical support regarding this but still could not get the situation resolved.

Due to Microsoft compatibility issues and unstable software problems, I would not recommend this software."
"I was impressed with Dragon NaturallySpeaking 8, but version 9 is  vastly improved in terms of speech recognition. Version 8 was excellent; perhaps in the 95% range. Version 9 comes very close to 100% right out of the box, without any special training.

  Nuance is clear about the product requirements. A processor faster than 1Ghz is required along with at least 1GB of RAM (with 512MB minimum free). At least 650 MB of drive space is required.

  Installation on a computer running Windows XP SP 2 was entirely uneventful. Setting NaturallySpeaking v9 up with two different microphones was a snap. Recognition in a variety of applications was literally 100% without any training. It was, in fact, amazing. Setting the program up to run with a digital voice recorder, however, didn't go so smoothly - and that's why my rating is only 3 stars for what technologically is a 5 star product.

  Nuance's tech support is absolutely awful. They charge $ 9.95 even for an e-mail response, which they call an ""incident."" The manual has virtually no information on troubleshooting. Their online knowledgebase is not well indexed. Or, more accurately, they are running it on a particularly poor platform. Their user community is sparsely used and a lot of the information is useless.

  Nuance should learn that turning out a superior product isn't enough. It has to be supported competently as well and it is here that Nuance falls flat on its face.

  On the other hand, I recognize that the product is working with two microphones and hopefully I will find the answer to my problem somewhere, some day. As a long-time (and long-suffering) voice recognition software user, I will say the accuracy of NaturallySpeaking 9 is phenomenal. Only the support stinks.

"After playing around with my review copy of Pixelmator, that was the question that kept spinning in my mind: ""Yes, it works, but is it worth the money? Would I pay for this, or buy something else?""

I think it depends on what type of user you are.

If you want to do some fun, different effects easily to your pictures, honestly, Pixelmator isn't for you.  Yes, it can do a lot of manipulation, but there is a learning curve, and to really make it fly you're going to invest hours in learning all its ins and outs.  Casual users would be better off sticking with online free or low-cost manipulators like [...] (my favorite!).

What if you say you really want to get into advanced photo-manipulation and do all kinds of spectacular stuff?  Well then you might want to invest in something high end like Photoshop or a little lower like Aperture.  If you don't have any money you can get GIMP, which is a very powerful program but a little cumbersome to use, for free.

So Pixelmator is stuck in the middle, between the free, easy, less powerful online programs and the very difficult, very powerful, very expensive programs like Photoshop.  If you want more power than what you can get from online editors and have some time to invest to learn the program, Pixelmator would be a good choice.  BUT.... I think most casual users would actually do better to stick with online editors, and most power users will want something with more horsepower like Aperture or Photoshop.  Bottom line: Pixelmator is a fine program, but probably isn't for you."
Hefner worked for Esquire then he started Playboy and now he is trying to use the same formatting as Esquire. Good interviews and lots of informative articles here and there. Bravo.
"I really do hate giving a product only one star but this product has earned it.
I am puzzled because Corel has most of the facilities to produce a user friendly photo editing program at low cost.
After all, they have all of the routines coded already. In addition, since they bought out Ulead, they now have two different approaches to photo editing.

While I realize that they were targeting the casual photographer, that can be done with existing routines from their other products. I use Automatic Photo Correction all of the time from their Ulead Photoimpact product that does cost three times as much as this one does but it has so many more capabilities that cause it to cost that much more. But its basic functions could have been put into this product and been even easier to use than this one is with more capabilities and still meet their cost goals.

Their automatic photo correction isn't much better than Windows Picture Gallery and that is a free component of Windows.
The only major capabilities missing from Picture Gallery are the ability to change the picture size and to rotate the picture.
But those features are already functional in Photoimpact as well as several other Corel products.

The overall feeling I got using this product is the same I got using ACDSEE's editor only clumsier. The suggested retail price of ACDSEE is the same as for Photo Express but ACDSEE has so many more features they are not in the same league. Yet their target customer is the same as Corel's is, the casual photographer maintaining their home scrapbooks.

All I can say is that simple doesn't have to mean simplistic and even casual photo editors are going to want to do a few fancy things like add fancy text or stylize some of their photos."
Whoever gets these from Christmas will love them. Love eating there myself.
"I've read WOMAN'S DAY since the 1970s, and I'm sorry to give it only a two-star rating this year.  Each monthly issue seems to mirror the last - some health tips, a few recipes, perhaps some shopping or fashion advice.  WOMAN'S DAY once had multi-generational appeal.... I enjoyed it as a teen in the 70s and 80s.  Now it's target audience seems to be 30s and 40s females with children only.

Women's issues get short shrift, and one can gain better health and beauty information from MARIE CLAIRE or COSMO.

I'd like to see WOMAN'S DAY feature more recipes and articles, as it used to publish."
"I enjoyed Details Magazine, similar to GQ but skewed to a younger audience."
"After problems with versions 2010, 2011, and 2012, and associated weak tech support, plus the multitude of weak reviews for 2013, I was reluctant to try it. I guess it was a good idea to wait until Intuit had fixed most of the bugs. My incentive to check it out was the cloud and iPhone app, and even though I've hated Quicken for the past several years, I must admit that I like this version and the accessibility via our iPhones.

I won't give it a 5 until I've used it for more than the 30 days I've used it so far, and without the bugs I have experienced in past Intuit products. That said, at this point, I definitely recommend it for anyone wanting to set up and follow a budget and track savings, checking, and credit cards. I don't use the other features."
"This is my 14th review and completed adventure in the Nancy Drew series.

First, I'd like to start by dividing my review into two factions.
1) The game itself
2) My personal detective work.

* PART 1 *

PLOT: Off to the southwest and a shot at living life on an Arizona ranch!  Nancy Drew must discover why a phantom horse is seen every night whilst trouble follows immediately afterward via property destruction.

INITIAL SCORE: 83

CHARACTERS:

Dave Gregory : One of the most handsome men involved with ND games thus far, this ranch foreman is shy and seems to want to be more than friends with Nancy.  It never got weird or anything.  He lied to me, but I don't think I was invested enough in him to take it personally.

Tex Britten  : The ranch head wrangler that has no likeable personality.  Grunting out how I might fail goes only so far with me.

Shorty Thurmond: He looks a lot like my brother-in-law [balding & pronounced lips], so I had my guard up against him immediately.  He was an odd-looking dude. I don't know why picking the wrong vegetables were grounds for expulsion from the ranch. Don't you think the ranch owners should take personal responsibility for placing a novice with the obviously crucial task of picking out their food properly? Utterly ridiculous. They should be ashamed.

Mary Yazzie : A lot of reviewers didn't like her, but I thought she was fine. The love affair with Tex is understandable since both didn't get out too much.

Bess & George : The ""stuck in the airport business"" might seem overplayed, but judging from the realities of air travel life now, I would not doubt it could happen.  Between these two & the Hardy Boys, this game featured more hint systems than any other ND game out on the market. I can't say I liked it because I wanted to discover sleuthing for myself,  yet it was probably for the best since half the puzzles would have taken an extra four hours just by mental confusion. So in the end, I accepted it.

Ed & Bet Rawley: Owners of the Shadow Ranch I had mentioned early. Ed was annoying when he downplayed every single comment Bet made regarding Nancy & the adventure. He constantly acted as if Bet  was irritating him. I see this a lot with couples and I refuse to accept this as functional behavior. I give HER credit for the realism though!

 CUMUL SCORE: - 2 = 81

SCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:
The Magnificent Seven score was pretty enticing; made you feel triumphant! ha, ha. The Arizona desert had a beautiful appeal. The ghost town wasn't as great as other reviewers made it out to be. I didn't find it spooky nor engaging.  Lonely? yes

CUMUL SCORE: + 2 = 83

PUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: I liked the trivia challenge in the corral. Nice touch!  The chicken coop wire puzzle was interesting. The slot machine at Cappy's seemed unnecessary but was fun to play.

CUMUL SCORE: Even = 83

ADVENTURE ENDING: I guessed the culprit!!  The endgame [switching colored stones] seemed a rather hard concept for anyone to pick up without a walkthrough.  Again, I felt as if I invested all that energy into the story and there was no character payoff explanations on what happened in the weeks following [other than a 30 second update]. The actual treasure was a wonderful climax!!  I haven't seen that is a ND adventure before.

CUMUL SCORE: + 1 = 84

* PART 2 *

I try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to
take weeks! Well, it took me four days [14 hours] and I gave myself a
Detective Score Of : 68

My Strong Points: I did reasonably well on the ranch chores, guessed the culprit [which I have done in 7 of the 14 games thus far], and stayed steady with the games'  pacing. I navigated the cliff dwellings maze real well.

My Weak Points: Walkthroughs were important to me in the second half, I got to admit. I stumbled on the bead pattern puzzle for some reason [forgot there was an email solution from my best friends], and I was stuck on one errant ingredient with the cake for nearly an hour!

OVERALL GAME SCORE: 84 + 68/ 2 = 76 [ B ]

BOTTOMLINE: This ranked # 2 in Best Game by the fans, but I thought it  was just simply average as ND games go.  I tend to get bored more easily when the adventure is not scary, but that is just my personal taste.  I'd recommend it and it has an outside shot of cracking my Top Ten Overall ND games!

Thus far, on my list of the 21 completed ND games, SHADOW RANCH ranks..... # 13

1) GHOST DOGS OF MOON LAKE * 88.5
2) THE SHATTERED MEDALLION * 87
3) GHOST OF THORNTON HALL * 86.5
4) HAUNTING CASTLE MALLOY * 85.5
5) TREASURE ROYAL TOWER * 84
6) HAUNTED CAROUSEL * 83
7) WHITE WOLF ICICLE CREEK * 82.5
8) DANGER DECEPTION ISLAND * 81
9) MESSAGE HAUNTED MANSION * 80
10) WARNINGS AT WAVERLY * 78
11) SHADOW AT WATER'S EDGE * 77.5
12) THE CAPTIVE CURSE * 77
13) SECRET SHADOW RANCH * 76
14) TRAIL OF THE TWISTER * 72
15) PHANTOM OF VENICE * 71.5
16) TOMB OF THE LOST QUEEN * 71
17) THE SILENT SPY * 70.5
18) CURSE BLACKMOOR MANOR * 70
19) ALIBI IN ASHES * 69.5
20) THE DEADLY DEVICE * 69
21) SECRETS CAN KILL [REMAST] * 68"
Not useful any longer
"I admit it takes a bit of getting used to having socks on for sleep.  Especially if it is warm.  Which is when you need this product the most, during summer days running around barefooted.  You develop quite the thick-soled hooves!  I was able to do the perfect test as one of these socks slipped off during the night, so I had perfect data.

The foot that kept the sock on WAS smoother, moisturized, and softer.  No two ways about it.

The booties are really just all natural unbleached cotton no-show socks, thin material probably fits all sizes up to a 10.5, Womens.

I used some lovely Judith Krantz moisturizer and slipped on the socks.  A couple of hours later, one was off, I kept it off to see the difference.  And there is a difference.

I absolutely think this will be an enormous help if you have dry, cracked, and/or calloused feet.

Cold wash, hang to dry."
WONDERFUL!
"Great product. Advanced knowledge needed to take full advantage of all the features.

Wish list: More memory, more configuration ability with the setup wizard (for less-advanced operators), gigabit ethernet, wireless N. I imagine most if not all of these will make it into the next model upgrade."
"If you want to buy just one cooking magazine, then order this one.  Great for the budding chef (think college student gifts) or the gal or guy addicted to the Food Network."
I HATE the digital version! I have somehow landed on some video commercial loop for kitchen appliances and  can't stop get out of it...there are no 'x' or other options to exit and everything I touch or swipe plays the darn ad again.  I want my money back!!!!!
"Please read the UPDATE following the initial review.

1/28/08:  I'm using Turbo Tax ""Premiere"".  Or rather I'm trying to use it.  I figure they need to make it different year to year to justify the price, but they royally blew it this time.

Tabbing from one field to the next takes at least 30 seconds.  This is even when entering an address.  I even unplugged my internet connection as I thought Intuit was contacting the IRS or the CIA with every character I typed.

Trying to enter within the 30 second gap caused either the product or Vista to state that TurboTax was not responding only to wake up some time thereafter.  I'm guessing it's the product.

You don't know if the product has accepted your selection.  Maybe, maybe not.

I've used TT for years, gladly, but unless TurboTax (Intuit) comes out SOON with significant performance enhancements, I will not come back next year.

It is truly a painful experience.

UPDATE 1/31/08:  PLEASE READ

In my previous review, I stated that the performance of TurboTax Premier 2007 left a great deal to be desired, to say the least.  Since then, I have discovered that the root cause for the exceptionally poor performance was actually, once again, Microsoft.  The Machine Debug Manager, or MDM service, was running and is known to cause extremely poor performance.  It is some kind of debugger for Visual Studio, and runs automatically.  I went into the Task Manager, stopped the service, and disabled it.  Now, Turbo Tax performs as it always did.  I'd give it 4 stars, not 5, I'm still using it and haven't filed yet, and it still may tank (but I doubt it now).

Bill and Vista strike again."
"I've been involved with a couple of businesses using QuickBooks, one on Windows for many years, one on Mac for about 4 years. We upgraded the Mac users to QuickBooks for Mac 2012.

The good news: QuickBooks for Mac 2012 is a substantial upgrade, with great new features like incremental project invoicing, project timesheets that autofill like checks do, and cool new customer summaries for when you have a lot of projects and invoices with one customer. These are the types of enhancements expected from a mature product.

The other news: The Mac users, including one who moved from an earlier version of QuickBooks for Windows, are starting to get jealous of features available in the Windows version. Although this is not a review of Quicken for Mac, I've been unhappy about how Intuit has effectively dropped the ball with that product. So we're asking ourselves, will Intuit continue to enhance QuickBooks for Mac?

In the end, the enhancements in this version made us feel pretty good about it. It almost seems like Quicken designed the ones I mentioned above specifically for us. We want more, but we're already more productive.

Buy it, use it, there's nothing better on the Mac. But let's hope Intuit adds even more enhancements to the next version. And if they cut some of the annoying in-product ads, that would be great too."
"I have been reading Popular Mechanics for years, I find their articles more varied than before and very interesting."
"I purchased this full version so I could load it on my Macbook via bootcamp and it worked flawlessly. All of the drivers for my computer peripherals were loaded correctly. The At&T Uverse wireless internet was configured in a snap. Bootcamp is a great utility. I was only able to load 32 bit version because my mac was just on the outside of the requirements for 64 bit. But it still works great!  I really like this version of windows. We use XP at work and it was great for a while especially after win 95 but Win 7 is incredible. We skipped Vista so this upgrade was long overdue. Everything seems to work better. The Adobe CS 5 suite is amazing on Win 7. I wish there were better font management options. All in good time I assume.

*update* 7-23-2012
I have finally upgraded my Mac to lion and Win 7 still runs perfectly on the bootcamp drive. I had waited longer than I usually would to upgrade Mac OS X because I was reading that there was some issues with the bootcamp partition and OS X lion. Well, I had no issues whatsoever. I wish I would have upgraded earlier. This dual boot machine is the best thing that I have ever done. It's like have 2 computers with you at all times! I can't wait to get my hands on Win 8. It looks great!"
Great magazine
Bought this for my father (an avid Amazon.com user) and I am sure he used it within a few days.
"In a world where... sorry. But seriously, in a world where owners manuals are few and far between, the fact that this baby came loaded with them should have been a clear indication I was dealing with a complex program.

Let's face it, video editing is complex. Period. I appreciate the fact that a software maker respected that fact enough to include several manuals. They made the introduction of the app much easier. I didn't say easy.

Along with complex, the Power Director 11 suite is incredibly powerful. Far beyond my simplistic needs - yet, somehow, very affordable. How can they do that when another big-name software designer feels their product is worthy of a couple weeks' income? Perhaps because you'll be married to it, they figure it should cost like a ring!

If you are interested in video editing and want incredible flexibility, power, relative simplicity and the thoughfulness of real, printed manuals, you've found it. Cyberlink has a winner here."
After a long search I was finally able to locate this modem that is not only a fax and data modem but also a voice modem.  Voice modem is essential for answering machine type software on my computer.  The product is working as expected.
"MS has a little surprise for you AFTER you purchase and begin install. Upon attempting to download i got the message that Mavericks is incompatible with Office 2016 and you will have to ""upgrade"" to Yosemite or download a previous version of OFFICE 365 PERSONAL. Office is Yosemite restricted."
"The Norton Anti-Theft is easy to use thanks to 1-click operation.  It employs the most accurate available technology that allows to track up to 3 laptops, PCs, Android phones and tablets (devices) by providing their location to be viewed online especially useful in case of their loss or theft.  However, the location can be inaccurate, if GPS and Wi-Fi were unavailable. The tracking can be stopped and it can be uninstalled after successfully logging as the device's administrator, but that may not be easy. A photo of the thief can be taken using the laptop's webcam, but the feature is useless in desktops lacking cameras.  A file protection is not provided. Inferior to some competitors."
"There are a lot of powerful features in Serif PhotoPlus X4. That's good, but it can also be bad if you can't make them work. You have to enter your activation code the first time you run the program. Also, when you first run the program the ""What do you want to do?"" wizard is displayed. The wizard has a learning section which includes videos to demonstrate how a number of the features are used. The speakers have a British accent and can be a little hard to understand at times. You can't access any of the menus until you close the wizard. The initial display looks rather similar to Corel PaintShop Pro X2 / X3 if you're familiar with PaintShop.

There are some idiosyncrasies in Serif PhotoPlus X4. For example, if you choose the Save As command, the file types that you can choose from are only PhotoPlus' Spp format and the jpg format. If you want to save as another file format or if you want to use the optimizer to control picture size and quality, you have to use the Export command. Another example is the adjustments gallery on the right side of the workspace. This gallery shows a number of adjustments to choose from, like (color) levels, curves, color balance, brightness/contrast, hue/saturation, channel mixer, gradient map, lens filter, etc. However, once you select one of these options and make an adjustment, you probably won't be able to see how to return to the adjustments menu. The reason is that the back button to return to the adjustments gallery is hidden. You'll have to drag the bottom border of the adjustments box down so that the back button is displayed. I prefer the way that Google's Picasa gives you adjustment options on the Effects menu because you can see a small image to preview what the adjustment might look like before you choose it. That's not the case with the adjustments box where you have to first choose an option and then you see the effect. There is also a PhotoFix feature which is similar to the adjustments box. And PhotoPlus has a Filter Gallery which is similar to the Picasa Effects in that it does show an small image which gives a preview of what the filter does.

There are some powerful features in Serif PhotoPlus that you may like. The ""cut out"" feature for cutting objects out of a picture is excellent. The makeover feature is good for removing red eyes, whitening teeth, removing blemishes, etc. You can work with raw files. There are also macros available for the power user.

At times the program would not let me do the things that I thought should be easy to do. For example, I cut out two different images and I wanted to paste one as a new layer on the other, but the command to paste a new layer was grayed out. Another time I did an adjustment to a picture and then I wanted to use the Cut Out Studio, but the Cut Out Studio command was grayed out and I could not select it. Another time I opened a photo and the photo was not displayed. So it was frustrating at times."
"I started with Windows 3 and upgraded myself past the much-heralded Windows 95, the Millennium edition, straight through to Vista (which was supposed to eradicate the bad taste that was affixed to the word Windows). After awhile, they all became a blur with features being added, and then dropped, without rhyme or reason. Overall, however, there was nothing that really made it a better version of Windows.

Windows 7 shows proof that Microsoft listened to the customers and decided to give them a product that met their needs.  Windows 7 (I'm referencing the Ultimate version, 64 bit) was a very long install (I upgraded from Vista) clocking in at 5 hours. Immediately I felt a pang of disappointment when it did not keep all of my settings (sounds, image size for folders). However, that was not the end of the world and I promptly forgot about it when I realized that Microsoft gave us Windows 7 and they managed to provide me with two necessary elements where I refused to compromise: the program gave me back disk space so I went from a hard drive almost half full to one that now has 65% disk space free.  Not bad at all. Then, I immediately became aware that this is the first version of Windows where speed is of the essence. Whether rebooting, opening programs (which I can now keep on the bar instead of searching the START menu (you can still pin them there so don't worry)), saving files, etc., Windows 7 moves so fast that my three year old HP notebook was rejuvenated.

Windows 7 does have some bells and whistles: SNAP allows me to open two programs (I tried it with WORD and ONE NOTE) and have them side-by-side. It's easy even though you might not use it frequently. You can also add sticky notes and get a sneek-peek of open programs. Nice.

It isn't often that you upgrade (or even purchase) a program where you immediately notice major differences but Windows 7 not only retains the best features of former Windows programs, it adds benefits to the end user."
I bought my first issue of this magazine last month and I loved it!!  Got this month's issue and it is great as well.  Would recommend this to everyone.
"The title should say it all.

This is a Microsoft product - and follows along in a long line of poorly designed-for-the-average-user technology/software.

I hope to warn you so you'll avoid the hell I've been having.

Fun for a birthday gift and very well received
Good price....like the magazine.
"Microsoft has been trying to become a serious player in accounting software for quite some time.  Office Accounting Professional is an obvious attempt to make a dent in the low end of the market and chip away at the lock&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/QuickBooks-Pro-2008/dp/B000V4PLWM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">QuickBooks Pro 2008</a>&nbsp;has on that segment.  The basic look and function of the program is so similar to Quickbooks, in fact, that one could easily mistake it for the current king of the hill.

To test this product, I set up books for a small business that I recently started and entered a number of basic transactions.  While some processes weren't as intuitive as I might have liked, it's relatively user friendly and it doesn't take long to get things done.  Like Quickbooks, the internal controls are awful and you can freely edit past transactions with no real audit trail.  This is convenient if you make a mistake, but a major no-no for those trying to run a genuine accounting department.

Office Accounting Professional is a competent program for those running a mom and pop business, but would not be sufficient for any more than that.  Unfortunately, I didn't see anything here that is a real improvement over Quickbooks and because of that, I don't recommend the product.  Because Quickbooks enjoys a near-monopoly in this market, there are several advantages to buying it.  Many bookkeepers and tax preparers will be able to take a copy of your data file and do their work, but none of them are likely to have this product.  The same is true of pre-formatted check stock and many other things.  This is not bad software, it's just not compelling enough to give up the advantages of owning the dominant package."
This was my first time using such product. It was a good learning experience. This is very easy to use and not much advance skill necessary.
Keeps my computers protected with minimum impact on performance.  I don't have to worry about viruses and I can rest assured my data and systems are protected.
"Sometimes pouring over page after page is difficult.
If that describes you, this is a great tool for learning or brushing up on Lightroom. Converting files, how to back up, it's a LOT of information. Not always as clear as I would have liked, sometimes you just want something streamlined. Still, nice to have this format as an option.
Tim Grey has written quite a few books on Photoshop as well as this video tutorial, which now has a newer version."
"In the days of high-speed internet connection, the need of compressing files for sending over internet is diminished. Now that window has a built-in program to unzip files directly, the usage of the WinZip is even further reduced. Even worse yet, window's explorer provides a better user-interface experience than WinZip in terms of un-compressing function.

So, what do we expect from the aging WinZip package? The newly added features probably are the reasons to buy it. The watermarking option is quite useful for making sure photos posted online don't get ripped off easily. The encryption option is another benefit to send sensitive materials over the wire. Also, WinZip can connect directly to the cloud folders (like SkyDrive, Dropbox...etc) and let you compress files, extract files and encrypt files in those size-limited folder. Another feature, WinZip allow you to covert files to PDF format. Doing so can prevent files from being editing by others.

All in all, WinZip is trying to stay alive by incorporating additional features. It's no loner a must-have tool."
Anything from Corel is pretty good and at a good price.  I also have other products and love them all.

"I haven't tried this years yet, but I have used this tax software for years. My last experience, years ago, with TurboTax was that it was loaded with bloatware. In trying to remove the bloatware after doing my taxes, it crashed my computer. I promised myself then to never ever use TurboTax again, and I haven't. H & R Block has always done a super job for me."
This was a great gift and an awesome place to eat with friends or family. I will choose to give this gift card for special occasions and holidays again. It was well received by all.

"*** Dragon Dictate 4 (""DD4"") is still a valuable update of DD3. Recognition quality is significantly better than that of DD3. DD4 offers a higher performance with drastically reduced latency and faster editing.  The improved accuracy of new DD4 makes it worth upgrading from DD3 and - obviously - begin creating documents without typing using DD starting from DD4, as a new user. DD4 is the way to go to dictate regularly for more than short occasional texts.  There is no lag between the time of the pause to allow Dragon Dictate to type the words and their appearance in the documents when the slider is in the middle between Speed and Accuracy in the Recognition tab.  DD4 allows the transcription feature to transcribe any single speaker's voice recorded on a dictaphone after a brief training process instead of just yourself by DD3.  However, this feature works well only with studio quality recordings.  So, DD4 can transcribe speeches or lectures read slowly and not extemporized, but not interviews."
"I've had scalp issues my entire life and this is the only brand that not only didn't cause problems but cleared up problems I've had since I was a kid. I can remember my grandpa playing with my hair when I was eight and then going ""Good grief, her scalp is one giant scab!"" but since I've started using Nature's Gate I barely even have dandruff, much less scabs. I cannot express enough how much I love this brand. I may joke about the vegan shampoo thing, but everyone who knows me knows how much I adore this company and their products. The fact that the range of products also happens to smell delectable is just a bonus for me. When I moved somewhere where it wasn't easily found in stores I did try some other paraben and sulfate free shampoos and that was SUCH a disaster. I was just lucky it didn't give me horrible sores (which has happened in the past when trying different shampoos). So I got online and got my shampoo."
"I just LOVE this body wash.  The smell is so fresh and clean, just what I was always searching for.  Too many other brands are just too floral or ""sweet"" for my taste, almost as though it's doubling as a perfume after the shower, but not this one.  It's so light and just...perfect.  I'm noticing a lot of reviews mentioning the reviewer's significant other loving the smell and I'm thinking maybe it's a guy thing to love a simple clean smell on a woman (not bathed in perfume) because my husband loves the faint smell of this body wash after I take a shower.  Last thing I'll mention is how I love that this body wash does not dry out my skin.  I have very dry skin, and usually the combination of a hot shower and body wash leaves my skin red and itchy.  After using this, I can either forgo the lotion after my shower or just use a light moisturizer.  Favorite body wash, hands down."
Martha Stewart Living magazine is an excellent magazine!!  I have been receiving it for about a year now and I will continue on renewing my subscription!!  I enjoy the articles and the how tos!!  Thank you Martha Stewart Living!!
"As usual, TurboTax is easy to follow and get my taxes done quickly."
"I went for years without using PC protection of any sort, because I consider myself computer-savvy enough to know that the most important aspects of computer protection are just being able to recognize when something's not right with the machine, keeping personal data in safe places, and knowing where NOT to go online. However, since I have a dedicated machine just for internet access, I went ahead and started using&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AVG-Internet-Security-2011-3-User-Old-Version/dp/B003WT1KFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AVG Internet Security 2011 (3-User) [Old Version</a>]. I had a great experience with that product, and since Kaspersky is the other 'big name' in internet security, I went with this for the sake of comparison.

The good news is that Kaspersky Internet Security is very low-resource, so it doesn't hog memory or processing power. The interface is very intuitive and easy to use, and all the major tools (Firewall, scanning tools) are user-friendly, easily modifiable, and easy to access. One of the things I appreciate about this software is that even when detecting threats, it doesn't automatically make changes to the system or to problematic files, instead giving the user the option to take action- something EVERY protection program should do, and something that distinguishes Kaspersky (and AVG, which operates the same way) from the 'lesser' security products (Norton, McAfee, etc.).

Unfortunately, my practical experience with Kaspersky left a lot to be desired. Firstly, I had to uninstall and reinstall because on the first take, there were a few modules that didn't operate as they should have. I won't go into technical details, but I encountered other instances of the problems I had on the Kaspersky help forums, and reinstallation was Kaspersky's recommended solution.

Secondly (and more importantly), I found the protection to be weak. My first move after installing was to 'test' the protection by exposing my machine to files and online locations that I knew should trigger responses (daring, yes, but I know what I'm doing enough to be able to trigger protection response without actually putting my machine at risk). I was very disappointed in the performance- several items that should trigger ANY protection program simply did not, and several files with known threats scanned clean. Although none of these things were actually threats, I don't like knowing that POTENTIAL threats are going unnoticed, especially when the same threats were recognized by AVG. I had the same experience with several 'hot' online sites- sites that run suspect scripts weren't flagged, and they should have been.

In no way can I say that this will be every user's experience. Kaspersky has a great reputation as a top-shelf product, and I'm hesitant to say that someone who's looking at a security program shouldn't buy this. All I can do is offer MY experience and compare it to my experience with AVG, which was always 'on the ball' in terms of catching potential threats. In the end, I uninstalled Kapsersky and renewed my AVG subscription.

As always, prospective buyers should take my review into consideration along with the reviews of others and try to make an informed decision, but in light of my experience, I can't recommend this product and would instead recommend the latest version of AVG's internet security, which has continued to serve me well."
I enjoy tinkering with Cyberlink PowerDVD and use it frequently.  With an electronics variety store sitting around the house and in the car PowerDVD makes good sense to use since it provides the ability to access each different device to play whatever is stored where ever it is stored.  It comes in handy when I have to wait in a doctor's office or for some other event elsewhere and I had sense enough to take my tablet that already has Cyberlink ready to play.  There may be some other products like Cyberlink but I did not check into them because why bother when this one works so well.
When a gift card arrives with the value you purchased I guess it gets 5 stars?!!

"Better than average, quite well as a matter of fact.  Still running after 2 years.  Good range also.  XP users be advised to have at least Service Pack 2 (or 3 is recomended) installed to identify stations properly that use more than WEP encryption."
Seems to work fine. I like it except for so many pop up messages.
"I was very happy to get this product. I am Japanese American myself but am ashamed to say pretty much the only Japanese I know is being able to order from a menu, or else the more impolite words like ""bakatare"" (stupid) or ""yakamashi"" (loudmouth) or ""monku"" (complaining.. hence the ""monkuboy"" moniker, haha). While my friends went to Japanese school on Saturday mornings I resisted and my parents never forced me so I learned nothing. However, I bet everyone who went forgot how to speak or understand it anyway so we all wound up at the same place.

Regarding this program: The box is impressively heavy. It installed without a hitch using the accurate instructions, though it did take a fairly long time. The headset installed without a hitch also - I use Windows XP and it recognized the device right away and the first test with the software was successful.  It is a rather flimsy headset so you have to treat it gently.  Also, make sure you turn down the volume on your PC before using it because the voices are LOUD.

The lessons are pleasant to take and the sessions last about half an hour which seems about right to digest things. Even though most of it is intuitive as far as what to do (repeat the phrase, match something to a picture, etc.), there is a help screen present and the guidebook that comes with the set is also helpful.

I find Japanese is harder to learn than say Spanish or French because there's hardly any similarity to English (except when they borrow English words, like ""juice"" becomes ""juisah"")in the words or structure. I think the full immersion method is good because it forces you to use the language. I expect to have a basic knowledge after I finish with everything and to be able to converse on a very elementary level.

However, no matter what method you use, it has to be practiced frequently, with a native speaker.  Just like my friends who went to J-School back then, if you don't use it you lose it. At least my parents speak some Japanese and I know a few other people who do so I can bludgeon them with my efforts but for those who don't have someone to practice with, it makes it difficult.

I know someone who has the Korean version of this and he likes it very much (and he has a Korean wife so he gets a lot of free help!).

Overall, I rate this as a very good package for those who want to learn the language. The lessons are clear and understandable, and flow from one to the other in a sensible and logical way. I would certainly recommend it."
"There is so much that can be said about security software. It can be either a hit or a miss in regards to the best of what is done to protect your computer from any damage. But trying to find the right one can work to your advantage, while looking for the wrong one, can actually lead to the end of your computer. This security software from Avast specifically for your Mac computers, doesn't actually deliver for the money. Instead it does slow the speed and the quality of your Apple computer. I found this software to be very easy to install. However, it was very easy for spyware to slowly go into my computer. It honestly might seem like a good buy, but overall it definitely might be more of a heartbreak. I really found better antivirus programs to be worth the money like Norton and Bitdefender. Overall, I would recommend a software that really delivers more for the money, than something free, and can ruin a computer.

"Quicken Deluxe 2014 is OK ...  ...but with one or two items that I can't use.  After using Quicken 2010 for some time, the budgeting tool on 2014 was hard to get use to.  I did not like it at first, but the more I worked with it the better it got and now it is working fine and saving me money.  One thing that I have definitely changed:  when I write a check, I don't put it in checking.  I put it in the mail and wait for it to reach my account and then, after the bank processes it, it downloads into checking.  This is a better way because it is one hundred percent accurate.  I don't know how the budgeting tool will work with downloading, but I will see.
  As far as items that I can't use:  Quicken has a tool that allows for setting a savings goal, I can't use it because I already have a savings account that I download.  I don't need another savings account.  By the way, I don't have any of those mobile devices that you talk about.  I have no need for them."
"This was purchased to upgrade a client's PC from vista. This client had been having all sorts of trouble but was hesitant to change.

The upgrade went quite smoothy. Pre upgrade prep was mainly getting new drivers for peripherials. The issues are now resolved. The client is happy and their system is running better than before. More stable, faster and just better."
Fast shipping and just as described.
"I had no problems downloading to my laptop and as usual am very happy with the product.  We have been using Quicken for years to monitor investments, we are able to know where we are on a daily basis using this product."

"I ordered Rosetta Stone Chinese in an attempt to learn a difficult language in the easiest and most comprehensive manner possible. I failed, but not because of Rosetta Stone. I really thought I could master Mandarin as I previously learned German in college and became fluent in Spanish and lived in Latin America for eight years. I assumed learning Chinese would be a similar process.

Rosetta Stone does a great job on their language learning product. The software installed flawlessly on my iMac, registered quickly and I was up and running in short order. The program method is interesting in that it provides graphic scenarios with spoken conversation that the student is tested on for comprehension and repeating with feedback on both. This was nothing like I had experienced with German or Spanish which were largely based on vocabulary, dialogues, sentence structure, verb tenses and the like. Rosetta Stone is more like ""total immersion"" where the student is exposed to the language from the git go with repetitive phrases and progress feedback.

My operational experience with the program was flawless but I became frustrated very early on with my inability to distinguish the subtle differences among the Chinese words. After many sessions of null progress I elected to put it aside until I could find a Community College program where I could get face to face interaction with (hopefully) a native speaker(s) and use Rosetta Stone to augment the instruction.

If you have the ability to determine subtle differences in tonal changes you may find success with Rosetta Stone Chinese. If you are like me, who can't tune an instrument other than a radio, you may want to consider this program as a valuable adjunct to classroom instruction.

In summation, I really liked the Rosetta Stone approach and the functionality of the software but I was unsuccessful getting very far due to my inability to understand a very difficult language."
"Sage 50 Pro is easy to use also by non-accountants for up to 30 employees. Some screens closely resemble paper-based forms such as invoices or checks. Payroll tax cannot be entered directly and managing payroll without a $270-$380 subscription is difficult, but not impossible. Payroll calculations can be tediously imported. Similarly, Excel allows to import the data from another accounting programs, like QuickBooks, through manual linking of individual fields.

The Complete version adds credit card protection, bill payment, synchronization with Outlook, audit trail reporting, depreciation management, and phase and cost code level. The Premium version adds multiple budgets incl. selective printing, change orders, serialized inventory, and easier data archiving and restoring.

Sage 50 provides all the controls for accounting practices, extensive documentation and tutorials. The installation is simple, but may require turning firewall off. Then, a choice between the cash and accrual accounting, or real and committed transactions, must be made. Information can be displayed numerically or in flowchart format. Left navigation bar allows to choose a topic page. Any can be made the default start screen and each can be customized. Tabs at the bottom open shortcut lists, which can be customized, directly linking to ledgers and tasks pertaining invoices, payments, bills, lists, transaction, and general journal.

The inventory can be evaluated based on not only average cost, but also Last In First Out (LIFO), First In First Out (FIFO). Data can be moved to Excel also with a new template, which can be customized. The accounts can be reconciled by changing back entries and not accounting periods. Multiple vendor records can be deactivated based on a cutoff date. Long descriptions can be printed without voided checks."
This is for my husband to use for lunches when he really needs to get out of the office for a break.
"I have a number of clients who have XP running on computers that will support windows 7 64bit. With no real in-place upgrade from Windows XP doing an OEM install makes good economical sense.

Why Windows 7 and not Windows 8? My client base falls into 2 groups. The differentiator is whether they have a touch screen and if they do Windows 8 is OK but with a learning curve. So many clients are opting to go with Windows 7 instead of 8.

The main thing we check on the system to be upgraded is how much memory the system can support. We upgrade the system to at least 4GB and preferably 8GB.

An excellent desktop operating systems giving new life to existing systems and helping my client's cost management is worth 5 stars to me."
"This is ok but I'm not sure how it's levels 1-3. I got it because my son is taking Spanish and we took Spanish many years ago. I thought it would be a great way to strengthen his skills and rebuild ours together. But, this is mainly good for conversational phrases to be used while traveling."
"I have been a PowerDVD user since the 7th version came out years ago. I love it for what I use it which is the basic playback of DVD's and now Bluray's on my computer systems. I love that this installs smoothly and without any quirks. The main computer I use this on has had some issues in the past with the previous version's of PowerDVD and giving me some trouble with freezing, locking up and just not working properly...but, this version has been heavenly. I haven't had any issues playing even the largest files. When I try to run Windows Media Player or any other basic functioning video player for files over 4 GB they have such a noticeable lag and they sputter along and the quality is never up to par. But that's not the case with this awesome software. I can play 8 GB files and not only does it make it through the entire film with no issues but it looks and sounds AMAZING! I love this software. I definitely recommend it to those who need a software program that allows them to view their Bluray's or video files with the best picture and sound quality out there."
So much better thank you
"While I can create pretty nice projects with this, there are some issues that I might call ""problematic."" Many of the features that seem to justify the ""Ultimate"" label (and, consequentially, the ""Ultimate"" price) seem like extraneous additions that few will use (or few will use with any amount of frequency). If forced to speculate, I would say that most consumers could easily purchase the ""Plus"" edition"" of this software (for considerably less) and be equally (if not more) satisfied.

Now, I have yet to experience any issues with the software. However, I have two friends who are also using it ...  and they have both had issues with it crashing. So, I'm basically bracing that to happen and hoping that it won't. If there are any incidents, I will update this post.

Having experimented with both the ""Plus"" and the ""Ultimate,"" I highly recommend the ""Plus!!"""
"Windows Home Premium came bundled on my new Dell computer (I5 processor). Maybe the 64 bit operating system is necessary to utilize the new Intel processors. Other than that, my experience is that this product has NOTHING to recommend it and I would hardly call it an ""upgrade.""

(1) Older software for which I paid hundreds of dollars now works poorly if at all. As an example, Corel PhotoPaint (which I use for illustrations in technical articles) often crashes with something about a SmartHeap error. AAA Map and Go does not work at all. And I have used Compatibility Mode in an attempt to make them work properly. This in fact did correct a problem with my TomTom software, which is hardly a relic from the 8 bit or 16 bit operating system days.

(2) A laser printer for which I paid a couple of hundred dollars is now a paperweight because there is no 64 bit driver for it. The manufacturer's technical support department claims it did try to develop one but was not successful.

(3) Navigation of files with Windows Explorer is somewhat more difficult with the Windows 7 version than the XP version.

The biggest problem is however security. I have spent (wasted) hours fighting with Windows 7 over permission to modify or delete files and/or registry keys. Even though I am the computer's sole owner and user, many files have four or five ""users"" (e.g. System, Administrator) with different permission levels. I am now trying to install an update to my virus protection software but keep getting slammed with Error 1402, which shuts down the installation. Windows 7 blocked me from trying to apply the comprehensive solution to Error 1402 that I found online. Disabling User Account Control did not work either. My computer is therefore now without virus protection, so Windows 7 is quite frankly now a security exposure for me, although the virus software's manufacturer does offer support and can probably help me on Monday.

I am an experienced user and, despite hours spent searching Microsoft and other sites for a solution to the 1402 error, have not been able to find one. I can only imagine the frustration a regular home user or even small business person might have with this, or how much time even a large corporation's IT department could waste on fixing these issues.

Update August 21 2012

Features (e.g. Windows Update) simply do not work, and neither do the programs Microsoft supplies to correct the problems.

When I run Windows Update, it shows that 16 updates, including those related to security and function, are ready to install. I tell it to go ahead and do so, and it simply tells me the updates were not installed with a worthless error message: ""Windows Update Encountered an Unknown Error""

I ran MicrosoftFixit.wu. LB.25268956865207935.1.1. Run.exe and it returned the message, ""Repair Windows Update Components: Not Fixed"" (another highly useful and informative Microsoft error message). Microsoft FixIt ""Explore Additional Solutions"" is an equally worthless Web page with no specific information whatsoever--only useless generalities.

These are just a couple of examples. This product is poorly designed, unreliable, and quite frankly worse than useless.

Windows now scrambles my desktop icons instead of saving them as I arranged them (e.g. by category and function). Solutions posted online do not work."
"I like Nuance products.  From their PDF converter software to Dragon Naturally Speaking, they make quality products.  In this case, Dragon Naturally Speaking allows you to dictate documents, control basic PC functions, and more.  For example, you just have to say ""Send email to John Doe and Jane Doe,"" and it will open Outlook (assuming that is your default email program) and enter the email addresses for both recipients (again assuming you have both in your address book).  Then you simply dictate your email, and viola, send your email!

I have found Dragon 11 to be very accurate, although it cannot know if I mean ""to, too, or two.""  If you thought you could simply put the keyboard away, well, you can't.  Nevertheless, you will find much more that you can do without a keyboard than ever before!

Dragon is compatible with Windows 7 64.  In fact, it works with 64 bit systems with the exception of Windows XP.

There are only two potential drawbacks.  First, Windows 7 and Vista both already come with voice command software built in.  Those work faster than Dragon, but they do less.  You should check your included software first to see if it already does what you need.  Second, tech support is difficult to access.  You can't just send an email.  You have to register with the Nuance site, click on the verification email, then enter each of your products with serial numbers before you can ask your question.  Unnecessary steps, since you wouldn't be asking for tech support if you didn't own the product!"

"iLife is a collection of fun and useful apps. I would call them toys because they are fun, but they are much more powerful and useful than that.

iPhoto - great for organizing your photos and videos. Face detection is lots of fun. Several basic enhancement tools are included that eliminate much of my need for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Photoshop/dp/B001EUIVZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Photoshop</a>. Now I just spin up GIMP when my needs go beyond what iPhoto can offer.

iMovie - I haven't used iMovie 09 much, but older versions of iMovie were great for building simple videos out of DV footage and still images.

iDVD - I haven't used the latest version of iDVD yet, but it has always been a great app for mastering simple DVD content.

GarageBand - Amazing musical toy. Very serious musicians will probably find GarageBand too limited, but it is lots of fun for people who are casually interested in making music. You get plenty of loops and sounds to throw together your own tracks. MIDI support is limited, but it is a very fun environment to play around in.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logic-9/dp/B002ISDD1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logic 9</a>&nbsp;will give you far more power if you feel constrained by GarageBand.

Update - If you got iLife with your new mac, be sure to drop in the DVD and install the extra GarageBand instruments and loops. A lot of great creative content is included."
"I've used and liked Cyberlink for years now, upgraded (RIGHT!!) to this...""PowerDirectorContentPack_150527_ContentPack_Essential_PCP150526-06.exe"" is corrupt, please download another copy, etc.  I installed without the content packs on my main machine, so I figured I'd just copy the offending file from that install, be fine.  Not.  Also corrupt, so I waited through another download, ran it, corrupt again.  Got on line hoping against hope that the company had a hotfix with just this file, not to be.  Now I see all kinds of people having the same issue, and been going on for a while.  I don't know what it takes to get the company to not just listen, but FIX the issue.  I'm far from a beginner at this so I'll keep trying, and will escalate as need be and update this review with any progress, but I'm not hopeful."
"WinZip 18 software is excellent for archiving and compressing files. It's still the best around for compressing large files (and the best one to use for zip files). If I was simply needed something to open already zipped files; however, I still prefer open source software like 7-zip for opening already archived files, which I personally find easier to use."
Gets the job done. No complaints. Cheaper than bringing your taxes to someone else to do. This program is really straight forward.
Different from what I usually read. I like it.
"This product seemed to work very well.  It was not overly intrusive and did not bog down the systme like Norton Antivirus of several years ago did.  It installed easily on  Win 7 and Win 8.1 64 bit systems.  i had no errors or problems of any kind.

Highly recommended."
"Horrible, absolutely horrible.  About one time out of 25 tries, this program will load and I can use it.  Other than that, it just does nothing when I try to open it, or it takes 30 minutes to load about 950 songs that I have in it.  This is on Windows 10.  I have quit purchasing music from Amazon because of this."
"I've been a PaintShop user from way back when it was a JASC product. It has always been the less expensive alternative to Photoshop with much of the functionality. I have had mixed feelings about the Corel versions as they tend to be slower loading with a fairly large system footprint and in the more recent versions almost as cumbersome and confusing as Photoshop.

This current offering continues to suffer from those flaws (but only enough to cost them one star in the rating) though still offering the features that I have always valued in Paintshop. The tool is easy enough to use, once you pass the initial learning curve, and priced to make it accessible to the non-corporate user. Installation was easy and uneventful, startup on my dual-core system was slow as expected, but ran smoothly once up.

One feature that continues to improve over the years is the shape fitting selection (something that used to be the shape or outline wizard and is now being called Magic Move), still not perfect and does require a little help with touch-up, but leaps and bounds over what used to be required to cut and move a non-standard shape within a picture. I still love the layering (originally discovered it in Photoshop, and loved when introduced to PaintShop).

Overall, a solid set of improvements on the previous version, maybe enough to warrant springing for the upgrade if you still run version 7, any version earlier than that is a definite candidate for upgrade. P-)"
"I'm not sure why so many people are having problems downloading and installing Microsoft Office 365. As long as an account is setup before trying to downloading the product, it downloaded and installed easily for me. Yes, it took time. After all, this is a bloated Microsoft product. This version of Office is sort of a hybrid, or so it feels - partly in the cloud, but mostly on your computer. That it good for people on the go and need to access documents that may have been saved at different locations on different machines or devices. Documents can be saved to the Skydrive associated with your account. In order to use this program, unlike a standard office version, you must be logged into the account you created, or a previous account that can be linked to the subscription. The subscription includes free apps (must be downloaded from the app stores) for iPhone and I would imagine Android and Windows mobile as well, which allow viewing and editing documents as well as accessing the Skydrive from a mobile device (Don't tell the boss about this).

The new look of Office 365 is more in line with Windows 8, but it is flat, colorless and dull. Microsoft does not give you many options to change it either. There are three different themes to choose from - White, Light Gray and Dark Gray. Wow! Microsoft really? I would at least have expected a light blue like Office 2007 offered. At least if White or Light Gray is chosen there is a thin line of color at the bottom status bar, with dark gray chosen this is black. The color changes based on the program being used - blue for Word, green for Excel, etc. There is also a background pattern that can be chosen which is really just in the top right hand corner of the screen. These uninteresting patterns are grey, but vary in shade based on the ""theme"" chosen. Pretty unexciting.

As far as functionality goes, Office hasn't changed that much in the last few versions, there is a customizable ribbon at the top which changes based on the tab that is chosen. Microsoft has done away with any sort of shading or shadowing to make the ribbon stand out in any way, it is incredibly flat looking, which is kind of disconcerting, and at times confusing. Clicking on ""File"" (which for some reason always has a colored box around it) slides open another screen where there are other options. This is where more of a Windows 8 look comes into play (and a little bit more color). The options are pretty much the same as in other Windows versions, just presented differently. Save As offers an option to save to the computer as well as to the Skydrive. Microsoft installs a program that loads when the computer is started that keeps the Skydrive in sync with all the documents saved there. The icon in the computer's toolbar is a cloud with a green line moving from left to right. Because it is constantly synching, there is a noticeable, but not intolerable lag when typing, as compared to a non-cloud based system.

Office 365 comes with a license for up to 5 PC's or Macs which makes the $99.00 a year (at time the of review) price a good deal if utilizing all of them, since it offers the full Office suite, 20 GB storage on the Skydrive and 60 minutes of Skype per month all included in the subscription. It does not turn out to be such a good deal if it is only being used on one PC or Mac, in which case it might be better to get a non-subscription version which costs more upfront, but can be used until its obsolescence at no charge. The other versions offer the same features without the Skype credits and less storage space on the Skydrive. Windows 7 or 8 is required to run any new version of Microsoft Office product.

Microsoft Office is pretty much the world standard for software of this type. Other software has come and gone, so it is almost essential to own some version of Office these days. While Office 365 is not my favorite version that Microsoft has created, it's not that bad either. The lack of color makes their product boring and hard to navigate, and because there is no option to change this is frustrating. Microsoft needs to put some style into its office products."
"This has a stronger scent than I would expect from a Dove product but it lessened once I used it with water and washed up. It feels nice and does a good job.

As mentioned the scent is strong but lessens when you use the soap. It is hard to describe the scent. It is not a perfume or cologne scent but more of a clean soap smell. I can smell it on my hands after using the soap and it smells fine.

The soap is slightly rounded and shaped so it is easy to hold and easy to use on my body. The color is not the clean white you get in some Dove soaps but a darker color that I would expect in a product that has ""purifying grains.""

This feels great on my skin and leaves a clean smell after use. I really like this."
"I was happy to upgrade my corel version 12 to the new corel x4 and .to be honestly after 3 days of stragling with this new version I starting to give up ,it suck . the program crash many time for any change aplying affect's  to your work , or you  have to wait until 1 0r 2 minutes to screen set up and keep working with a proyect. complete dissaponted. better corel come up with a update solution to this problem and even adding up the memory  from 25 to 75 still pretty slow."
"I installed Norton Utilities on my computer after using CCleaner for a few years. I can honestly say that Norton does a much more detailed job of cleaning things on my computer then CCleaner didn't get. However, there are things that I lost that I can't get back, including some of my passwords on websites that I forgot. I don't think I could recommend Norton Utilities, because I feel that there can be some improvements."
"I was one of the people that bailed on TurboTax after a decade of using it when the played their pricing/feature game this year. This software seems to do an equivalent job and both my sister and I think it's a bit easier to use and more informative. We did have some installation issues on her Windows Vista system as well as my Windows 7 Pro. It was messing up during the first of the install. After a couple of reruns it finished the install okay. The 'free' pdf writer software that came with it didn't seem to work correctly. Adobe Reader said the file was corrupt but I wouldn't put it past Adobe to make reading pdf files not of Adobe origins problematic.
If there was a stumbling block inside the program it was how to get through the final review/error check. The software would present you with defacto errors and also with questionable entries you needed to ""verify"". It was not always straightforward to understand what was suspect about the 'questionable' entries. Sometimes there was nothing to go on as to why an entry would need a second look."
"I've tried both major tax software packages (this and H&R Block's) as well as the TurboTax Online version. While none of them is perfect, I think this is the best of the three. What sets this apart is that you have the option to do your taxes via a very simple interactive step-by-step ""interview"" or, if you know what you're doing, you can actually just jump from topic to topic. You even have the ability to just go to specific forms and fill them out directly. This flexibility means you can quickly fill out an area you're familiar with, but have the software lead you slowly through unfamiliar topics. I find that I generally go direct to things I've done several years in a row, but will do the step-by-step interview for areas that are new to me (e.g. when I first got married, or had kids, or got a small royalty check from a patent). If you get a form in the mail you don't recognize (1099-G, for example) you just do a search for it in the software and it tells you where to go.

They don't tell you this, for obvious reasons, but there is really very little extra you get with Premier and Home Business. It's mostly little bonuses that you get, like online databases for valuing deductions. Deluxe has all the forms an individual could possible need; the main difference is in how much help you'll get filling them out.

My recommendation is that you save some money and start with this, or even Basic. If you actually come across anything that you really need a higher version for, or that would be nice to have, you can upgrade the software online and pay a bit extra, keeping all the work you've already done. The software makes it very easy to upgrade in-place in the middle of filling out your returns. My guess is that you won't ever have to, however."
"I haven't had a chance to grab into all the features but it is immediately apparent that this is a highly functional product. For the hobbiest who just want to shoot a few family flicks, this product may be a little too challenging and not worth the price but for the individual who wants the feel of a professional operation, this is an ideal offering. It does have a rather steep learning curve and I would recommend using either the available tutorials or looking into a purchased instruction. It will be difficult to get the most from the product without some help.

Read through the other reviews before you purchase. They were right on!"
"Was suppose to get to me in a day took 4 days lol, still good."
"For the most part I just needed something that was not a memory hog for basic word processing and simple calculations here and there.  On a regular notebook I tend to use an older version of MS Office with Word and Excel but while on the road I use a slimmed down netbook a lot more often for which this Corel Office product is suitable.

I also tend to use a portable external hard drive regardless of which computer I'm using so it is important to be able to go back and forth between the Microsoft and Corel file formats.  Given my basic needs and the huge cost differential between this and MS Office, Corel Office works just fine.

I do like this better than Open Office which is similar and may be downloaded for free.  Overall it is the Paint Shop Pro of office suites.  Chances are it may not meet the needs of the most demanding users but does have sufficient functionality and capabilities for most basic activities that one would typically use an office suite for."
EASIEST ENVELOPE PRINTER I HAVE EVER USED. THANK YOU.
"The product info says,"" Norton Anti-Theft for 3-users"" yes, it will allow for 3 devices, but there is only a set up for one user and one log-in and password.
Besides the fact that it is not very accurate at locating a device, we tested it in the college library, what a joke! I do not recommend this at all, and besides that there are better, FREE anti-theft programs out there that DO work! (just search the web), this is really not worth buying."
"I have been using Kaspersky products for about 3 years now and was due for a new program as my licence on the 2011 program was expired, so i thought I would try this version which is more of an internet focused rather than an all inclusive.  For me this I hoped would be a compromise between the pop up type software and those that seem to do nothing until your already infected.  As it turns out this is my favorite Kaspersky version I have tried.

So this is a simple install on Windows 7, and it will put an over sized Icon on your desktop that looks like a little computer. It shows a green screen when all is fine and red when your attention is needed.  It has a plethora of features including mail, file, and web anti virus but also application control to limit  a programs ability to web surf or update without you knowing.  It has Firewall and network attack as well as more commonly needed features like Anti banner settings.

I can't say I have had to try to remove a virus or been attacked by one, but I think that is the whole point of using this type of software is to avoid the problem in the first place.

I can say that I like the easy interface and the way this software simply does its job without bothering me.  That in and of itself is a key feature for me.

So I do recommend this software will say I can't find a con to mention. So with that I have to say its 5 stars."
"I love Burger King. Who wouldn't want this as a gift?!? There are so many different options on the menu from coffee to dessert to your meals, anyone would like getting this as a gift!"
"Corel Painter 12 is nice, I will admit - as a long time Adobe Photoshop & Illustrator user, Corel Painter was an adjustment.  There were some key differences between the two programs that makes Corel a great piece of software, but I also must admit my machine may not be quite up to handling it....it's a decent laptop, but over 5 years old, and Painter not only took a bit to launch, but was also slow to run at times: honestly I think that was more my computer than Corel Painter 12, but I did meet the mimimum specs, so just wanted to throw that out there.  Corel is good, Corel is great, and I liked it ~ would recommend!"
"Corel Painter 11 is a somewhat souped-up version of JASC Paint Shop Pro.

I have used PSP 7 for many years while and really like it. Working with graphics is a small part of my regular work. Thanks to a good pal, I found out about PSP while it was shareware and kept up with version upgrades for a while. They were also relatively very inexpensive. Corel bought out JASC and I suppose they have improved the line, but is it a good value? I wonder. A side by side comparison looks to me like it has not changed that much over the years. The current version is very good, but I don't think it is really full-featured without having a pressure-sensitive pad system, which is easier to use than a mouse for this product. It also has some high-end system requirements, so be sure you have a PC (IBM or Apple) that meets or exceeds them.

This would be a good product for a serious computer-based painter either student or serious amateur or professional who can afford the price of both this software and a tablet."

"I too am one of those unlucky ones who spent HOURS trying to get this to install on my computer. I am a HUGE Norton fan, use their Norton 360 for some of my computers; but was thrilled that this one would go on my phone and additional computers.  It was a huge disappointment. I spent hours on the phone with customer service, only for them to call a couple weeks later and say they had fixed the kinks in it... but it still had the same issues. I honestly never tried again after that; who needs this?  I do have it on my android cell phone and it seems good but nothing fancy. Meh.  Definitely either get it off their website, or else get an actual disk.  The whole ""boxed key"" thing was an absolute nightmare."
"If you want to get a job working in an office, you really need to know how to use this program. It's fairly simple to learn and the results are amazing. There are a lot of uses for this both at home and the office. It works fine on xp and can be put on 3 computers.  I really like it that documents can be turned into pdf files.  These are so much easier to read and send than regular files and look really professional.  I like this product very much!"
"Maybe I would have liked this better if I had never used Photoshop Elements. Because I am used to PSE, I found this product difficult to use and definitely not intuitive.

It installed easily on the Mac, no problems there. Although the program has lots of capabilities, it is not as powerful as PSE. There is a learning curve that I didn't expect with what is essentially a low-end graphics editor.

This is an in-between product: Probably better than iPhoto, but nowhere near as good as Photoshop Elements."
I have been using Quicken 2011 as a beta tester for the last 2 months during the beta test period. This new version is considerably faster in saving and operations. The new Spending screens are very helpful. It is much easier to identify and fix the un-categorized transaction as well. I also use this version to track my car maintenance and repairs in a separate account and my medical expenditures complete with scanned copies of receipts in my main account file. This may seem unusual but with the enhanced search functions and reporting flexibility in Quicken I can retrieve these records very easily.

"This is not a very good program, as others have made quite clear. It consumes a great deal of time to install, does not run cleanly, and crashes constantly.

While some seem to have had a good experience with this software, I count myself among the vocal minority who were unable to make the thing run.

And my computer has a 500 Gig Seagate hard drive and 4 gigabytes of DDR3 memory. This is hardly a low end laptop, to put it mildly. I should be able to run this software, but couldn't. I junked it."
"Pointing out Word's faults is like pointing out the pyramids are crumbling--it may be true, but they're still going to be there. Still, Word's Master Document ""feature"" is still the surest way to document corruption. And you'd better track down the internet page that gives detailed instructions on the convoluted way you need to set up heading numbering if you want to keep your Word documents from corrupting.
And so on. I doubt anyone cares. Word is a fact of life, no matter if it's constantly falling to bits. The new version's XML support does give you a new path to recovering a corrupted document: saving to XML and then converting that file back to Word format has saved me some time on a couple of occasions.
We use Word because we have to. On those occasions when I don't have to, I use WordPerfect, because I like to actually produce things, not spend my time dealing with software problems."
"Back in the day I used to love Norton Utilities.  It has been about 10 years since I tried it and I was thinking that my startup was getting slow, so I decided to buy it. I found out that it didn't really help any with my startup and it was a pain in that it would delete all of my internet settings everyday.  This had some weird impacts such as my shopping sites losing my information, my browser losing my basic settings, being constantly asked if I would like the site to remember my settings, etc.  Anyway, I could extend the time between ""cleanings""  but this was the only thing besides defragging the hard drive that I could discern that the program did.  It isn't worth the trouble."

"What a great magazine...,The pictures and information  is awesome....I really have enjoyed it....,"
"First off if you use avchd (.mts) files then it is worth the upgrade with the hd plugin. Why ? Well it will actually convert your .mts files to mp4,psp,appletv, etc... straight from the raw .mts file which up to know was a total pain because you need imovieHD08 to read the avchd file then pull off the huge .mov file and then convert...
Tost9 will see the .mts file and work with it... Also the Toast Video Player will PLAY the .mts file ! Thats a first! However there is no editing that it can do so bummer there.

No the weird stuff... you are suppose to be able to take a avchd file and burn it on to a standard dvd-r for hi def playback on a bluray player... but my PS3 sees the disc as a data disc ... others have said there player sees it fine... so its not totally reliable yet... same goes for hd-dvd, I made a hi def disc on standard dvd-r and it played back wonderfully on my Toshiba A30 player but my xbox 360's hd drive hated the disc... so the same problem exists there too. If you really want to get your avchd onto dvd-r but play in hi def buy the Sony VRD-MC5 and save yourself a lot of grief.... But I hope Roxio will address these issues.

Other than that the Toast9 pretty much does what it always has done for cd burning....

I am excited about what Toast9 is trying to do to get avchd in motion so if you use these cameras this is the first real piece of software that can deal with these files (converting them) that I have seen for the Mac. iMovie08 just transcode the file to a different codec but Toast will read them and convert them straight from your hard drive as is... no camera hookup or card needed like imovie...

If it wasn't for the hiccups of bluray to dvd-r I would give it more stars. If your using Toast8 I really would not bother with Toast9. If your using avchd then its well worth the buy."

"This is the first time I've used Norton in many years - what an improvement.  Task Manager tells me it uses a little over 4,500K of memory.  That's great given that I have 4.00 GB of memory of which I can use 3.87 GB with my 64-bit Windows 7 operating system.  Norton 360 5.0 isn't slowing me down and it uses only a small fraction of a second additional time in startup.

The 360 5.0 version is consistent with trends in antivirus software.  It offers fewer choices in setup and control, intended to make installation and operation easier on most users and to guarantee some standardization of controls as required by many businesses.  It runs in the background, not affecting me except when it tells me that it detected a threat and what actions it took.

Beyond this I take precautions.  To list one, I log on as administrator only when necessary to make system changes and install software.  Precautions like that are needed because the user can feel complacent having antivirus software that runs invisibly."

"I have been using Norton products for years and have seen a continual improvement over time.  Norton 360 Multi-Device is everything I want in an Internet security program.

I got this because the subscription on my existing Norton 360 Multi-Device was ending in a few months. Once you purchase this you get a one year subscription. After the year is up you can either buy another year of service from Norton or buy the product from a third party like Amazon. In my case I was given the opportunity to review this for free through the Amazon Vine program so jumped at the chance to do so.

One of the nice features with Norton is that once installed it will always update to the latest version of the software you purchased. As a result of this there is no pressure to try the new and improved version because you are getting the newest version of the software you purchased.

When you press the Norton icon you get a screen that has security, identity, backup and tuneup options.  Each option gives you a number of choices such as when to run scans or updates or how to manage identity protection. It is easy to use and ideal for people who are not computer experts.

Norton Safe Search will also appear when I search the Internet.  There is a search box and if you go through it Norton will let you know if a site is safe or not before you go to it.

One of the things I like about Norton is there is 24 hour live free technical support available for issues with installation or product use in general. I had an issue this year that may have been virus related and I called technical support. The agent addressed my concern and thankfully it was not a virus issue.

Over the past year I have had a couple of warnings that a virus had been blocked.  I have yet to have a virus problem in the years I have been using Norton products.

When you buy a Norton product you get 365 days of updates to keep your computer protected from the latest spyware and virus threats.  I had four months of my subscription left and a Norton agent was able to add that to the year that came with this product.

When I first started using Norton many years ago I would use additional programs for added protection against spyware. I just use Norton now. I am confident that it will protect my computer from virus or spyware issues. Additionally when scans are running I can still work on my computer without everything slowing down.

Norton continues to impress me."

I do a lot of online shopping and my identity was breached several times in 2014 and 2015 when there was a major breach in several big box stores (I happened to have shopped online and in person at the very specific time dates). My credit card info was stolen and long story short I had to file a police report and a long process of disputing. Never Again. You can add this to 2 devices (including your smart phone) and I haven't taken full advantage.
"I have long been a fan of McAfee.  Occasionally, I would stray and try another product, but I always come back.  My last subscription was for McAfee Total Protection.  Aside from the interface, I can't really tell the difference.  They both protect unlimited devices.  They both track / remote lock / wipe my phones.  Neither of them make my system sluggish.  Total Protection doesn't backup to the cloud, but I don't use that.

The box came with a code printed on a card and instructions for downloading the product.  That's it.  McAfee has done a good job of streamlining the process.  Used to be a big pain to download a new edition of their software.  This time, McAfee detected that I had Live Safe two years ago, so it extended that subscription to expire next year.  I downloaded it with Total Protection still running on my computer.  I didn't have to uninstall anything.  McAfee automatically took care of it for me.

Right now, I have Live Safe on my phone and PC and I will spend the day installing it on everything else.  We have three PCs, four laptops, four cell phones, and some tablets.  Unlimited devices, yeah!

P.S.  I recommend what others have done: Buy last year's model.  You still get the latest virus protection for less."
"For home projects and web video capturing (non-YouTube), Creator 13 is decent enough to get most tasks done. I do video editing with Adobe Premiere Pro CC so I wasn't expecting a huge amount of features, but I was pleasantly surprised to see how much WAS offered when in Advanced Editing Mode... the library has quite a decent set of transitions, overlays, text editing and control of background music. Obviously there are pro features missing (such as shaping the envelope of a transition) but honestly, you can produce quite good output with the NLE. The output options are numerous too, where you can either pick a specific resolution (720, 1080) or simply pick the device that your project is intended for.

I tested the ""Create video from webpage function and it does work. The utility windows shows what video it's capturing from the webpage you are playing it on. However, bad news and this isn't Roxio's fault: it doesn't work with YouTube. YT constantly changes where temp video is staged while its playing plus they hide it deeper and deeper every month it seems. So this software won't capture YT but not many can.

The real power of Creator 13 is the media handling... you have every option to burn and copy DVDs and CDs including options to write the image to the hard drive first for more stable data (always check that box) as well as verify the disc afterwards (always do that too, although it adds time). You can open ISos and burn them right to disc, make data discs and assemble and produce audio CDs. This module alone is worth its price, not many utilities give you all of the options for  data and media handling.

Not So Good: format conversion. I took an .MP4 of a music video that was in 1080p and told Creator to convert it to iPhone 6 Plus format. When I previewed the new file the audio was out of sync. That may not happen for every format, but it'd take quite a while to test every conversion format. Since I have Adobe Media Encoder I'll use that, but for the general audience who doesn't subscribe to the Adobe tools, I'd look elsewhere for video conversion. Apple Quicktime Pro is a good start.

For the money it's a pretty good package, the file and disc handling and the web capture are the redeeming features. The Free Movie Maker on Windows along with QuickTime Pro would handle media creation and conversion but you wouldn't have the disc authoring ability (Menu page on a DVD for instance) nor the disc features, so as an all-in-one solution that won;t break the bank, this one is working well on my Windows 8.1 PC (i3 running on an SSD and 16GB ram)."
"This programs works very much like a home tax program, where it asks you questions, as if in an interview, and in doing so, you fill out the form on your PC.  When you are done, you will have a will.  You get access to some online references with this, a lay encyclopedia, but if your situation is not too complicated, this looks like it will do the trick for most of us.  I already have a will, as does my wife, but this will be a great tool to update those.  My will was done with the help of a paid attorney who does this for a living, and sure, I feel more confident in the output of that document, but after going through of this interview and filling out the questions, I do feel that the output from this willmaker is going to be good.  It has all the places for all of the people that need to sign it, just the one I did with the attorney (me, witnesses, etc.).  The trick is, when I did this with the attorney, he had all of the witnesses there to help get it all signed, but with this, I will need to make sure that is done right, not hard, just another step that is needed."
I love this cleansing cream. I also bought the body cream. Love the smell.
"Here were the ups and mostly downs of this for me.

Ups:
-Easy to load
-Forms use the traditional quicken approach of making you take a quiz and then automatically filling out the information
-Couple of the sample letters and policies were relevant to me

Downs:
- Only 2 of the forms were relevant to me running a one-member LLC that I might actually need to use one day
- Only 2 of the sample letters were ones I might use one day
- Only one of the e-library books included is one I might use one day

Caveat to my rating: I use a service very inexpensively that set up my LLC and does necessary filings for me (e.g. minutes). This may have greater value to a DIY person who hasn't yet started their own business or have a business where they sell goods, hire people and or lease out property."

"So, I thought it would be easy to use to convert our video clips from our camcorder into Facebook-ready format.

First, I opened a file to view. Looked OK, set the mark-out point. Now, how do I move it into the timeline? No obvious way to do so. After looking in vain for an icon that might say ""Add to timeline"" or something, I decided I had to move it from the thumbnail list into the timeline, which I did.

But now the preview is in low-res, and jerky to boot. I've already noticed how slow the program is to respond to moving of markers - takes 1-2 seconds to respond - but now it's even more noticeable.

Now, how to convert it to a suitable format? No obvious shortcuts for that. There are options to create DVD, Blu-Ray, etc. There's Batch Convert, but you have to select files to convert. Does this mean it'll be trimmed as I want? Dunno. ... Ah, here it is - Share tab, then Create Video File. OK, there are plenty of formats. Good. I select one and watch the low-res, jerky playback while it works. Finally, it converts, without any trouble.

If you've the patience, this program has the usual features such as tracks for effects, titles, audio, overlays, etc. as you would expect, and canned templates for authoring videos, and a good number of output formats. But dang, this thing is slow when you're positioning markers. And this is on a Dell M4400 with 4Gb RAM. Not sure whose fault it is.

Note: See Pat's warning about the ""upgrade"" and customer service in the comments."
"I always liked PaintShop instead of Elements. It does a lot, more than I will need in this lifetime. I especially like the Scratch Fixer."
This software makes Internet browsing slow down to a crawl because it's so bloated and resource intensive. Stay away and use anything else but this horrible product.
"I thought this was a great product, but many of its tools were beyond my needs and capabilities.  I am sure power users will fully realize the awesome potential of this product!"
This software does not consume resources and is quite fast.
"I've never been a fan of Norton products, but unfortunately I have to use them on several computers at work. While I don't have a formal education in computers, I've built several of them from scratch, am an early adopter of things like Vista 64-bit, and spend a lot of time reading about them. Frankly, Norton anti-virus uses so much system resources it should be classified as bloatware, or even malware.

If you want your computer to run 30% slower, buy it. If you want your computer to run 10-15% slower, buy Macafee. If you want your computer protected from viruses and to run at peak efficiency, download one of the excellent, free virus software suites that are available."
nope
as expected.
"I have used TurboTax both online and software editions for over 5 years. The online version would not allow me to import my Quicken files, so I opted for the Deluxe version with Federal and State. TurboTax is fast, quick and easy. Installation and updates were very smooth. Since I use Quicken, I love the option to import the files into TurboTax for faster and esier categoriztion. A big plus this year is the automatic import of W2 files. If you have one of the larger firms handling your company's payroll, this option is a great timesaver. It even calculates your Tax stimuluss rebate! The carryover of federal info to state is also a big plus.
The biggest Con is the EFile fee, $17.95 for both federal and state separately. This is a rip off. Efiling your federal return will speed your tax stimulus rebate (if you qualify), but it is not worth it for both. There is an option when you have completed your taxes to give your feedback in a survey and to join the TurboTax Inner Circle. I strongly suggest you do so the let Intuit know what you think of their extra charges.
Intuit makes what I think is the best tax filing software. I love having the detailed tax forms it allows you to save and print as well. If you purchase the software edition, you can import it into your Quicken file and easily update next year's edition of TurboTax. Intuit does need to do a better job of eliminating the confusing mulitple ediitons (Federal +Efile, Federal without Efile, Federal +State). They also need to be more reasonable with the Efile fee."
I have purchased this book as a gift to my sisters. I feel that it's a gift that keeps on giving all through the year.
"After tring different partitioning software i purchased this program and absolutly LOVE IT! The interface is great and it gives you a good amount of detail of your hard drive(S) that windows does not. But the greatest thing about this program is the wizards. There is a wizard for everything that you would want to do in creating, resizing, moving, formating. The wizards take you through step by step in easy to understand terms for anyone type of computer novice or expert. It makes suggestings and seys up the partition even if you want to install a second operating system (like linux or a different version of windows) and tells you why that is the best option to use. Once you deciede what you want to do it will reboot the systme and automacially start doing its job which it does faster than any other program i have used and it never damages any data you already have on your hard drive."
"Installs fine.

Uninstalls fine, after 3 hrs, due to phishing toolbar not working properly and chat room Norton Tech advising me to do so.

Does not reinstall, but gives off error popups.

Talk with Norton Techs on Chat line for 4 separate times, with no luck, besides frustration.

Norton Tech Chat Line is manned by uncourteous, non-mannered, non prepared and unknowledgeable people.  I was transfered 5 times from different tech's on 1 chat call and then hung up on.  Another tech kept asking if this was the first time I contacted the chat room, even after I said no and sent him my prior 3 chat authorization numbers for his verification. Poor Service on assistance.

I used the normal uninstall procedure and then the Norton Total Uninstall icon, both with negative results.  The registry is now splattered with Norton Reminants.

Software is now unable to be reinstalled (due to error popups), used only 3 hrs, the first night.

This Junk Software has not changed since the last time I swore I would not use it again (2004).

I hope their refund system works right!

P.S. This is a new Dell Computer I tried to install this software on.  I have no other Norton software installed or ever installed."
Have used this software for years now. My whole family does. Find it doesn't take away from the computers performance. Have kept our computers virus free.
"This is what a desktop operating system should be.  This was a part of of getting to the awesome OSX 10.10 we have now.  Great clean desktop, great user interface, solid speed and security and flawless apps and programs."
"If we could return or exchange this product, we would ... its features and pricing have been beaten like a drum, and it's spot in the marketplace superceded by numerous others.

One good example: We noticed only very recently that GMail unified its storage with Google Drive online about six weeks ago (May 2013).  Together they now offer 15 gb online storage for free.  Free to start, with an annual renewal price of free. As opposed to this product,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton-Online-Backup-2-0-1-User-25GB/dp/B002X8V326/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton Online Backup 2.0 - 1 User / 25GB</a>, priced at $25.99 for the software and first year, $19.99 renewal fee per year thereafter.  There are others, but it hardly seems fair to compare, so I'll stop right there."
