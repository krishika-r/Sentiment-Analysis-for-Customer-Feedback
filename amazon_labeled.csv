"Maybe I got an old bottle, because it's awful. I love lemon, sugar, sweet, citrus... but this combination is how air fresheners or house cleaning sprays smell. No sugar notes, no sweet notes, just lemon pledge. Which I like for my furniture, or as a dish detergent, but not on my skin.",1
"I have often heard about this type of product and I always assumed they would be lined with plastic of some kind, something non-absorbent, because otherwise, your hand cream would soak into the fabric, right?  Well, they are NOT lined with plastic, and the hand cream DID soak into them.  I put my regular application of hand cream on, and worked it in, and then, prepping for sleep, I put a big glob on my hands and rubbed it all around, sort of like you do on the face with a mask or hair with deep conditioner.  But the gloves are snug; some of the cream actually was pushed down to my wrist by the action of struggling into the gloves, and the rest of it soaked into the glove fabric once I had the gloves on.  I took them off a few minutes later because they were so tight on my hands (I wear size 7 gloves so my hands are not that outrageously big.)  As a process I don't recommend this, but if you are willing to deal with the drawbacks, you might like these.  But for me, I'll just keep moisturizing my hands before bed as usual.",1
Wow I was totally hyped to try this shower gel. According to the rate and review I thought this would be awesome. However I received the package all torn up and the bottle itself had no seal. Very disappointed,1
Too expensive for such poor quality. There was no improvement and I am starting to think my scalp is worse off than it was before I started using this product. I do agree with other reviews that it feels watered down too much. Had to use more shampoo than all other shampoo's I have tried to get a good lather.,1
Worst shampoo Ive ever used.  Was mostly water.  I could not get a good lather.  Hair never felt clean after use.  I cannot understand why so many good reviews.  Will not buy again!,1
"Selenium appeared in my search results when I was looking for an organic anti-dandruff shampoo. I was super excited to see the 5 star review. I have been struggling with dandruff for past 6 years and I was really hoping this will make a difference, atleast keep the dandruff at bay for 2 days followed by a shampoo wash with Selenium. But unfortunately, it hardly keeps dandruff at bay. And to make it worse, it makes your hair super dry.",1
"This really dries out my hair and makes it feel even thinner than it already is. The smell is nice, but consistency is pretty much water. I honestly think most of the reviews are false ",1
"Awful. Zero anti dandruff properties. Comes out of bottle like water, so very easy to waste. Very poor lathering, requires large quantity to lather up hair. Vague smell, not bad but also not pleasant.",1
"This product is a scam!  Not only does it have the consistency of water, but you need a tremendous amount for it to foam, as suggested in the instructions.  I have a shaved head and can see going through this bottle in a week or two at this pace.  To make matters worse, the my short hair was sticking up as if I had been electrocuted!  I'm going to try try this junk one more time and if I experience similar results, I'm going to try to return this trash.  BUYER BEWARE!!!",1
"I bought this shampoo because the description stated it was gentle, for itchy, red and irritated scalp. I used it one time and it burned my scalp almost immediately! I bought two bottles and I am returning them both!  I honestly don't know how it get so many good reviews.",1
"Nope. It smells like artificial bananas, and this smell does linger. It's pure liquid, there is no thickness to it at all, it's like pouring banana water on your head that lathers. It does not help with an itchy scalp either (I have psoriasis). This shampoo neither helped nor hindered my hair or scalp, made absolutely no difference (except for the banana smell). Don't waste your money.",1
I used Jan Marini eyelash intervention and my lashes were longer and noticeable. I wanted to try something else and Revitalash had a good reviews. After 3 month of everyday use there's no difference at all! Now I'm gonna try Procyde MD Lash factor if that doesn't work I'm gonna be back to Jan Marini even it's the most expensive lash conditioner.,1
"I bought this as I was really motivated by the commercials for this ""Optic White"" mouthwash. I was a victim of the promise.  Maybe it does work, but seriously, this is NASTY stuff.  NASTY.  I would force myself to use it (white teeth=life's problems solved!), but then end up spitting it out short of ten seconds.  I hate that I bought a four pack and am stuck with two unopened bottles.

I'm not a wimp with flavors, but this is gross. Hate.",1
"Williams Lectirc Shave is a great product that has served men's electric shaving needs for several decades!  BUT DON'T buy it here!  WHY?  I didn't pay close enough attention to the prices vs weight and when it arrived I was really angry!  This is the 3 ounce travel bottle that you can sometimes find in you local drug store for about $2.50, NOT $5.62!!!  For $5.48 - $5.85 you can buy the 7 ounce bottle at every drugstore in your town or on line at CVS.com or Drugstore.com or any other online national drug store chain.  DON'T GET RIPPED OFF BY THIS SELLER!!  YOU ARE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR WHAT YOU GET! THE PRICE SHOULD BE FOR THE 7 OUNCE BOTTLE AND NOT THE 3 OUNCE BOTTLE.  RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"Be careful, NewAir will not stand by their products. Our NewAir broke within the first 4 hours of use.  The manufacturer will NOT cover the item under warranty. Just in case you're actually thinking of buying a NewAir product... think twice...

Hi Susan,

The manufacturer warranty is void if the unit is purchased by a private seller who does not have our consent to sell our products. This is the same reason why we ask for a copy of your receipt upon requesting warranty claims because if it not from a valid authorized dealer we will not proceed with warranty work. We also list our authorized dealers on our web site for customer use. We stand behind our products, however when an item is purchased from a private seller the purchaser runs the risk of the item being used, open box, refurbished, and or a scratch and dent. Our one year limited manufacturer's warranty is only valid on new items sold by our authorized online dealers. It is unfortunate to see that you are in this situation, however you will need to contact the seller of the item for a replacement or refund.

Have a great day!

Hello Mireya-

I'm sorry but I thought the manufacturer warranty was for the manufacturer, NewAir.  Please explain why the warranty is not valid in this case.  I don't see anywhere in the warranty exclusions that the warranty is not valid if not purchased from an authorized dealer.  In addition, a consumer would never know who ""authorized dealers"" are because if a company is selling your product doesn't that implicitly make them authorized to do so?

I sincerely hope that NewAir will reconsider this position and stand by the integrity of their products.  This ice machine was literally used for four hours before failing and it is, quite frankly egregious that your company is negating a warranty that explicitly states it will repair or replace defective materials or workmanship for up to one year.

Please let me know how I can talk to a dispute department regarding this matter.  I look forward to your response and I will refrain from giving any reviews of your product until this matter is resolved.

Thank you,
Susan Ferguson

Hi Susan,

Unfortunately, the ice maker was not purchased from an authorized dealer. You will need to contact the seller ""Mehadrin"" through Amazon for any existing issues on your unit.

Hello-  I received an AI-100S icemaker in March 2014.  I used it one time and within 4 hours the cooling unit had shut down.  My best estimate is that the pump was still working (the water was getting pumped through) but the cooling mechanism was not.  When I plugged the unit back in to try it a few hours later, the cooling mechanism never turned on.

Since this product is still under warranty, I am hoping to acquire a new unit since this particular one has essentially never been used and is obviously faulty in some capacity.

I have attached the receipt for your reference.  It was purchased as a gift through Amazon Marketplace.  Thanks so much and I look forward to your response.

"We would give less than 1 star if possible DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  The ice machine stopped working four hours after we used it the first time.

Just like posting reviews on that large movie streaming company that's name starts with an ""N"" and ends with an ""X"". My recommendation is don't buy it.",1
What a rip off! This deal of the day started and within 1 minute it was sold out. I added it to my cart and before I could even hit the checkout it was sold out.

I just placed my order for another gift card and I hope that arrives with the $50.00 balance that it's supposed to have.

Upon arrival at a local Olive Garden branch in October 2014, my friends and I saw only a few customers sit there so we should be assigned a seat quickly. There were several welcoming representatives just talking to each other and one told us that we had to wait at least 20 minutes to get seated.

After the dirty and sour meal, we were overcharged and were forced to pay 20% service fee as tips. If it's a good meal and service, we might pay more than 30% of dinner price as tip but we had a horrible dining experience in Olive Garden. After all, we would never visit Olive Garden again because such a bad restaurant kept ripping people off. I have seen bad reviews on this restaurant from other people on other sites too.",1

"Maximum PC's slogan is Maximum PC. Minimum BS. Well I think they should make that, Half PC. Half BS. If you buy your subscription on here, you're not getting the CD, which is obviously, the whole essence of the mag. The CD is done just like PC Gamer, but it just has Maximum PC on there, instead of PC Gamer, and this also means, if your PCG CD's won't auto-load, neither will the MPC ones. Since I can't see what the price is for the subscription on here, I cant tell if you're paying the same amount on here for the no CD sub, as you would with the CD. CD sub. price is $29.95. You can obviously look at the top of the page, and see what the price is. The one good thing they have is the Head 2 Head thing they have in the beginning, where they pit two products against each other. This month it was Yahoo! Mail vs. Hotmail.

(And for more on that, read my review...if it ever gets posted).",1
"When I was a little kid in the 1950s and 1960s, PopSci was the one magazine I looked forward to every month. Each thick issue was full of articles on everything from the latest scientific breakthroughs to gadgets you could build in your basement shop. They commissioned vacation home designs from architects, told you how to build a radio, and helped you maintain your car (anyone remember Smokey's Garage?)

Today's PopSci is 90 pages of brief essays, and there's nothing here you can't find by browsing a few web pages like Engadget, Science Daily, and yes, PopSci's own website. Instructables has more projects than you'll find a a year of PS.

But that's the way the world is going. WIth so many general and special interest web sites out there providing the same information, and often breaking stories the day they come out, there's not really a place for a brief collection of technology stories that has to be assembled several months in advance.

Update: I just received the latest (9/2015) issue, via a free subscription, and it's now down to 82 low density pages. About half the pages contain editorial material, but there's precious little information.there are, however, several full-page portraits of the subjects of a few of the articles, and a double page spread of Neil DeGrasse Tyson in a rubber apron with a goofy look. The ""projects"" contain insufficient information to build, the articles are superficial, and the interviews ar at most a few hundred words. My copy went into the recycling bin after a cursory look through.",1
"I subscribe to many outdoor themed magazines and have to say that I have never seen a magazine take such a dive in quality as quickly and drastically as this.  Gone are the great tales of survival and adventure (except in one issue per year).  Instead the magazine is filled with dozens of glossy photos of males modeling overpriced clothing.  Add to this the sheer volume of advertisements and you have very little left for stories or expeditions.  Most of the travel notes are for places that cost terribly much money and would be better represented in Conde Naste or National Geographic Traveler.

For true outdoor enthusiasts I recommend Runners World (it is geared towards running but does feature some great product reviews), Trail Running, and National Geographic Adventure.  Outside magazine is obviously a marketing outlet and I am sure they make big income from the obviously biased product reviews and destination write ups.  I understand this is how the world works... but I will find other sources for my outdoor fix... such as actually going outdoors.  This is not the magazine for true outdoor enthusiasts, but for those who want to dream about buying the gear and never actually using it.

Update:

So I'm not on an auto renewal plan or anything, but I have been getting this magazine for about 3 years now... and it's followed me to my new apartment without me submitting a new address! (Seriously, they are printing my new address - not the post office stickers!).  I think that maybe because I don't really want the magazine, some karmic force out there is punishing me with free issues!  At least my apartment workout room is getting some literature, because it goes from my mailbox, right into the magazine holder there.",1

"Maxim rode the men's magazine gold rush in the late 1990s, leading Stuff, FHM and a host of other PG-13 fare that filled the convenience store racks as Playboy, Penthouse and the hard cores were either dropped completely or were tucked behind the clerk hidden behind individual black plastic wrappers.

Maxim is the last Laddie still in print in the U.S., having witnessed the print burials for FHM (1996 to 2007) and Stuff (1998 to 2007). Maxim's putrefaction is evident to its subscribers, hence the heavily discounted subscriber rates available today. If you were unfortunate enough to receive a gift subscription to Maxim or, worse yet, bought one for yourself, you can no doubt bear witness to the decay. The magazine simply isn't interesting or compelling to read. You could find more of everything - women, entertainment, food and fashion - in a 10-minute Google search.

"Update: Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch has just purchased National Geographic.  Do not trust the content from here forward.  He is planning to turn the magazine and society into a for profit organization in order to hide science and progress under the guise of a 'scientific journal'.

E-mail and cancel your subscriptions and send a message to this tyrant!  We want science and fact - not fiction and skewed articles serving right wing, mega corporate interests!!!

For a little while I was confused with the article selections.  It seemed they were picking some pieces that weren't really about geography, sociology, or history.  More like current events.  But the last year or two they have been on track with solid stories and spectacular photography.

I was more impressed with Smithsonian for awhile, but their new format is laughable (you can read my updated 3 star review at the Amazon listing:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smithsonian-1-year-automatic-renewal/dp/B0032KHQU2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smithsonian (1-year automatic renewal)</a>.  National Geographic has taken its place as top world history/sociology magazine again.

The stories may be less fleshed out than some other magazines.  These guys are definitely about the pictures.  But the pictures usually serve a purpose. They aren't just glossy and pretty.  Looking in a recent issue about global warming and population increase in Bangladesh, the pictures illustrate the point of the story: the struggles of many impoverished citizens in a country in the grip of climate change.

The stories have gotten less 'preachy' and don't tend to berate folks for not doing everything they can to help those in need.  Instead the stories tend to show both outlooks on a divided issue without painting one in a bad light.  Of course, the reader can usually infer from the nature of the story the outlook that Nat Geo favors.  It is a highly liberal magazine focused on conservation, but that is what they have been about for years, so it shouldn't surprise anyone.

I highly recommend this magazine for those folks looking for great stories on a variety of topics pertaining to nature, history, and people.",1
"Warning -- If you are looking for the Prevention Magazine that you remember reading back in the 1970's or 1980's -- THIS ISN'T IT!

Gone are the wonderful articles on health by way of the PREVENTION of disease, replaced by advertisements for DRUGS and useless ""fashion magazine"" type stories that are filled to the brim with NOTHING of any value to the astute reader. The original publisher of Prevention must have run into financial difficulties, and perhaps sold the name to another company. This magazine bears absolutely no resemblance to the informative, educational publication it once was. I noticed years ago that it started slipping in the value of information presented, but this is just a joke! I'd compare it to a print version of all those endless commercials on TV for perscription medications, showing young, hip people in positive situations, while a voice-over drones on with an endless list of side-effects including death.

If you are looking to educate yourself about the prevention of disease, by all means avoid this useless publication. It is completely without value, unless you happen to have a short leg on your coffee table.

Yes, it's that bad. Stay away!",1
"There is very little about simplifying your life in this magazine, it is mostly about rampant consumerism; I am not saying there is anything wrong with consumerism, it is great for our economy, but it should be labled as such, not wrapped up in a false guise with a silly label.
Hidden between a forest of ads, you will find the occasional spindly little article, and chances are, that article will also be selling you S.T.U.F.F. with clever product placement.
The ads, which are quite wide-ranging in whatever the target audience is supposed to be, made me dazed and confused, and my nose was not pleased either, as some of them contain ""perfume"".
As for the ""tips"", not all are helpful. They suggest for instance, that you hard boil eggs, and keep them for a week in the refrigerator (page 18, November 2003 edition). True, a week is the limit for storing hard cooked eggs, and they will not kill you, but have you ever eaten an egg that has been sitting in the fridge for seven days ? It is enough to put one off the incredible edible forever. Five days is max folks, for a decent tasting egg.
The paper quality is quite good, with a matte finish, but if you want substance, and really inventive ideas, look elsewhere.",1
"To begin with, I am not much into fashion, so take that into consideration while reading my review. I grew up in the mid-west, where for most people considering we are surrounded by corn fields and our communities are filled with farmers, comfort is more important than fashion. You are more likely to see farm and home stores than fashion stores. Anyway, this was only $5 so I took a chance on ordering it along with several other magazines (which I have a surplus of and am currently behind on reading lol) and this is one of the only ones that even though it is only $5, I had to cancel even if they didn't refund me. I just did not want this coming to my house every month. It is a thick magazine which is good and bad, but one issue was like an encyclopedia. When I started flipping through the pages, MOST of it was ads for products and designers. Just women posing in silly clothes and makeup. The articles, to me, were boring, bland, and not relevant to my life or interests. I read one article where a woman struggled with her appearance because she was Jewish and had a big nose and whatever and it made me kinda sad that she couldn't accept herself for such a long time. Everyone is beautiful in different ways and magazines like ELLE present a culture of one kind of beauty which really isn't beautiful. It's fake and kind of scary. So I just did not want this magazine in my house. I am sticking with more down to earth magazines. I enjoy a range of health magazines, home and family magazines, and girly magazines that aren't quite so fashion centered. Again, this is my opinion so please don't criticize me. I understand location has a lot to do with how you view fashion and body image but I am perfectly happy with me!

Update: I'm glad some people are finding my review helpful! I also forgot to mention that my mom (a woman in her 50's) exchanges magazines with me and this magazine has very small print which made the magazine hard for her to read. And I flipped through the last issue I received and most of the articles (at the end of the magazine since the first half of it is full of ads) were about feminism. I am not a feminist and that's as far as I'll go on that subject. You can formulate your own opinion of the articles. Just pointing it out to potential subscribers since I had no idea what to expect from this magazine. Another article in this magazine was defending photo shop and feeding false body images to women as artwork like it is no big deal! I was shocked because it contributes to eating disorders and low self esteem in many women, especially young women. A better name for this magazine would be SUPERFICIAL.",1
"Scientific American was once the premier scientific journal for the educated reader with an interest in science. Every article was written by a researcher in that field, and nothing was dumbed down. Every October, SciAm published a special issue that covered just one topic in depth, and these special issues presented the state of the art in that area in a way that was readable and understandable to the non-specialist, but at the same time could have served as a text for the student in that area. Some of those special issues were re-published as book, and when I was a grad student, the special issue on The Brain was actually used as a text for one of my seminars.

Today's SciAm is a sad, pale, echo of that once great journal. Most of the pieces are short, superficial, one or two page essays that can be quickly skimmed over. Much of the content deals with policy issues, not the underlying science. And whereas mathematics is the common language of science, the tool that (as a friend once remarked) keeps scientists honest, there's not a whisper of it in today's SciAm- a particularly sad thing given that one of the most popular features in the old SciAm was Martin Gardner's column on recreational mathematics! Gone also is the Amateur Scientist, a section in which serious amateurs would present their research programs, complete with detailed drawings of apparatus. It was here I first read about experimental rocketry, constructing computers (in the 1960s!) and building telescopes.

When I was a student in middle school, forty years ago, I found much of the math daunting, but that only spurred me on to study more and learn the tools that would unlock the knowledge found in the articles. Today, it's a magazine that  requires nothing of the reader. Facts are presented in a superficial way as absolute truths, and the magazine is designed to be skimmed over, and discarded. A sad end to a once great journal.",1
"This magazine, as I already knew, is just about sex. I really don't know why women like to read this, and especially why parents allow their children to read this magazine! It only encourages them to be sexually active and experiment with boys. I read an article online that a woman is trying to get news stands to sell this magazine in a plastic bag so that young women cannot read it's contents at the store! I do not enjoy reading this magazine. I only tried it because I knew it was so popular among women and wanted to see why. I also was not happy with the customer service. My magazine took forever to come in the mail and I just decided to cancel it because of the delay in shipping and the content is smut! I can spend my $15 on a much better magazine.

One more thing: If you have allergies, BEWARE! I had to pull out at least 5 or more perfume inserts and the magazine still smelt like perfume! You may want to consider this before it ends up in your mailbox and you have an asthma attack trying to read it!",1
"""The Cosmo Sex Poll - 6,000 Horny Guys Tell All"" is an actual title from the August Cosmo issue (I'd be more interested to learn how they determined the guy was horny before letting him take the poll ;o) )

I used to be an avid Cosmo reader in my 20's. Life got busy in my 30's, but, I have recently decided to re-subscribe. I am sad to report that the magazine has slipped considerably in general quality of information provided, as well as the manner in which it is done. I was looking forward to hot-off-the-press fashion news; I wanted to learn about the best beauty products on the market; I wanted to read stories relevant to my life with real life heroines who inspire other real life women. Well, it was not to be. What I got was a little bit of fashion and beauty with the rest being a poorly written sex manual. Oh, ""how to manipulate your man"" was also high on the magazine's agenda... Here are some titles from the August issue:

""She Had Her First One Night Stand at 34"" (she's for it and it's in the Need to Know section of the magazine...)
""Secrets His Sex Style Reveals""
""Guys Rate 125 Sex Moves""
""Get Hit On All The Time""
""Orgasm Whisperer""
""First Time Sex Bloopers""
""Cosmo's Naughty Sex Dare Game""

I could go on, but I am feeling noxious again...It's rather disturbing that teenagers and young women are reading this and may be getting the idea that this is all their life is supposed to be about: having sex, all the time, with strangers, as well as manipulating men... Sad...

If you are looking for magazines with fashion/beauty focus, I recommend: In Style, Style Watch, and Lucky.

Regarding Cosmo subscription service: I received the Sept issue promptly, FOLLOWED by the August issue (they were clearing out their warehouse, I guess...).",1
"The best thing I can say about this magazine is that I didn't have to pay for the subscription; I bought it with air miles. Good thing, too, because this magazine is NOT worth its price, either off-the-rack or via subscription.  Want to keep up with your favorite celebrities? The ""news"" in this magazine is nothing more than a collection of rumors.  Want fashion advice? The most you'll get here are photos of celebs wearing something and what it is.  Most of the fashions and cosmetics are, of course, waaayyy out of the price range of the average reader.

The stories are rumors you can get much cheaper via supermarket tabloids, or ""quotes"" from a ""source"" that's supposedly ""close"" to the celebrity, or paragraphs of what the person ""might"" do, based on trends or what their celeb pals have done in the past.  Usually these are incorrect.  A few months ago I the magazine gushed about Princess Kate's pregnancy with twins, and how Buckingham Palace ""should confirm"" it soon.  Today the cover squeals that Kate and her sister Pippa are both pregnant, Kate with a girl and Pippa with a boy.  I won't hold my breath over it.

Subscribe to US or PEOPLE if you want intelligently-written articles about celebs and others in the news.  The magazines don't source stories on gossip and rumor, and are written by reliable reporters instead of paparazzi, which I suspect is the case here.  OK! was anything but, and I'm sorry I wasted air miles on it.",1
"This magazine is such a disappointment now.  When I subscribed, it was what the title proclaimed.  Great!  They'll sift thru the site and choose recipes many folks would like; and bring to the readers' attention unusual recipes they have missed on the site.

Then they started adding ads.  No problem and no surprise.  How else could they continue?

THEN...they started adding other stuff!  In my Feb-Mar 2018 issue, the first recipe didn't appear until pg. 36 (out of 104 pgs., mind you).  And what was this stuff?  Fitness, lifestyle, tablescapes, kitchens renovations, utensils, baking with kids, and choosing healthy snacks (plus ads).  FINALLY, we got a recipe!

If I wanted all that ""stuff"", I'd subscribe to a mag that does it well (such as MARTHA STEWART LIVING).  And, in fact, I do subscribe to MSL.  AR does not do this sort of thing well, at all.

I will NOT be re-subscribing to Allrecipes.  It has turned into something unlike its charter.  A very big disappointment.  If you want recipes without extraneous barely-related material, AR is not for you.

PS.  TASTE OF HOME used to be ""no-advertising,"" too, but they had to add it to survive.  They've avoided padding their content, however.  AR should take a lesson.",1
"I have had a subscription for decades and used to read it religiously but no more.  Their articles used to be about men and their hobbies, careers, travels, explorations, health, toys, etc., and it was worth reading.  Over recent years though they have gotten too political, liberal, and left wing.  I began to notice it when they took every opportunity to criticize President George W. Bush who was pretty manly and outdoorsy.  Then along came their idol obama who they drooled over in every issue,  They put him on the cover that stated Barack Obama, Jock in Chief (oh please), and then wrote about Barack Obamas Next Level Retirement of which the authors were jealous.  And then the people of America elected President Donald J. Trump and every single issue has at least one and often more negative comments about him.  Someday they might realize that all of their readers are not liberal snowflakes but I doubt it.  My subscription expires this month and that is it.  No more mens journal coming before my eyes.",1
"After years of waiting for Intuit to issue a proper upgrade of Quicken for Mac 2007 with cross-platform compatibility to its Windows range, I gave up in late 2012. I migrated all my financial data to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/iBank-4/dp/B003WT1KAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">iBank 4</a>, a far more full-featured and better-supported application. The tipping point was to be told in October 2012 by Intuit not only that there is still no full upgrade to Quicken for Mac 2007, but also that as I'm not a US resident Intuit would not even provide me with the Mac OS X 10.7 Lion-compatible version of Quicken for Mac 2007 from the PowerPC version (16.0.2.- R3) I had been using!

I was a long-term user of Quicken, with 14 years of financial data recorded in it from June 1998 to October 2012.  I had been using both Macs and PCs (Macs preferred) since 1984. I migrated my financial data to Quicken in 1998 from an earlier Mac personal accounting application called Dollars & $ense, from a company called Monogram which went out of business about the same time their product succumbed to the Y2K bug.

Intuit long has had a popular and evidently well-supported financial software range for Windows, but its product development and support for the Mac platform went into terminal decline after 2007. Its support and customer service for Mac users now have degraded to a point of non-existence or uselessness. What totally impenetrable thinking led Intuit to this incredible outcome?  The answer is a mystery. Would Microsoft throw away its market advantage by failing to maintain cross-platform compatibility between Mac and Windows versions of MS Office, or Adobe its cross-platform compatible market dominance in imagery and PDF processing? No way!

When the initially excellent Quicken for Mac 2007 started showing its age, Intuit engaged in some two years of beta-testing and consultation with the Mac-user community.  This was among the largest scale, most hyped beta-testing and consumer consultations ever for any Mac product. It turned out that the long promised, much hyped Quicken Mac upgrade was nothing but vaporware. The only result was a dumbed-down standalone product, so-called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quicken-Essentials-for-Mac-Download/dp/B003PDMNCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quicken Essentials for Mac  [Download</a>], the exact opposite of everything that the Mac-user community told Intuit we need!  Is it any wonder that we Mac users feel that Intuit has treated us with contempt?

Intuit's failure to build on its market potential with Mac users is a tragedy and farce. I highly recommended Quicken for Mac 2007 in earlier times when it was justly the market leader. Now, sadly, I must strongly recommend that Mac users avoid the product and its makers.

More than seven years now have passed since this last release of Quicken for Mac, in August 2006. Intuit never updated this out-of-date product -- merely patched it two or three times when its bugs and incompatibilities stopped it working in new versions of Mac OS X. Since 2010 Intuit has not even updated its only other personal finance software for Mac, the absurdly named&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quicken-Essentials-for-Mac-Download/dp/B003PDMNCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quicken Essentials for Mac  [Download</a>], a downgrade of Quicken for Mac which has even fewer essential features than its obsolete predecessor.

What on earth has been going on at Intuit that it has abandoned Mac product development? My best guess is that some totally unrealistic and irrational feedback, typically from a small number of noisy Mac personal finance users, has convinced Intuit that we Mac users are just creative types and airheads with no grasp of the mathematical logic, rational thinking and work discipline required to use full-featured personal financial accounting.

The unreasonableness of some customer negative feedback on personal finance software would be enough to alienate the most helpful software developers. Typically, the noisiest unreasonableless ranges across complaints about non-core, third party functions like bank downloads; blaming software for user error, or the consequences of user failure to read user manuals or to follow simple universal accounting principles. Has this unreasonableness convinced not only Intuit, but also other personal finance software makers, that we Mac users are financial and computer illiterates not worth their time and trouble? Could the impossible-to-satisfy high maintenance demands of financially illiterate customers also explain why even Microsoft never released its former personal finance product, Microsoft Money, for Mac -- and discontinued it for Windows in 2009?

Since migrating from Quicken for Mac 2007 to iBank in 2012, I am now in my third year with iBank. I highly recommend the current version&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/iBank-5-Download/dp/B00GUXLRCQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">iBank 5 [Download</a>] to all Mac users who are unafraid of the tiny amount of work, rational thinking and user manual reading necessary for serious, accurate personal finance recordkeeping. iBank's makers, IGG Software (with whom I have no association, except as a satisfied paying customer) specialize only in personal finance software for the Mac OS and portable iOS devices, iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch.

I have almost 16 years of continuous, detailed, accurate data in iBank. This is the best move I ever made in personal finance recordkeeping -- but the most unrealistic, unreasonable and absurd remarks I ever have seen about personal finance software continue to flow in attacks on iBank. Among the most absurd claims is that either of the two outdated Quicken personal finance products is as good as, or better than, the state-of-the-art iBank software, which has had more feature-rich updates in the past year than both Quicken Mac products in their combined lifetimes. This is not a matter of opinion or taste: it is objective fact about all the long list of capabilities iBank has, which are lacked by the Quicken Mac deficient duo.

In these days of widespread fake review writing, star ratings averaged from total positive or negative reviews in Amazon are less trustworthy than ever for product evaluation. Unfortunately, there is no certain method for distinguishing a merely silly or misinformed review from a fake. Significantly, a much higher proportion of helpful customer votes (far more difficult to fake than reviews) appears in Amazon on substantiated, detailed and factual positive reviews of iBank than on negative reviews and comments. The distribution of helpful votes gives the most accurate picture of what the Amazon customer community really thinks about products. It is unsurprising to find, on this measure, that Amazon customers rate an Intuit product,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quicken-Essentials-for-Mac-Download/dp/B003PDMNCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quicken Essentials for Mac  [Download</a>], the worst of all personal finance software -- not only for the Mac OS, but for Windows, Unix and *all* operating systems.",1
"Update 3: 06-04-2010  My xp machine at work was having problems and before I did anything, I UN-installed
PDF coverter pro 5. [as per Nuance instructions]

I ran a repair on windows and everything was running fine again.

I RE-installed pdf converter pro and crap!  When I went to activate, it said I had activated this copy of pdf converter pro 5 the maximum number of times....blah...blah....blah...

Here we go again.

Then it offered me a button to click on to BUY the program?????

I went over to ebay and picked up NITRO PDF 6, on a charity auction for like $40 (w/free S&H)

I tried a few pdf creations and a few pdf conversions with NITRO PDF 6 and so far it looks to work just as good, or better, than nuance's pdf product.

I'll contact Nuance about the problem by fax (can't seem to reach them any other way without PAYING for assistance. If their !#@!$$#@^%  product wasn't such a PITA, no one would have to contact them).

Needless to say, I downgraded this product's rating to a single star.

Update 2: 04-04-2010. Reinstallation of XP operating system CRIPPLED by nuance trying to revalidate license CONSTANTLY during the reinstall of XP.

My XP MCE 2005 operating system lost access to it's HAL.DLL file, requiring a reinstall of the OS.

This PITA pdf converter lost it's ability to validate it's license and CONSTANTLY preempted my
XP reinstall attempts.
Two attempts at removing the pdf converter still did not stop it from trying to validate it's license.
Even used JVPOWERTOOLS 2009, to remove EVERY registry entry for pdf converter AND nuance; still invaded my reinstall of XP.
It got so crippling that I simply used a new hard drive, initialized it and did a clean install of XP; then transferred data/user files afterward.

The validation process they use is a real PITA.

I'd gladly pay (...) or even (...) to just get a USB security dongle , so they can get rid of that
USELESS license verification process, built into their product.

Nuisance (oops, nuance) has NO fallback for those times you must do a clean install on your OS,
(AND are unable to access your OS in order to UNinstall their product ""Prior to"" the OS reinstall).

------------------------------------------
Update 11-01-2009  Be forewarned about activation & loss of product usage.

------------------------------------------
Attention !!!! WARNING !!!!

Nuance does things a lot different with their product's installation & activation.
A couple re-installs of your windows operating system due to windows issues; and/or a couple hardware upgrades like new video card or new hard drive, and PDF converter 5 could cease to function.

My installation had this problem recently.
At almost (...), you expect a program to function 24/7/365.
When mine stopped working, it really interrupted my work production.

So,
If you have this software installed and want to upgrade/changed ANY internal PC hardware, you MUST uninstall the pdf converter pro 5 software
""BEFORE you make ANY hardware changes"" !!!

NOTE: UNinstalling the program in effect ""DE-activates"" your pdf converter pro 5.
Thus ""releaseing"" the license key and this doesn't count against your
""5 license activations"", before product QUITS working!

I work with pc hardware and do pc repairs/upgrades 40+ hours a week.

On my work PC, I have upgraded my mobo 3 times this year. My hard drive twice.
(one of the perks of being the IT helpdesk guy) (last update was to an Intel i7 Core.)

Recently I had lost windows booting abilities, so I installed a newer, larger, hard drive.
So I installed the brand new hard drive and did a clean XP Pro installation.

As soon as I loaded PDF Converter 5 Pro, it wanted to activate.

Then it went online a few seconds and then an error window popped up saying I had exceeded the 5 activation allowances that Nuance allows.

I emailed Nuance the details.
I mentioned how I own 4 retail box copies of this s/w.

After going back and forth with support, they re-activated my license number.

But I could not make PDF files or about 2 days.

*****How to prevent this from happening again?****

If you are using PDF converter 5 on your PC, then ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS
do an UNinstall before changing ANY pc hardware.

The activation process takes serial numbers from the internal components and uses them for activation calculations. (probably the serial # of mobo and/or hard drives).

When a serial number changes due to new hardware, the s/w launches another activation attempt.
Five activations are allowed before the s/w is disabled.

You MUST UNistall the software before doing hardware upgrades, to keep the activation counter from decrementing one of the 5 activation allowances.

This is the sort of thing that should be listed on a neon colored label, on the CD's paper sleeve or jewel case. And/or on the box it comes in.
I told Nuance this, but I doubt they'll do anything about it.

Unforunately, it is not like there are a lot of choices for the
combination software of PDF maker with a PDF converters.

You have:
1. Nuance pdf conveter pro 5
2. Nitro pdf.
3. PDF tools [by solid documents]

Adobe's acrobat pdf maker is pricey and has no conversion abilities. It only creates PDFss.

Other single function s/w conveters are:

Able2extract
Docudesk
PDF conveter elite

Oh, and as far as product functionality, this software does okay.

PDF to word conversions do okay with text; but sort of crappy with images.
(But it seems to be this way with all pdf converter applications).

------------------------------------------------------------
I'm on day 1 of using this software.

Creating a PDF is working fine.

Converting an existing PDF to MS Word is working fine, so far.

Converting an existing PDF with a table inside it; into MS excel is working OK, so far.

Annoyances/problems:

1. After installing software onto my PC, an annoying ""activation"" NAG screen keeps popping up everytime/anytime I launch the program and/or toggle between CREATING a PDF vs CONVERTING a PDF.
Plus it decrements from 30 uses to none.

So off I went to ACTIVATE this whiner!

2. Activation:

a. I just went online, registered,  and then activated it, but apparently it requires further  MANUAL intervention by the enduser (lazy programmers at Nuance).
Because I am still getting the pop-up about not being activated.

b. License key & activation problems:
The setup/installation onto your PC works just fine with numbers and LOWER case letters . [For entering the alpha-numeric license code during installation of the software onto your PC].

But as soon as you get to Nuance's website and try to activate/register,
by using their ""Paste-serial-number-from-clipboard"" button, you get an error!
These boneheads keep kicking back your serial number as INCORRECT until you make it ONLY numbers and only ""UPPER case"" letters.
(why doesn't Nuance spend  a couple bucks on a 5 minute programming ""FIX""  and let the stinking webpage AUTO correct a small issue like these)

Next, trying to correct a serial number which was already ""pasted"" into the Nuance webform box [but contained lower-case letters]. Whenever I'd click my mouse next to a lower case letter and try to CHANGE it to an UPPERcase letter, a wretched pop-up window keeps WHINING about using ""The PASTE button function only"".
For every 1 lower-case letter you try to change to upper-case; you have to answer 2 pop-up windows and make them go away.
[Hey tightwads, fix your website's serial number entry form).
[Go to Elance and hire a programmer for (...) an hour and FIX the problem with ""YOUR"" [NUANCE's] website]

I tried to be  nice  and contact Nuisance (whoops, I mean Nuance) about their problem.
(Starting off an end-user experience like this is NOT going to endear me to rush out and buy any more NUANCE products; especially  if they can't make the registration & activation process easier, functional and more streamlined)

Here's a frustrating experience; Just try contacting these Tight-fisted pukes with a simple FYI, to tell them about a website issue of their's.

These pukes  expect you to shell out (...) per incident  just to contact them.
Sorry dudes, I'm not paying to fix YOUR website problems.

SUMMARY:

Pros - products looks/acts OK so far.
  - cheaper than Adobe

Cons - Just hope you NEVER need to contact NUANCE for ANYTHING.
Or I should say; PLAN to NEVER contact them.
[you can't even throw them a bone about how to improve their website without getting hit up for (...)]
 -poor activation web setup
 - Deceptive/hidden cost details about tech support :
  - no mention on software box
  - no mention inside box, nor in User manual

I bought this program for myself.
Once I test-drove it awhile, I was going to make recommendations to a large client about maybe switching to Nuance (from Adobe).
I really have my doubts now; especially regarding their ""nickel & dime-ing"" attitude toward their end-users.

09-24-2008 update:

I tried converting a bunch of pdf's to word, so i can work with the data within the pdf's.

The program goes fairly fast through the conversion process, until you reach 99%. Then it sits there for what seems like an eternity.

My core-2-duo is not pegged for CPU usage (only 25-50%), but the hard disk light is almost solid.

I found that this program really has a hard time with any text within a book's front cover. Mostly comes out as a mangled mess.
The text pages are decent in the translation.
But plan to run auto-format within Word, to get things cleaned up.",1
"When Quicken goes under, I'm going to wear a pink tuxedo to the funeral.

[These comments are based on my continuing nightmare of lousy experiences with Quicken Deluxe 2008. This software, which has been getting continually worse since 2002, couldn't have possibly improved since then ... ]

For me Quicken 2008 was a forced/hostage upgrade from Quicken 2005. You ""have"" to upgrade since they've cut a deal with the financial institutions to cut off your online access with the institutions if you don't upgrade every three years. Just as found when I was hostage upgraded in 2005 from 2002, there's nothing more than a cosmetic face-lift, no meaningful fixes/improvements -- but there's even more bugs, problems and aggravation.

* Product now will not connect properly to Fidelity; no problem under 2005.

* Took forever to figure out how to turn off a ""reminder"" function ... that kept reminding me to pay bills already scheduled to be paid using the auto-pay function. 2005 did the same thing and it's not been fixed.

*You can turn off the product registration nag screen ... if you Google to find out how. Product does not have to be registered to use it.

* Un-reconciles accounts six months back every once in a while. I've been assuming that's being caused by a few bytes of bad data that occasionally comes from the financial institutions ... that the Quicken people have not properly coded so as to filter out. This bug also surfaced in 2005. Two weeks into 2008, I've seen it again already.

* You can't turn off the ""free update/revision"" nag screen unless you take the update. No such nag screen in 2005.

* When connecting, the completion screen used to show which accounts had new transactions to match and had convenient buttons next to each to take you directly to the account. Gone in 2008. Now I have to look through every account each time to see where transactions might have been retrieved.

* Icons everywhere attempting to peddle other unwanted Quicken products. One of the 'product improvements' in 2008.

* Doesn't handle stock distributions correctly (since they were not actually paid for); keeps generating error messages when you enter the correct posting of no cost incurred. Same problem in 2005.

* Tricky screens/checkboxes/prompts that try to bait you into using/enrolling for QuickenDot services when you don't have to or need to. Users that did so now post complaints they can't undo it and that the QuickenDot server is constantly down, causing problems/delays when trying to connect to other accounts using a one-step update.

Yet another company that's grown totally complacent about product quality while wallowing in its assured-for-the-moment revenue stream. It will bite them hard in the long-run. Postings indicate similar complaining regarding the major competitor product, Microsoft Money. If history is any lesson, there's no reason to suspect that these software products will ever get better under these conditions. Some other product will have to steal their customer base before they wake up and smell the coffee.

If you are not already committed to either of those two products, take a good long look at open source software such as GNU Cash.

[Update: April 15, 2008] Does now connect to Fidelity ... occasionally. When I opened the portfolio area today, the entire computer screen flashed with confusion and the product crashed. 2005 never once crashed. Still flashing but no subsequent crashes. Who knows what happened. Not me. Apparently not Quicken programmers either.

[Update: July 12, 2008] Connects to Fidelity now more or less on regular basis. Software still flashes/flickers routinely. Also slow to load, apparently trying to read every single record into RAM, regardless of age. Pop-up screen this morning stating ""We've noticed you are not downloading your current Quicken Visa/MasterCard transactions, click here to ..."" I don't have one. Obviously a deceptive come-on intended to trick users into the application process for a Quicken credit card. Nice. Still constantly beg-screens me to take the latest software update.

[Update: October 18, 2008] Just downloaded this week's financial transactions and Quicken wiped out four months of reconciliation on one of my credit cards ... again.

[Update: January 10, 2009] Tried to change the amount of an annual repeating payment. Refused to accept the change with the error message ""You must make this change and sign on no later than six days before scheduled payment."" Payment was set for April 4, 2009, almost three months in the future. I had to delete the payment, log on to make the deletion take effect, then enter the payment all over again for the new amount, then log on again to make that payment take effect. And when I tried to log on I rec'd an error message stating an Internet connection was not detected (a message I get rather often despite my always-on broadband). Luckily I can choose the ""Ignore"" button and it will go ahead and connect. Quicken programming staff = worthless carpetbaggers.

[Update: March 5, 2009] Wanted to stop an ongoing monthly repeating payment where the next scheduled payment was already in place in my register for March 27. I edited in a change for ""how many times"" from ""unlimited"" to ""1."" In other words, I wanted to pay on March 27 for the last time. When I logged on to the bank the first time, Quicken canceled the March 27 payment. Now doesn't that take the cake--Quicken accounting/finance software programmers are unable to count up to one. And, as all too often anymore, the screen went wacko while I was logging onto the bank.

[Update: March 8, 2009] Quicken just UNreconciled one of my credit cards (again) back to the October, 2008 close. Luckily, its a card I don't use much. I suppose this has something to do with Quicken software coders not understanding the start of Daylight Savings Time.

[Update: March 27, 2009] The repeating payment change I referred to at March 5, 2009? The saga continues. When I tried to enter the NEW repeating payment, it wouldn't take. I entered it, connected to the bank and nothing happened. The payment did not show in the list of repeating payments or in the register. I tried deleting the payee entirely to start over, but Quicken wouldn't/won't let me delete that payee at all. It claims it cannot be deleted because there is a repeating payment in effect ... that would be the payment that is ALREADY canceled. Which means I can't cancel it so I can't delete the payee. To set up the new payment I ended up having to create an entire new payee to make the new payment 'take.' I had to put a dash in the middle of the account number to create the new payee since Quicken won't allow two repeating payments with the exact same account number. And I am still stuck with the old payee on file which I cannot delete at all. I had to call the bank twice just to make sure the durn payment is actually going to be made on time ... and made only once ... and for the correct amount. You would think there would be a way to force deletion of a payee. Then again YOU are thinking, Quicken programmers on the other hand are off somewhere slurping down a latte.

[Update: April 2, 2009] Have an established monthly recurring payment of $[...] and would like to change it to $[...]. Enter the Online Center, click on Repeating. There it is. Click on it then select Edit. Change the amount from $[...] to $[...]. Save the change. Seems simple enough. Log on to the bank. Result: (1) Quicken cancels the next pending payment, on April 19, of $[...]. So far so good. (2) Quicken enters a pending payment into the checkbook register for $[...] dated May 19. Huh? What happened to my April payment? God only knows what will happen if I tinker with this recurring payment any further. I will write a paper check for one month ... and hope for the best. A[...]

[Update: July 14, 2009] Quicken is popping up a screen telling me I am overdue on a July 10 payment to a vendor for $[...]. The register shows the payment was made and cleared on July 10. And it's reminding me to schedule another future payment ... that's already scheduled. It's the same durn thing I was talking about in bullet # 2 at the top of the review, apparently it's a zombie bug that has now risen from the dead. Still begs me to take the Quicken software update constantly.

[Update: September 15, 2009] Quicken has suddenly started reminding me ... once again ... that certain bills are overdue, even though they've already been paid using the automatic monthly payment function. It asks me if I want to delete, pay or skip. I can only guess what havoc might occur if I delete or skip ... so I just keep waiting for the nag screen to eventually go away.

[Update: January 17, 2010] Repeating payment to my HOA increasing by four bucks a month. Learned already the hard way that if you change it by just increasing the payment, it doesn't take. So I first deleted the existing repeating payment entirely (but not the existing payee). Logged onto the bank. Deletion occurred properly. THEN I tried to create a new repeating payment (using the existing payee). Enter all the information - and nothing happens. Just like I never entered it at all. Rebooting, log on to the bank again, no change. So I created a new payee (with slightly different spellings for payee name and account number since those fields define the unique payee). Creation took place properly - after every desktop icon on screen flashed on and off screen for nearly a minute. Logged on to bank to let Quicken advise of new payee. THEN created new payment using the tweaked, new payee. Logged on again. More icon flashing in process. New repeating payment now appears in register. Although it has NOT always done so in the past, THIS TIME Quicken let me delete the old payee. For users that can't figure out these kinds of workarounds, the simple, everyday-routine, core process of adjusting the amount of a repeating payment simply doesn't work. It USED to work in older versions of Quicken, so I can only assume Quicken programmers spend their lazy afternoons destroying old code and functionality - instead of writing new code to fix known bugs.

[Update: January 26, 2010] The above described payment (at four bucks more) was made successfully to the HOA yesterday. In the Quicken Bill Reminder Tray it says I have FOUR payments missing - all to the HOA, all at the new 'four bucks more' amount, two of them due yesterday and two of them due today. As always when this tray incorrectly reports overdue payments, the tray's three choices are Enter, Edit and Skip. Which one would you dare use to try to get the stuff to disappear? If you choose Skip, will it take the payment back? Maybe in the mirror-image BizarroWorld that is Quicken software.

[Update: July 25, 2010] Used a certain credit card last month (that hadn't been used otherwise in about eight months). The account had been live and retrieving transactions without incident for years. The account password is saved in Quicken so that it can do so. But guess what, those new transactions did not retrieve after multiple log-ons (using Quicken's ""one-step update"" which logs on to all active accounts in a single pass). Quicken reflects the account as active for transaction retrieval, everything AOK. Quicken also reflects the connection took place with the account without error. If I didn't KNOW I had transactions not retrieved, I wouldn't have had the least idea there was an error. Not that Quicken would give me the least indication to do so, I went ahead and tried solving the error by re-running the account through the 'online initialization' process again. It worked. The transactions then retrieved normally. HOWEVER the NEXT time I tried to run through the logon/retrieval process, Quicken demanded I provide the account's password. That would be the very same password it had in storage to begin with - and that I JUST provided to Quicken a SECOND time when I did the re-initialization. Dumb, dumb, dumb. Also, after the re-initialization, I started getting a message that claims 'your last update attempt was not successful, do you want to re-try?"" I figure that erroneous message will resolve itself after enough time has eroded since 'my last update attempt.'

[Update: August 8, 2010] I wanted to change the amount for a repeating payment (the equal pay plan for my utility bill was adjusted), so I used the `change' function. Kick me in the *** because (1) using the obviously correct approach in Quicken often means trouble and (2) I've tried this before and it's a major fail. I opened the repeating payment, changed the amount and clicked the OK button. As I was signing on, Quicken advised it would be changing the payment amount just exactly as I had entered it. Result: both payments, old and new, are in the register. I marked the old payment for deletion and re-connected to the bank. The bank generated an error message stating that the old payment had already been cancelled. I tried deleting the old payment from my register and it won't budge. It demands that I must log on in order to complete the deletion. As I just said, when I logged on the bank refused to recognize the deletion request.

OK. I have a new plan for opening a can of whoop@ss on Quicken's demons. I will delete the NEW payment, then delete the payee entirely. Then Quicken will HAVE to let go of the old payment, right? Then I will re-create the payee. I marked the new payment for deletion and logged on. It WAS deleted at both the bank AND in the Quicken register. But when I try to delete the payee, Quicken says ""cannot delete payee for which there are repeating online payments scheduled."" Go to the screen that lists all the repeating payments. Nothing there. Go back to the register. The old payment is still there. The old payment that refuses to be deleted until it yaks with the bank ... too bad the bank says it's already deleted and won't yak. Totally screwed by Quicken again.

Eventually I discover via Googling that Quicken has an undocumented save posted in their support blogs - to use CTRL to force the deletion of the old payment. It works. I suppose that's worth half-a-point. OK, now let's put the new payment back (like it was before I deleted it). I enter all the information, click OK. Nothing happens. Acts like I entered nothing at all. Try it three times, zippo. I look in the list of repeating payments. I look in the transactions pending for transmission. I look in the register. Nothing. Unfortunately I've been here before. This entire process has ""imploded"" the payee, making it unusable.  I'll have to create an entirely new payee. I go to delete the old payee. It won't let me. It STILL insists I have repeating payments outstanding against it. Whattaeffing piece of software cr@pola.

I already have two other old payees I can't delete that act just like this ... even though they haven't been involved any kind of payment in at least a year. Quicken says in that same support blog webpage that using the CTRL key also forces payee deletions. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Can't get rid of it. (You can see these kinds of problems also discussed earlier in this review.) I will have to put a space or something in the account number to create a brand new payee, since that account number has already been ""used"" and Quicken won't let me re-use it. And I am stuck with another old payee I can't delete.

Oh, and down in my tab titled ""Scheduled Bills & Deposits Due"" I still  (as described above) have listed FOUR TIMES my monthly HOA payment, as being overdue from 13 days ago. (It's a repeating monthly payment set up in Quicken months ago, and it was already paid on schedule.) The four listings are actually two pairs of amounts, each pair one day apart. All of these are artifacts from where I tried to adjust that repeating payment amount when I experienced an increase. The three choices are ""enter"" ""edit"" or ""skip"" I've learned to wait until well after the bill is actually paid, then enter ""skip."" Otherwise it may well try to pay twice. (I've already described this particular bug up above ... just a reminder, it never goes away.) Bottom line:  since about 2005, the Quicken product has become totally effed up.

I am now about six months now from the next cycle of Quicken's ""sunset policy."" Every three years, you have to pay for the Quicken upgrade or they cut off your ability to download transactions from your financial institutions (Quicken servers are the `middle man"" between your software and the institutions). Maybe it's time to migrate to competing software product that works right, only has to be bought once ... and connects directly to my institution to collect unadulterated data!

[UPDATE: August 14, 2010] FREE AT LAST, FREE AT LAST !! After that last fiasco, I decided why invest more time trying to solve the Quicken problem ... when I could invest that time migrating to Moneydance 2010.

Moneydance, what a dream come true! And much less painful a migration that I imagined. Just buy the license at the website first, then download&install the product. Here's a couple of key points I learned (the hard way) that should make your migration run smooth as silk:

* Export the data from Quicken using the ""all accounts' option (not one account at a time). I had to look for it but that choice WAS in the Quicken drop-down list.

* When importing IGNORE any advice Moneydance offers that you ought check the ""Import account info only"" option (ie, to import the structure/tables/fieldnames first, then to go back and re-do the procedure to get the data records). When I followed that advice, I had all sorts of screwy issues, records landing every which way. When I DID NOT check the box (in essence asking Moneydance to import everything in one fell swoop - both records & structure/tables/fieldnames for all of the Quicken accounts) everything dropped right into place, ready to roll. The only record that did not import correctly (and I had ten years of records over about fifteen accounts) was the ""original transfer balance in"" for one account.

After that I did have to do some minor clean-up for a while - entering stock symbols, entering the names I wanted to use for the accounts, other account details such as my credit card numbers. To make the stock prices update in real time (for some reason) you have to manually add-in two developer extensions. Easy to do (so long as you realize that you have to do it) and the user's guide explains how exactly. Quick and no glitches.

Moneydance swims slick as an eel. Downloading of records only takes three or four seconds at most. With Quicken it took a lot longer. Moneydance is connecting direct to the institution; Quicken is running you through its own server as an intermediary. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to find that a lot of my earlier issues (such as missing or duplicate records) that I did NOT post in my reviews (since I did not attribute them to Quicken) turn out to disappear. Because they were being CAUSED by Quicken's intermediary server. We'll see.

The online banking download setup was easy, but there were the most minor of issues. Moneydance did not have any idea of course when the last download was done (with Quicken), so it retrieved all the available records at the institutions. (Be smart and bring your Quicken accounts and downloads totally current and as reconciled as possible BEFORE you export them.) Also, where I had multiple accounts at one institution, it got confused first go-round, mixing them all up - and changing the account numbers in the setup parameters. I just deleted all the downloaded records and went back and re-entered the correct account numbers. After adjusting that first 'initializing' download for each account, no problems.

I haven't started using the 'setup payments through Moneydance' feature yet. My bet it'll be easy.

Moneydance. Just do it.",1
"When Quicken goes under, I'm going to wear a pink tuxedo to the funeral.

[These comments are based on my continuing nightmare of lousy experiences with Quicken Deluxe 2008. This software, which has been getting continually worse since 2002, couldn't have possibly improved since then ... ]

For me Quicken 2008 was a forced/hostage upgrade from Quicken 2005. You ""have"" to upgrade since they've cut a deal with the financial institutions to cut off your online access with the institutions if you don't upgrade every three years. Just as found when I was hostage upgraded in 2005 from 2002, there's nothing more than a cosmetic face-lift, no meaningful fixes/improvements -- but there's even more bugs, problems and aggravation.

* Product now will not connect properly to Fidelity; no problem under 2005.

* Took forever to figure out how to turn off a ""reminder"" function ... that kept reminding me to pay bills already scheduled to be
paid using the auto-pay function. 2005 did the same thing and it's not been fixed.

*You can turn off the product registration nag screen ... if you Google to find out how. Product does not have to be registered to use it.

* Un-reconciles accounts six months back every once in a while. I've been assuming that's being caused by a few bytes of bad data that occasionally comes from the financial institutions ... that the Quicken people have not properly coded so as to filter out. This bug also surfaced in 2005. Two weeks into 2008, I've seen it again already.

* You can't turn off the ""free update/revision"" nag screen unless you take the update. No such nag screen in 2005.

* When connecting, the completion screen used to show which accounts had new transactions to match and had convenient buttons next to each to take you directly to the account. Gone in 2008. Now I have to look through every account each time to see where transactions might have been retrieved.

* Icons everywhere attempting to peddle other unwanted Quicken products. One of the 'product improvements' in 2008.

* Doesn't handle stock distributions correctly (since they were not actually paid for); keeps generating error messages when you enter the correct posting of no cost incurred. Same problem in 2005.

* Tricky screens/checkboxes/prompts that try to bait you into using/enrolling for QuickenDot services when you don't have to or need to. Users that did so now post complaints they can't undo it and that the QuickenDot server is constantly down, causing problems/delays when trying to connect to other accounts using a one-step update.

Yet another company that's grown totally complacent about product quality while wallowing in its assured-for-the-moment revenue stream. It will bite them hard in the long-run. Postings indicate similar complaining regarding the major competitor product, Microsoft Money. If history is any lesson, there's no reason to suspect that these software products will ever get better under these conditions. Some other product will have to steal their customer base before they wake up and smell the coffee.

If you are not already committed to either of those two products, take a good long look at open source software such as GNU Cash.

[Update: April 15, 2008] Does now connect to Fidelity ... occasionally. When I opened the portfolio area today, the entire computer screen flashed with confusion and the product crashed. 2005 never once crashed. Still flashing but no subsequent crashes. Who knows what happened. Not me. Apparently not Quicken programmers either.

[Update: July 12, 2008] Connects to Fidelity now more or less on regular basis. Software still flashes/flickers routinely. Also slow to load, apparently trying to read every single record into RAM, regardless of age. Pop-up screen this morning stating ""We've noticed you are not downloading your current Quicken Visa/MasterCard transactions, click here to ..."" I don't have one. Obviously a deceptive come-on intended to trick users into the application process for a Quicken credit card. Nice. Still constantly beg-screens me to take the latest software update.

[Update: October 18, 2008] Just downloaded this week's financial transactions and Quicken wiped out four months of reconciliation on one of my credit cards ... again.

[Update: January 10, 2009] Tried to change the amount of an annual repeating payment. Refused to accept the change with the error message ""You must make this change and sign on no later than six days before scheduled payment."" Payment was set for April 4, 2009, almost three months in the future. I had to delete the payment, log on to make the deletion take effect, then enter the payment all over again for the new amount, then log on again to make that payment take effect. And when I tried to log on I rec'd an error message stating an Internet connection was not detected (a message I get rather often despite my always-on broadband). Luckily I can choose the ""Ignore"" button and it will go ahead and connect. Quicken programming staff = worthless carpetbaggers.

[Update: March 5, 2009] Wanted to stop an ongoing monthly repeating payment where the next scheduled payment was already in place in my register for March 27. I edited in a change for ""how many times"" from ""unlimited"" to ""1."" In other words, I wanted to pay on March 27 for the last time. When I logged on to the bank the first time, Quicken canceled the March 27 payment. Now doesn't that take the cake--Quicken accounting/finance software programmers are unable to count up to one. And, as all too often anymore, the screen went wacko while I was logging onto the bank.

[Update: March 8, 2009] Quicken just UNreconciled one of my credit cards (again) back to the October, 2008 close. Luckily, its a card I don't use much. I suppose this has something to do with Quicken software coders not understanding the start of Daylight Savings Time.

[Update: March 27, 2009] The repeating payment change I referred to at March 5, 2009? The saga continues. When I tried to enter the NEW repeating payment, it wouldn't take. I entered it, connected to the bank and nothing happened. The payment did not show in the list of repeating payments or in the register. I tried deleting the payee entirely to start over, but Quicken wouldn't/won't let me delete that payee at all. It claims it cannot be deleted because there is a repeating payment in effect ... that would be the payment that is ALREADY canceled. Which means I can't cancel it so I can't delete the payee. To set up the new payment I ended up having to create an entire new payee to make the new payment 'take.' I had to put a dash in the middle of the account number to create the new payee since Quicken won't allow two repeating payments with the exact same account number. And I am still stuck with the old payee on file which I cannot delete at all. I had to call the bank twice just to make sure the durn payment is actually going to be made on time ... and made only once ... and for the correct amount. You would think there would be a way to force deletion of a payee. Then again YOU are thinking, Quicken programmers on the other hand are off somewhere slurping down a latte.

* Un-reconciles accounts six months back every once in a while. I've been assuming that's being caused by a few bytes of bad data that occasionally comes from the financial institutions ... that the Quicken people have not properly coded so as to filter out. This bug also surfaced in 2005. Two weeks into 2008, I've seen it again already.

* You can't turn off the ""free update/revision"" nag screen unless you take the update. No such nag screen in 2005.

* When connecting, the completion screen used to show which accounts had new transactions to match and had convenient buttons next to each to take you directly to the account. Gone in 2008. Now I have to look through every account each time to see where transactions might have been retrieved.

* Icons everywhere attempting to peddle other unwanted Quicken products. One of the 'product improvements' in 2008.

* Doesn't handle stock distributions correctly (since they were not actually paid for); keeps generating error messages when you enter the correct posting of no cost incurred. Same problem in 2005.

* Tricky screens/checkboxes/prompts that try to bait you into using/enrolling for QuickenDot services when you don't have to or need to. Users that did so now post complaints they can't undo it and that the QuickenDot server is constantly down, causing problems/delays when trying to connect to other accounts using a one-step update.

Yet another company that's grown totally complacent about product quality while wallowing in its assured-for-the-moment revenue stream. It will bite them hard in the long-run. Postings indicate similar complaining regarding the major competitor product, Microsoft Money. If history is any lesson, there's no reason to suspect that these software products will ever get better under these conditions. Some other product will have to steal their customer base before they wake up and smell the coffee.

If you are not already committed to either of those two products, take a good long look at open source software such as GNU Cash.

[Update: April 15, 2008] Does now connect to Fidelity ... occasionally. When I opened the portfolio area today, the entire computer screen flashed with confusion and the product crashed. 2005 never once crashed. Still flashing but no subsequent crashes. Who knows what happened. Not me. Apparently not Quicken programmers either.

[Update: July 12, 2008] Connects to Fidelity now more or less on regular basis. Software still flashes/flickers routinely. Also slow to load, apparently trying to read every single record into RAM, regardless of age. Pop-up screen this morning stating ""We've noticed you are not downloading your current Quicken Visa/MasterCard transactions, click here to ..."" I don't have one. Obviously a deceptive come-on intended to trick users into the application process for a Quicken credit card. Nice. Still constantly beg-screens me to take the latest software update.

[Update: October 18, 2008] Just downloaded this week's financial transactions and Quicken wiped out four months of reconciliation on one of my credit cards ... again.

[Update: January 10, 2009] Tried to change the amount of an annual repeating payment. Refused to accept the change with the error message ""You must make this change and sign on no later than six days before scheduled payment."" Payment was set for April 4, 2009, almost three months in the future. I had to delete the payment, log on to make the deletion take effect, then enter the payment all over again for the new amount, then log on again to make that payment take effect. And when I tried to log on I rec'd an error message stating an Internet connection was not detected (a message I get rather often despite my always-on broadband). Luckily I can choose the ""Ignore"" button and it will go ahead and connect. Quicken programming staff = worthless carpetbaggers.

[Update: March 5, 2009] Wanted to stop an ongoing monthly repeating payment where the next scheduled payment was already in place in my register for March 27. I edited in a change for ""how many times"" from ""unlimited"" to ""1."" In other words, I wanted to pay on March 27 for the last time. When I logged on to the bank the first time, Quicken canceled the March 27 payment. Now doesn't that take the cake--Quicken accounting/finance software programmers are unable to count up to one. And, as all too often anymore, the screen went wacko while I was logging onto the bank.

[Update: March 8, 2009] Quicken just UNreconciled one of my credit cards (again) back to the October, 2008 close. Luckily, its a card I don't use much. I suppose this has something to do with Quicken software coders not understanding the start of Daylight Savings Time.

[Update: March 27, 2009] The repeating payment change I referred to at March 5, 2009? The saga continues. When I tried to enter the NEW repeating payment, it wouldn't take. I entered it, connected to the bank and nothing happened. The payment did not show in the list of repeating payments or in the register. I tried deleting the payee entirely to start over, but Quicken wouldn't/won't let me delete that payee at all. It claims it cannot be deleted because there is a repeating payment in effect ... that would be the payment that is ALREADY canceled. Which means I can't cancel it so I can't delete the payee. To set up the new payment I ended up having to create an entire new payee to make the new payment 'take.' I had to put a dash in the middle of the account number to create the new payee since Quicken won't allow two repeating payments with the exact same account number. And I am still stuck with the old payee on file which I cannot delete at all. I had to call the bank twice just to make sure the durn payment is actually going to be made on time ... and made only once ... and for the correct amount. You would think there would be a way to force deletion of a payee. Then again YOU are thinking, Quicken programmers on the other hand are off somewhere slurping down a latte.

[Update: April 2, 2009] Have an established monthly recurring payment of $X and would like to change it to $Y. Enter the Online Center, click on Repeating. There it is. Click on it then select Edit. Change the amount from $X to $Y. Save the change. Seems simple enough. Log on to the bank. Result: (1) Quicken cancels the next pending payment, on April 19, of $X. So far so good. (2) Quicken enters a pending payment into the checkbook register for $Y dated May 19. Huh? What happened to my April payment? God only knows what will happen if I tinker with this recurring payment any further. I will write a paper check for one month ... and hope for the best.

[Update: July 14, 2009] Quicken is popping up a screen telling me I am overdue on a July 10 payment to a vendor. The register shows the payment was made and cleared on July 10. And it's reminding me to schedule another future payment ... that's already scheduled. It's the same durn thing I was talking about in bullet # 2 at the top of the review, apparently it's a zombie bug that has now risen from the dead. Still begs me to take the Quicken software update constantly.

[Update: September 15, 2009] Quicken has suddenly started reminding me ... once again ... that certain bills are overdue, even though they've already been paid using the automatic monthly payment function. It asks me if I want to delete, pay or skip. I can only guess what havoc might occur if I delete or skip ... so I just keep waiting for the nag screen to eventually go away.

[Update: January 17, 2010] Repeating payment to my HOA increasing by four bucks a month. Learned already the hard way that if you change it by just increasing the payment, it doesn't take. So I first deleted the existing repeating payment entirely (but not the existing payee). Logged onto the bank. Deletion occurred properly. THEN I tried to create a new repeating payment (using the existing payee). Enter all the information - and nothing happens. Just like I never entered it at all. Rebooting, log on to the bank again, no change. So I created a new payee (with slightly different spellings for payee name and account number since those fields define the unique payee). Creation took place properly - after every desktop icon on screen flashed on and off screen for nearly a minute. Logged on to bank to let Quicken advise of new payee. THEN created new payment using the tweaked, new payee. Logged on again. More icon flashing in process. New repeating payment now appears in register. Although it has NOT always done so in the past, THIS TIME Quicken let me delete the old payee. For users that can't figure out these kinds of workarounds, the simple, everyday-routine, core process of adjusting the amount of a repeating payment simply doesn't work. It USED to work in older versions of Quicken, so I can only assume Quicken programmers spend their lazy afternoons destroying old code and functionality - instead of writing new code to fix known bugs.

[Update: January 26, 2010] The above described payment (at four bucks more) was made successfully to the HOA yesterday. In the Quicken Bill Reminder Tray it says I have FOUR payments missing - all to the HOA, all at the new 'four bucks more' amount, two of them due yesterday and two of them due today. As always when this tray incorrectly reports overdue payments, the tray's three choices are Enter, Edit and Skip. Which one would you dare use to try to get the stuff to disappear? If you choose Skip, will it take the payment back? Maybe in the mirror-image BizarroWorld that is Quicken software.

[Update: July 25, 2010] Used a certain credit card last month (that hadn't been used otherwise in about eight months). The account had been live and retrieving transactions without incident for years. The account password is saved in Quicken so that it can do so. But guess what, those new transactions did not retrieve after multiple log-ons (using Quicken's ""one-step update"" which logs on to all active accounts in a single pass). Quicken reflects the account as active for transaction retrieval, everything AOK. Quicken also reflects the connection took place with the account without error. If I didn't KNOW I had transactions not retrieved, I wouldn't have had the least idea there was an error. Not that Quicken would give me the least indication to do so, I went ahead and tried solving the error by re-running the account through the 'online initialization' process again. It worked. The transactions then retrieved normally. HOWEVER the NEXT time I tried to run through the logon/retrieval process, Quicken demanded I provide the account's password. That would be the very same password it had in storage to begin with - and that I JUST provided to Quicken a SECOND time when I did the re-initialization. Dumb, dumb, dumb. Also, after the re-initialization, I started getting a message that claims 'your last update attempt was not successful, do you want to re-try?"" I figure that erroneous message will resolve itself after enough time has eroded since 'my last update attempt.'

[Update: August 8, 2010] I wanted to change the amount for a repeating payment (the equal pay plan for my utility bill was adjusted), so I used the `change' function. Kick me in the *** because (1) using the obviously correct approach in Quicken often means trouble and (2) I've tried this before and it's a major fail. I opened the repeating payment, changed the amount and clicked the OK button. As I was signing on, Quicken advised it would be changing the payment amount just exactly as I had entered it. Result: both payments, old and new, are in the register. I marked the old payment for deletion and re-connected to the bank. The bank generated an error message stating that the old payment had already been cancelled. I tried deleting the old payment from my register and it won't budge. It demands that I must log on in order to complete the deletion. As I just said, when I logged on the bank refused to recognize the deletion request.

OK. I have a new plan for opening a can of whoop@ss on Quicken's demons. I will delete the NEW payment, then delete the payee entirely. Then Quicken will HAVE to let go of the old payment, right? Then I will re-create the payee. I marked the new payment for deletion and logged on. It WAS deleted at both the bank AND in the Quicken register. But when I try to delete the payee, Quicken says ""cannot delete payee for which there are repeating online payments scheduled."" Go to the screen that lists all the repeating payments. Nothing there. Go back to the register. The old payment is still there. The old payment that refuses to be deleted until it yaks with the bank ... too bad the bank says it's already deleted and won't yak. Totally screwed by Quicken again.

Eventually I discover via Googling that Quicken has an undocumented save posted in their support blogs - to use CTRL to force the deletion of the old payment. It works. I suppose that's worth half-a-point. OK, now let's put the new payment back (like it was before I deleted it). I enter all the information, click OK. Nothing happens. Acts like I entered nothing at all. Try it three times, zippo. I look in the list of repeating payments. I look in the transactions pending for transmission. I look in the register. Nothing. Unfortunately I've been here before. This entire process has ""imploded"" the payee, making it unusable.  I'll have to create an entirely new payee. I go to delete the old payee. It won't let me. It STILL insists I have repeating payments outstanding against it. Whattaeffing piece of software cr@pola.

I already have two other old payees I can't delete that act just like this ... even though they haven't been involved any kind of payment in at least a year. Quicken says in that same support blog webpage that using the CTRL key also forces payee deletions. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Can't get rid of it. (You can see these kinds of problems also discussed earlier in this review.) I will have to put a space or something in the account number to create a brand new payee, since that account number has already been ""used"" and Quicken won't let me re-use it. And I am stuck with another old payee I can't delete.

Oh, and down in my tab titled ""Scheduled Bills & Deposits Due"" I still  (as described above) have listed FOUR TIMES my monthly HOA payment, as being overdue from 13 days ago. (It's a repeating monthly payment set up in Quicken months ago, and it was already paid on schedule.) The four listings are actually two pairs of amounts, each pair one day apart. All of these are artifacts from where I tried to adjust that repeating payment amount when I experienced an increase. The three choices are ""enter"" ""edit"" or ""skip"" I've learned to wait until well after the bill is actually paid, then enter ""skip."" Otherwise it may well try to pay twice. (I've already described this particular bug up above ... just a reminder, it never goes away.) Bottom line:  since about 2005, the Quicken product has become totally effed up.

I am now about six months now from the next cycle of Quicken's ""sunset policy."" Every three years, you have to pay for the Quicken upgrade or they cut off your ability to download transactions from your financial institutions (Quicken servers are the `middle man"" between your software and the institutions). Maybe it's time to migrate to competing software product that works right, only has to be bought once ... and connects directly to my institution to collect unadulterated data!

When Quicken goes under, I'm going to wear a pink tuxedo to the funeral.

[UPDATE: August 14, 2010] FREE AT LAST, FREE AT LAST !! After that last fiasco, I decided why invest more time trying to solve the Quicken problem ... when I could invest that time migrating to Moneydance 2010.

Moneydance, what a dream come true! And much less painful a migration that I imagined. Just buy the license at the website first, then download&install the product. Here's a couple of key points I learned (the hard way) that should make your migration run smooth as silk:

* Export the data from Quicken using the ""all accounts' option (not one account at a time). I had to look for it but that choice WAS in the Quicken drop-down list.

* When importing IGNORE any advice Moneydance offers that you ought check the ""Import account info only"" option (ie, to import the structure/tables/fieldnames first, then to go back and re-do the procedure to get the data records). When I followed that advice, I had all sorts of screwy issues, records landing every which way. When I DID NOT check the box (in essence asking Moneydance to import everything in one fell swoop - both records & structure/tables/fieldnames for all of the Quicken accounts) everything dropped right into place, ready to roll. The only record that did not import correctly (and I had ten years of records over about fifteen accounts) was the ""original transfer balance in"" for one account.

After that I did have to do some minor clean-up for a while - entering stock symbols, entering the names I wanted to use for the accounts, other account details such as my credit card numbers. To make the stock prices update in real time (for some reason) you have to manually add-in two developer extensions. Easy to do (so long as you realize that you have to do it) and the user's guide explains how exactly. Quick and no glitches.

Moneydance swims slick as an eel. Downloading of records only takes three or four seconds at most. With Quicken it took a lot longer. Moneydance is connecting direct to the institution; Quicken is running you through its own server as an intermediary. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to find that a lot of my earlier issues (such as missing or duplicate records) that I did NOT post in my reviews (since I did not attribute them to Quicken) turn out to disappear. Because they were being CAUSED by Quicken's intermediary server. We'll see.

The online banking download setup was easy, but there were the most minor of issues. Moneydance did not have any idea of course when the last download was done (with Quicken), so it retrieved all the available records at the institutions. (Be smart and bring your Quicken accounts and downloads totally current and as reconciled as possible BEFORE you export them.) Also, where I had multiple accounts at one institution, it got confused first go-round, mixing them all up - and changing the account numbers in the setup parameters. I just deleted all the downloaded records and went back and re-entered the correct account numbers. After adjusting that first `initializing' download for each account, no problems.

I haven't started using the `setup payments through Moneydance' feature yet. My bet it'll be easy.

Moneydance. Just do it.",1
"Final Update - On February 1, 2011, I went to the Autodesk website to check for additional updates and found that FreeStyle had been withdrawn from sale.  Customer support stopped April 1, 2011.

Update 10/7/2010 - The first product update was released a couple of weeks ago. The major change fixes the first item below...you can now create custom symbols and store them in the library.  I'm still in the process of evaluating the release and will update this note after I've used it a bit more.

Original Review:
The designers of a package like AutoCAD FreeStyle face a classic challenge: It needs to be easy to use for a novice, with enough features to be useful, yet not so powerful that it will cannibalize sales of the high-end (and much more expensive) AutoCAD systems.  After spending a couple of days using AutoCAD FreeStyle, I think the designers set the bar way too low.  The interface is simple and easy to learn, but far too many features are missing for FreeStyle to be a competitive program.  That's not to say that FreeStyle can't be used to produce usable drawings; it just could be much better if it included basic features that are in other systems.  Let me go through some of the areas that stood out...

Symbol Library - A library is a collection of symbols that are created once and then used on multiple drawings.  FreeStyle comes with a collection of prebuilt symbols that are sufficient to get started, however it's not a complete enough library for a lot of projects - when I attempted to draw my sprinkler system, I discovered that there are no sprinkler components listed.  In most CAD systems, this problem is addressed by allowing the user to build custom symbols.  Once they're added to the library, they can be repeatedly used in future drawings.  This release of FreeStyle doesn't have that capability.  The symbols that come with the program are all that you've got, and that simply isn't enough.  Incidentally, what's in the library is even a little strange... the Electrical Symbols tab includes five Gas and Water symbols along with the basic electrical symbols and the Building Components section only contains six fireplace facades...I'm sure that in real life there are more building components than just those.

Paper Size and Scale - When you start a new drawing, the program asks you to select the size of the paper and the object that you' re going to draw.  e.g. you pick 8.5 x 11"" paper and select that the page represents a 30' x 40' space.  The scale shows that "" equals 1'.  This makes perfect sense to anybody not used to using a CAD program, but is backwards from the norm...normally a designer would select a paper size and a scale.

Splines - Splines are a way of smoothly connecting a series of points.  By adjusting the ""handles"", you can easily draw complex curves.  FreeStyle doesn't have a way of drawing with splines.  The menu allows you to draw with arc segments, straight lines and freehand ""doodles"".  You can adjust the points of inflection on the doodle and eventually get to the desired curve, but it's not as easy as it seems.  True spline capability would be easier.

Radius line joins - When drawing a floor plan, most lines meet with a sharp corner, but that's not always the case.  Sometimes a drawing needs to have a rounded curve joining the two lines.  Most 2-D drafting systems can do that automatically, but FreeStyle lacks that capability.  You can manually accomplish the same thing by drawing a small arc, but why?  You're only talking about a millisecond of computer time to have the program do it for you.

Double lines for walls - Often walls in architectural drawings are shown by two parallel lines, representing the inside and outside surfaces.  Freestyle doesn't have that ability built-in.  To do it correctly, it's a little more complicated that just having a double line as a selectable line type....you need to specify wall thickness, join corners correctly and scale appropriately as the drawing size changes.  Again, all this can be done manually, but the basic idea is to have the program save time by doing the work for you.  Incidentally, the work around is to simply draw a thick solid line for walls...look at all the sample drawings for examples.

Draw a wall of a house.  Now drag a window or door from the symbol library and place it onto the wall.  You'd think that the wall would break and allow the object to be inserted.  It doesn't.  OK, now manually break the wall into two separate line segments and drag the line ends apart to create the necessary break.  That would work, if there was a way to break a line into two pieces, but there isn't.  So you nuke the whole side of the house and redraw two separate line segments on either side of the door.  That works...until you realize that the door is 6"" to the left of where it should be.

The algorithm that calculates color fills is flaky.  When you drag the fill icon over a fillable area, the area is highlighted with a light version of the fill color. It's a nice idea, so you can see exactly where the color's going.  Unfortunately, a single open pixel prevents an area from filling.  The highlighting, though, isn't nearly so discerning.  It's not unusual to have an area highlight, but fail to fill when clicking on the mouse button.  I also managed to fill in an object and then select the color and move it while leaving the outline behind...it was a little strange.

There's no instruction manual.  You can get help for any of the commands by selecting that command and clicking the question mark icon.  Clicking on the icon showing three stacked baby letter blocks takes you to the Freestyle website where there is more detailed information.  It's annoying, though, not to have something you can skim through.  I was trying to figure out how to color in a tree and it wasn't until I saw a picture in the on-line help that I realized that the color was coming from a filled in circle located behind the tree.

I could add more, but you get the idea.  If the product manager at AutoDesk chooses, all of these can (and should) be fixed in a future release.  Until then, though, I'm only giving FreeStyle two stars.  The simple user interface is right on the mark for a non-technical consumer level product.  The omitted features, though, cost it dearly in the ability to produce usable and functional drawings.",1
"""Quicken Essentials For Mac"" is a toy plastic knife for the tasks of skinning the personal finance grizzly bear. Its lack of essential features is a longstanding, running joke in the Mac personal finance user community. Intuit's epic failure to update Quicken for Mac -- now extending over more than seven years since release of Quicken for Mac 2007 in August 2006 -- the subsequent release of ""Quicken Essentials"", which actually was a downgrade, and Intuit's general neglect of the Mac OS, amount to the worst betrayal of customer loyalty and dashed customer hopes in the entire history of Mac software.

If you are looking for personal finance software for Mac, Intuit is the wrong place to look. Intuit has not updated Quicken for Mac since release of the 2007 version in August 2006. Quicken for Mac 2007 was just patched two or three times when its bugs and incompatibilities stopped it working in updates of Mac OS X. This ""Quicken Essentials For Mac"", although a later product than Quicken for Mac, has not been updated since 2010. It is a downgrade, and a contradiction in terms, because it has even fewer essential features than its out-of-date predecessor. It has no counterpart in the far more capable Quicken For Windows range.

The most capable and best-supported personal finance software for Mac, by far, is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/iBank-5-Download/dp/B00GUXLRCQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">iBank 5 [Download</a>]. It has a different interface and works differently to Quicken, but has many similar capabilities, such as multiple currencies, that Intuit provides in its Quicken Windows products, yet inexcusably has failed to provide for the Mac OS. After accumulating 14 years of detailed financial data in Quicken for Mac, futilely waiting for a QFM upgrade that never came, and observing the release of this QEFM downgrade with despair and disgust, I switched to iBank at its version 4. Now I have almost 16 years of data in iBank 5 -- more detailed, reliable and useful than any data I previously kept in Quicken. My only regret has been that I did not switch sooner. My review titled 'The best and most full-featured personal finance software for Mac OS just got better', explaining in detail my experience of iBank 5, is at http://www.amazon.com/review/RUKMMLY61JDC6/

Ignore the silly, misinformed, unsubstantiated and fake reviews attacking iBank: iBank 5 is really a 4 to 5-star application. On the face of it, on average, Amazon customer reviewers rank both iBank and QEFM as two-star products. This appearance of equivalence is misleading: it suggests that these two products, iBank and Quicken Essentials For Mac, are equivalent, and that all ""customer reviews"" are equal -- or genuine -- when it is self-evident, on close examination, that none of this appearance of equivalence is true. The best substantiated, most factual reviews of Quicken Essentials For Mac prove that it is a deficient and inferior product with relatively few capabilities; while the best substantiated and most factual reviews of iBank prove that it is a capable, reliable and superior product, with many more capabilities and features for personal finance than QEFM.

For a far more accurate picture of what customers really think about these products than can be obtained from the raw numbers of positive or negative reviews in Amazon, it is necessary to consider the much higher proportion of helpful votes on substantiated positive reviews of iBank, compared to the highest proportion of helpful votes on substantiated *negative* reviews of QEFM.

So, how bad is ""Quicken Essentials For Mac"", really? The worst of all personal finance software for all operating systems, according to Amazon customer votes. QEFM is so bad that Intuit itself recommends Mac users seeking more and better features use, instead of QEFM,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quicken-Personal-Finances-2007-for-Mac-OLD-VERSION/dp/B000GI0HR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quicken Personal Finances 2007 for Mac [OLD VERSION</a>]. QEFM is so bad that Intuit admits its inferiority to an obsolete and deficient product which it has not updated for *more than seven years*.

Here are some revealing, mind-boggling actual statements copied and pasted from Intuit's own blurb for ""Quicken Essentials"":
""Quicken Mac 2007 and earlier users should note that this is a brand new product, so some of the features you've grown used to may not be included."" (Double take. Read again. Yes, the maker explicitly admits that its ""brand new product"" -- which itself has not been updated for about four years -- lacks features of a slew of much older outdated products it supposedly replaces.)
""If you need more more advanced investment features, try Quicken Mac 2007.""
""Can I export my data to TurboTax? Quicken Essentials for Mac does not support that capability. If you'd like that functionality, we recommend trying Quicken Mac 2007.""

""Quicken Essentials For Mac"" is so bad that Amazon customers have given more helpful votes, by multiples, to negative one-star reviews of it than to any positive or negative review of all personal finance software -- including all Quicken Windows products. This is an accurate reflection of the global Mac personal finance user community assessment of this backward product, and our frustration with Intuit.

Why Intuit has not drawn the right conclusions from Mac user feedback on product development, and has not taken the obvious and necessary course of cross-platforming the many good features it has rolled out in Quicken for Windows, is one of the great mysteries of the personal computer age.

At this date, the review with the most helpful votes (1,567 of 1,608) of *all personal finance software* in Amazon.com is Brent Stanley's one-star negative review of ""Quicken Essentials For Mac"", titled 'Don't even waste your time', at http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CHAGVHW73QDO/ . My personal favorite QEFM review is the third top-rated (294 helpful votes of 300), by George Beahm, titled 'In the words of Intuit's CEO Aaron Patzer: ""Holy crap!"" ', at http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KNUPS0QOPJER/ .

My review of the tragedy and stagnation of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quicken-Personal-Finances-2007-for-Mac-OLD-VERSION/dp/B000GI0HR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quicken Personal Finances 2007 for Mac [OLD VERSION</a>] can be read at http://www.amazon.com/review/R18R6HHP6PYNQ/

Some reviews and comments here in Amazon misguidedly advocate an extraordinarily risky, expensive and distasteful alternative to the obsolete Quicken Mac products: emulating, on a Mac, the Windows operating system that most Mac users never want to touch, for the sole purpose of running a Windows version of Quicken. No-one has better refuted this proposition, exposing its flaws and risks in detail, than Bernard A. Torbik in his one-star negative review of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quicken-Deluxe-2014-Download/dp/B00E7X9RUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quicken Deluxe 2014 [Download</a>], 'Save your money' at http://www.amazon.com/review/RHP4GOMV9CLL5/ .

"UPDATE, 7/19/2012:  see the comments to this review from Acronis.  They claim the latest update to their installer was July 12, the day after my review below.  Well, they just sent me that latest installer, and it failed just as described below.  So a company which doesn't test its own installer, is not a company which pays close enough attention to the all-important issue of backups.  I won't do business with them.  Three times, same failure: with the initial CD bought here at Amazon, with the installer at Acronis on July 11 2012, and the one they just sent me today, allegedly dated from July 12, 2012.  Someone isn't paying attention to quality control.  Not good.

Important:  when you have a program like Norton GoBack, you can scroll back your drive to an earlier time.  You also get to see all the computer activity.  So this program never registered with Windows, and never installed icons on the hard drive before rebooting.  So it is not an OS or permissions problem -- I am the sole user of my machines and of course have full privileges -- but instead the programmer didn't write the program correctly.  And no one tested the installer prior to putting it on the internet for download.  Shouldn't have to require a customer like me complaining, for the correction to be made.  It should have been TESTED prior to release.  Again, not good.

UPDATE, 8/2/12 -- Acronis kept trying to blame Norton GoBack for the installation problem, again wanting to remotely connect to my computer.  This, despite the fact that I told them REPEATEDLY that I'd UNINSTALLED Acronis, a process which took 90 minutes, since only via Norton GoBack, could I uninstall it.  Now, here's the rub: GoBack records all computer activity.  So prior to rolling back the computer to uninstall Acronis, I VIEWED the activity of the installation.  Every file copied to temp files, then to the final directory, etc.  It never went through the function of REGISTERING with Windows.  It just rebooted the computer PRIOR TO registration, and of course didn't install any icons for Start Menu or desktop, nor offer the user the option to install icons.  All that activity and lack of activity, was IN the GoBack log.  So I KNOW what's wrong, and told Acronis.  Repeatedly.  They still kept writing me, until I finally refused to talk to them anymore about it.  So this kind of response, tells you much:  avoid Acronis.  Their Customer Service including two supervisors, don't even know computer basics.

So if your experience with Acronis has been good, fine.  Hope it stays that way.  My experience above and below, demonstrates a company which doesn't know its own programming.

So what is a good backup and OS/disc recovery program?  Macrium Reflect 5.  Works like a charm.  Just learned of it on cnet, and installed it, July 10, 2012.

Below, between the === 's, is the original review of Acronis.

================= original review of July 11, 2012 ==============

I made the mistake of buying this product some months back without using it, so of course now I can't get my money back.  WARNING: if you do as I did, you'll get a message on install telling you there is a later version, and recommending you select it.  DON'T DO THAT.  The later version depends on the program already being installed on your machine.  So it will seemingly install -- meaning copy files -- but will NOT register with Windows, and will NOT log itself into your Start Menu (on XP Pro, here), and will NOT create launch icons.

Adding insult to injury, this software has the longest product key I've ever typed, 71 characters.  Truly a pain to install.

So, if you're lucky to have GoBack as I am, you spend the next hour after the first half-hour's installation, uninstalling the program that way.  Since it didn't register itself in Windows, you can't uninstall it from Windows.  If you go to its Program files section and you click on its uninstall.exe, that program tells you Acronis is not on the system -- though it's IN the Acronis file under Program Files!

Okay, so if you instead install from the CD after rolling back your machine to before the 'later version' suggested as installation instead -- thus installing the earlier CD version -- what happens?  THE SAME THING.  So again you need a restoration program like Norton GoBack, to roll back your machine to pre-installation, else you can't uninstall a program which itself, doesn't know it is installed.  So you waste another 90 minutes.

Now, given the nature of this program, which claims to protect your files and computer, to copy sectors and partitions -- such a defective installation does not bode well for the competence of the program itself.  It claims to be able to do great things, yet can't even do a simple installation, or detect its own presence in a file folder?

Look: mistakes happen.  Programmer typos have big results and are hard to detect.  No problem.  But a massive oversight like this implies a systemic problem with the software.  Given owner complaints in the Acronis forum (at least they have one), it seems as though the systemic problem isn't getting the attention it needs.  These are life-or-death programs.  They need more professional service.  And, they should charge more.  Here, you waste $20 and three or four hours' time (so it ends up costing you $420, because anyone's time these days is worth $100 per hour).

My guess is that the url for registration is not included in the installer, or is defective, so it just aborted the install without telling you that's what happened.  So you think it finished installation, since it says it successfully installed, even when you ABORT the installation, lol.  So I'm sending this review link to Acronis, hoping they will respond and this can be fixed.

=============================

So don't make my mistake, and buy this program.  Closest thing to Norton GoBack (no longer sold, not good for Win7), is MagiCure  -- which can only be installed on Windows-alone systems, has an 8GB NTFS limit for storage, which translates into a one-day rollback. For a good DISK CLONING and backup program, get Macrium Reflect 5 Pro.

PS: Disk cloning of your root drive, is the only way to get back into operation 15 minutes after Windows crashes or your registry dies.  Basically, you CLONE your root drive to an external drive of the same size, and Macrium literally replaces the entire destination drive byte-for-byte, so it's an exact duplicate of your root drive.  If your target drive is SMALLER than your root drive, but the USED space is smaller than your target drive, the clone still works.  Macrium's disc cloning is swift, easy to use, and works well; but it is not automated.  I do it 1x per week, while watching TV; with automated disc-image backups on the other days.  Cloning 35-70GB takes an hour.",1
"EDIT, 1/30/13:  I bought two Win8 upgrades of the twin DVDs for each 32-bit and 64-bit.  I will install them on laptops whose drives are easily switched out post-clone, so not to disturb the original drives.  In short, clone original drive, switch it out, pop in a new drive, clone back to that drive, then partition, then put Win8 in its own partition, then switch out again.  This is one dangerous OS.  The reviews later than mine here for 1/10/13 report more horrors post-installation than I'd have imagined.  The laptops I bought for this were Dell Latitude 6530, 6510.  The other Dell laptop with an easily switched-out-drive is the D630.  But its memory is expensive.  Memory for the 6530 and 6510 runs only about $35 per 4 GB. In short, Win8 will NEVER be on a mission-critical machine, and NEVER be on a mission-critical original internal drive.  Comparable Precision models are 2400, 4400, 6500 (which uses same internal HDD as the 6530), 6600-6700.  Precision models are more expensive.  Dell's memory is easy to change (except on the D630, where the DIMM A module is below the keyboard, lol).  So if you're debating whether to install Win8, get a used Dell laptop in dellauction, DFS, or Dell Outlet.  If it's after January 31 when you want to install, don't upgrade at all.  The real cost of this upgrade is in the HUNDREDS of hours' frustration you'll have in trying to learn and use it.  For that reason, I won't install Win8 until maybe a year from now, or whenever reports of it regaining sanity and stability, come out.

Partition size should at least be 80 GB, because Win8 might impose a recovery/restore file.  That file is at least 22 GB, which is the Win7 file size.  Atop that, you need space for the Recycle Bin, paging file, other junk.  So figure 80 GB or 60 GB at smallest, for a Windows 8 partition.  Put all your other programs and files elsewhere, back up your registry regularly.  Win8 forces you to be online more often, so you are at greater risk.

Original review follows below, before the upgrades arrived.  Those upgrades are still in their little sealed boxes, unopened.  The boxes are the size of a CD.

=========
I made Youtube videos on Win8 as 'brainouty'.  My videos aren't worth watching, but the video descriptions ARE worth reading: they contain a lot of links relevant to Win8 installation and usage, from users installing, and from computer magazines online, forums, etc.  See also my posts in PC World, which often contain links to other places.  Yeah, and maybe ignore my irritation in those posts.  I need Bible's 1John1:9 every 30 seconds, when working with Windows: sorry!

Oh, understand this clearly:  I'm MIFFED that I have to move to Linux, in order to avoid this OS.  I'm not an MS hater, but an XP fan -- just bought four more XP Pro OS here in Amazon.  Linux will be used for internetting and email when the support for XP ends.  That way XP security will remain, as Linux for COMPUTERS is not popularly or easily targeted by hackers.  (Android is another story.)  Besides, XP's security has matured after 11 years.  Win8's just born, and its security is untested.

So you see: I'm not an MS hater.  That said, here's the review:

=======================================================
Windows 8 pro-purchase: none, for an experienced computer desktop user.
=======================================================

Might be worth upgrading, if you like poking touchscreens; for that's the essential difference in Win8 (ignoring the new garishly annoying 'tiles' on the Start Screen which replaces the Start Menu).  If you have big screens sitting over 8"" from your face, you won't want this software.  They made Win8 for touch, to compete with Apple and Android;  so mouse or touchpad, keyboard equivalents are awful.  Gone is the easy way to shut down, close a window, open multiple windows, change options.  It's all hide-and-seek now.  Plus, the screen response is MUCH slower.  You're supposed to get the thrill of watching a 'page' turn, the screen glide horizontally.  So it's DELIBERATELY slower.  Blecch.

MS chirpers boast about 'fast boot times'.  Honey, I had to DISABLE fast boot on my Win98, XP, VISTA, and Win7 machines, so I'd have enough time to select the boot menu at startup, in case something went wrong.  The last thing you want is fast boot times, for then you bypass your ability to STOP the machine from hanging up.  Go get a cup of coffee when you boot.  Every Windows system, if new or tuned, boots in a minute or so.  Depending on what other programs you have scheduled to run at start up, it can take longer.  But just wait:  Win8 will be as slow as molasses, just like every other Windows OS, after it ages with the many 'updates' you'll have to get, to fix the OS bugs.

MS chirpers also boast about 'safer'.  Baloney.  IE10 and the OS had security fixes in the first week!  And there are still problems.  If anything, Win8 is more susceptible to attack, because it imposes these LIVE TILES on you at boot up, and you can't really use it well unless you sign on with a Microsoft Account you create.  In short, you're ONLINE most of the time, that's what this OS is designed for;  so, you'll be under more attack, not less.

==========================================
Windows 8 contra-purchase:  keep reading this review. :)
==========================================

A) I bought it, B) I hate it, and C) it hasn't even arrived yet.  Bought it, because of the January 31 deadline, and needed to get that product key for the Media Center so at least I can play my DVD drive so I can maybe INSTALL something after Win8 disables the drive, post-installation.  NOTE: if you install 'plain' Win8, your DVD drive will become disabled;  but if you use the PRO upgrade here, the DVD/CD drives are supposed to keep working.  Will see.

B) Hate it, for 3000 reasons, most of which are covered by other reviewers, to wit:
=======================================================
1.  Installation is VERY GLITCHY.
=======================================================

So be sure to clone your existing drive with Clonezilla (be sure the destination clone drive is about the same size as the original);  both Clonezilla and the destination drives (i.e., from Jacob's parts) are here in Amazon.  Expect your drivers not to work, your internet not to work (way to go, MS, disable the customer from troubleshooting your buggy installer), your programs not to work, if you install ON TOP OF the existing OS.  Better still, first partition your drive (if drive is greater than 100 GB), and install Win8 on a newly-created and formatted PARTITION.  You can do that with Clonezilla, too (which is a flavor of Linux), but most recommend you partition a Windows disk with Windows.  So maybe do that first, before you clone.  Then do a 'custom' install to install to the partition.  Oh: and keep your data on a different drive, because from Win7 forward, RESTORE and REFRESH don't exactly work as advertised.  You lose data and programs sometimes yes, sometimes no.  NOTHING BEATS CLONING.  For the clone drive is a live and bootable copy of your hard drive.  DO IT.

REMOVE any anti-virus or disk management software prior to installation, if you'll not do a clean install.  The reviews I've read often report aborted installations due to those things (i.e., Kapersky, Norton, Acronis) being on the machine.

MAKE SURE that UEFI boot is NOT enabled;  Windows 8 changes your BIOS, if UEFI is enabled, and you really don't want that -- it will be very difficult to recover your old system if it's enabled and you decide Win8 is not for you. Basically, a 'UEFI' is a traffic cop between your OS and your machine which stops any boot without a pre-authorized 'signature' being sent to the computer;  so, your machine is effectively DEAD. But how to do this?  First, if your machine is about a year old, you may have this problem;  even then, it seems to affect only 64-bit installations.  Google on 'uefi boot option', and then find superuser(dot)com for the most comprehensive explanation on this problem I could find.  (I can't put the link in here.)

So: if you have it, you should see something like 'Legacy' or 'UEFI' on a screen, waiting for you to select it; should be in your system setup prior to booting in Windows.  If you select/enable UEFI, then maybe you won't be able to dual-boot with some other OS, later;  because, some systems thereafter HIDE the option.  So that's a problem, for Win8 DOES NOT UNINSTALL, as the instructions to the upgrade here in Amazon, warned.  If UEFI is enabled, not sure you can even clone back, to get rid of Win8. For the UEFI option creates a hidden partition on your hard drive which runs first in the boot sequence -- and maybe you can't reformat that partition, either.  Real pain in the neck.

NOTE: if you don't see a 'UEFI' option, you probably don't have it, so your computer will NOT be locked by Win8 installation.  Win8 is supposed to warn you it can't use 'secure boot', when you install: if it does, SMILE BROADLY, grateful to Heaven you're not religiously tyrannized from deciding how YOU want to use your own machine!

NOTE 2: Apparently all Dell workstations and mobile machines beginning with the Latitude 6410 (or near that vintage), have this 'UEFI' option, and you CAN turn it off (by selecting 'Legacy', instead);  the UEFI thingy began with Windows 7, in 2009.  So if your machine is older than that, you don't have it;  if you don't have Win7, you don't have the UEFI problem;  and if you have Windows 7, you'd already know about UEFI, as that was an issue in Windows 7 installation. One final way to check:  do you have an 'MBR' (master boot record) partition?  If 'yes', then likely you DO NOT have UEFI, because then an option to 'enable' it (radio button next to 'UEFI' in system setup) would be present.  Whew.

MAKE SURE that AHCI is enabled.  Again, settings are in your system setup prior to booting in Windows.  Older machines might not have AHCI, or might not have it enabled.  AHCI controls how your DVD drives work, versus your other storage (like, your internal hard drive).  Apparently Win8 glitches up if AHCI isn't enabled, as reported by some users on the internet.  Again, if you don't see an option to enable it, don't worry.

===> What's great about this Amazon deal (hence at least one star) is that you get BOTH 32-bit and 64-bit disks.  FAR BETTER TO USE THE DISKS THAN TO DOWNLOAD THE PROGRAM FROM MICROSOFT.  Most installation complaints are by people who downloaded from Microsoft for the $15 or $40.  Many problems reported:  aborted installations with many retries;  12+ hours simply to download (for MS servers control the rate, not your IP); worst of all, the download was keyed to the computer used, so (example) if you were on 32-bit Vista at the time, you got a 32-bit Win8 keyed to THAT Vista machine.  In short, the MS download is CUSTOMIZED, not generic.  So if you value your sanity, get these disks here in Amazon, instead. Pay the extra $27-52 here, unless you love waste and pain.

===> here, you get BOTH 32-bit and 64-bit, as just said.  So look: I can install Win8, yell at it, then uninstall via clone-back and install Win8 later on something else -- probably also test 64-bit (to test DOSBOX and Taos Computing's DOS emulator).  So I get two experiences for the price of one.  The 64-bit use might actually be worthwhile.  Will see.

=====================================
DVD/CD Read/Write/PLAY ISSUES, post-installation:
=====================================

Allegedly, if you're installing Win8 Pro from these disks instead of downloading from MS, your DVD drive will still work, afterwards.  I'm not taking any chances, but will download VLC player (which also works in Linux) before I shut down, post-install.  I actually plan on triple-partitioning the drive, with the existing OS first (which will likely be Vista), then Linux in some flavor, leaving a third partition for Win8. I will then custom install it to that third partition, in 32-bit.

IMPORTANT:  Windows Media Player won't necessarily work in Win8.  Instead, to play DVDs, you'll need the 'free' Media Center.  To get that, you have to go online to MS and give them your email, wait for a 'product key' to be mailed to you, which you have to use AFTER installing Win8 but BEFORE January 31.  Supposed to be five per customer, but to get that, you have to use five email addresses. If you do NOT install the 'free' version prior to January 31, your product key won't work.

SUGGESTION: Bite the bullet and pay for Media Center ($10!) after January 31, downloading it then from MS.  The downloaded PAID version will enable your Blu-Ray player;  the 'free' version will disable the Blu-Ray player.  LOL can MS give you more DISincentive to buy?  Did the people who designed this OS sit around a conference table with lattes, asking each other, 'how can we best alienate the customer, today?'

=======================================================
2.  COMPATIBILITY with hardware is also very glitchy.
=======================================================

After reading 3000 reviews here in Amazon, new egg, TigerDirect and elsewhere (i.e., in comments and in computer magazines), it seems that the following hardware is problemmatic when Win8 installs (please add comments if I missed your own hardware glitch):

* HP/Compaq computer and printer hardware -- they won't allow you to back-grade to Win7, but apparently the drivers in HP when you're not YET on Win8, don't function after Win8 installation.  Lots of problems reported, here in Amazon.
* Sony -- Sony has a lot of proprietary adjustments in their stuff, and it works or often fails when Windows installations are done.
*Graphics Cards, Nvidia or ATI Radeon -- problems with the drivers not being compatible.
*Touchpads -- maybe won't work post-installation.
*PROCESSORS -- Pentium 4 won't work, but Windows 8 advisor claims it will.  Some other processors might not work, as well.  In short, your installation might abort, or after installation and shutdown you might not be able to get the machine on again, due to the processor being incompatible.  But you won't know that, nothing tells you what's the problem.
*WEBCAMS -- Logitech in particular might not work.  Don't know if any embedded laptop webcams will work.  Driver problems.
*ROUTERS in your house. This too is a driver problem.  Some routers really have problems with Win8, so maybe first go to your router maker's site and see if there are any known problems.  Or, Google.
*64-bit installations are more prone to problems than 32-bit.  So if you have 32-bit now, STAY on it.  You can always change later, especially since you get both 32-bit and 64-bit installers in this Amazon-purchased package.
*1GB-RAM machines.  Win8 is supposed to be more compatible with low memory, but Pro requires 2GB, and you really need 4GB if you want smooth operation.  It's really tough to play videos or surf with 1GB, unless you have good broadband like XFINITY.  So if you have XFINITY, reserve your 1GB machine for internet and your TV hookup, or upgrade your RAM before moving to Win8 Pro.
*Upgrades from Windows prior to Win7 are more glitchy.  CLONE FIRST.  You can only migrate your settings from Vista, and you can't migrate anything from XP.  So that will mean lost programs, lost drivers, lost a lot of things.  When my registry died on my XP in May-June (twice), it cost me three months to rebuild the thing, for back then I didn't know about cloning.  So CLONE FIRST.  Costs $8 for Clonezilla CD (I like their $60 USB, too), and maybe $30-$100 for an external hard drive the same size as your internal drive.  WORTH IT.

--->  Ask people you know, who HAPPILY installed Win8 on their machines, what brands and processors, graphics cards, etc. that they have.  Frankly, you can spend $200 and just buy a cheap netbook to try Win8, leaving your main machine alone.  Then buy the upgrade here, if you're happy with Win8 function.  If not happy, you can always sell the cheap netbook here on Amazon, or to a friend. :)

Dell machines seem to be the most compatible with Win8.  So I'm buying a Dell D630 to use as my test machine.

=======================================================
3.  COMPATIBILITY with software is weird and conflicting.
=======================================================

Win8 will tell you it can't handle MS Office prior to 2010, but users tell me they can even get old Office 2000 on their Win8's.  I'll be testing it with DOS Lotus 1-2-3 version 2.01, on 32-bit Win8, and other software from 2003 and prior.  That's why I got Win8, to see first-hand how bad it is.  Most of the software-incompatible complaints come from 64-bit or Adobe and Photoshop users.  Graphics display problems, colors wrong, formatting weird, colorspace problems in particular.  Probably every utility program you had pre-Win8, won't work.  Anything which makes direct calls to the hardware or to the OS, or uses context menus in prior versions of Windows, will likely not install or cause the machine to freeze.  Same problem happens in Win7, especially with respect to programs that use the context menu (meaning: the pop-up menu when you right-click, in XP, Vista, Win7).

DEALBREAKER?  YOU LOSE YOUR EMAIL CLIENT after installation. Win8 is not compatible with old Win7 mail, nor Vista Mail, and of course isn't compatible with Outlook Express.  So move your mail to full Outlook, back up, then pray.  If you only use online email composition, then you might actually prefer Win8, because if you create an MS account when you first install, it will then take you through the steps to consolidate your email: but you can't compose offline.  I hate composing online, so I hate this 'new' feature.  But Outlook 2010 might work for you.  I don't like any Outlook after 2000, so will try and install that, see if it works.

=======================================================
4.  NAVIGATION in Win8 is disorienting.
=======================================================

Remember Kurt Vonnegut's 'Breakfast of Champions'?  Where the guy was in WWII Dresden, then suddenly on a planet living in a glass orb -- watched by aliens -- having no idea or control how he'd flip from one world to the other?  Win8 works just like that book/movie!  One minute you're in the desktop, doing something normal and productive, then ZAP!  You're back in the Start Screen again!  Why?  Because something you did in the desktop, actually called forth some program in the Start Screen TEMPORARILY, after which you're supposed to return to the desktop.  But, sometimes you don't.  It's kinda like going into your bedroom to pick up the socks, then you see the plant needs watering so you go to the kitchen, then you see the dishes need doing so you wash them.. and then you forgot about both plant and socks.

Guess guess ugly interface schizoid operation made for XBox kiddies who have no discernment except to poke at a screen.  Just go look at the Youtube videos on Win8, watch how they navigate and use the OS, and you'll see how it works.  It's not hard to learn, it's ANNOYING to learn and even MORE ANNOYING to use.  MS hates its customers, always wants to make them play 'guess how to find me or use me' with each new OS they put out.  And in Win8, they want to control your 'experience' to seeing EASTER EGG HUNT TILES OF MS PRODUCTS when you boot up.  Really childish.  As a result, I'll gradually move to Linux.  But I still have to buy ONE copy of this garbage to learn it, in case a client asks me how to send an email or open a file, and all he has, is Win8.

=================================================================================
5.  OPERATION of value will be its desktop, which allegedly is like Win7.  But ooops: no Start Menu!
=================================================================================

A Start Menu in prior versions of Windows was handy to organize and 'park' your program shortcuts.  YOU chose where they were organized, YOU designed the folders and icons and whatever to remind YOU what and where they were, and YOU controlled how YOU wanted to see that stuff displayed.  Totally.  Well, that productive tool -- in use since Windows 95 -- is gone, in Win8.  Seriously:  it's as if MS had INTENDED to destroy the best interface features of Windows.  So of course, you can't customize the icons and background, like before.  God forbid you want to preserve your eyesight by muted shades and graphics, rather than GLARE TILES with a GLARE background, no matter what color you choose, excepting sleepy gray!  Windows 3.1, all over again!

Here, the MS chirpers will chorus that many THIRD PARTY add-ins restore your Start Menu.  Not really. There are hundreds of these programs you must TRY and then INSTALL and then USE to recover some of the functionality you had.  But now you spent effort and time searching through all these programs; every update to Win8, will maybe necessitate updating these programs, too.  So guess what? Now your day is spent on tweaking and updates.. not on working.  Did someone in Redmond call an in-house meeting, on 'How To Create World Inflation. Quickly'?

So I wonder how No-Win8, will truly resemble Win7.  XP is far better than both; but Win7 happily formats DVDs; its MovieMaker 6.0 is fabulous.  Win7's Help actually helps (what a shock).  Excepting Explorer (that Win8 essentially obliterates) Win7's reorganized options are pretty decent and intuitive.  So I'm dying to see if I can override Win8's interface the way I overrode Win7, resulting in a 'classic' interface (meaning, like Win98, replete with Start Menu!) across all my (soon to be 14) Windows machines.  See my 'Vista versus Win7' thread in PC World, if you're interested in that.

======================

C) So my Win8 Pro upgrade will arrive in a few days, allowing me to buy a Dell D630 for Win8 installation.  Someone here in the Amazon comments said that model worked well with Win8. The Dell machine's design is fabulous -- internal hard drive, just slides out after removing two screws on the back!  Machine is for sale here in Amazon.  I made a video on it, too.

Alas, the D630's memory is slow, only 800MHz.  Still, that moseying RAM fits the pokey Win8 OS:  for you are expected to SIGH or drool,  while its tiles waft lazily across the screen, just as in any tablet;  then, you again swipe, sigh, drool.. one 'page' of tiles at a time.  Oh wait: you can also type the first three or four letters of the file you want, and magically 'search' appears with the many tiles answering that description.  Hmmm.  So now you have to TYPE and SWIPE?  Sheesh.

So I won't do a more personal review, for awhile.  Then my rant here will gradually suffer edit. I did nearly six months of intensive research on Win8 installation and operation, prior to buying.  Still, would love to be wrong -- if the 'right' answer is good.  :)",1
"Eight long years after its last real update of Quicken for Mac (version 2007 in August 2006), and some four years after release of its ""Quicken Essentials for Mac"" downgrade, Intuit finally released a ""new"" personal finance software product for Mac.

Is it, at last, the cross-platformed Quicken, compatible with *any* Quicken for Windows version, that Mac users have been telling Intuit we needed for 26 years, since the first ""Quicken for Mac"" in 1989? No.

Is there even a free download trial version of it, as there is with the far more capable, better supported, and cheaper full-featured personal finance software for Mac, iBank 5+, Moneydance and SEE Finance? No.

If you want to try Quicken for Mac 2015, you have to fork out up to $80-plus (more than competitors) to discover a software product that, just like ""Quicken Essentials for Mac"", yet again lacks many essential features even of obsolete Quicken for Mac 2007, let alone lacking full cross-platform compatibility in the Quicken range.

Intuit obstinately continues to deny its Mac customers the one Quicken for Mac which might be impressive: a Quicken for Mac with the same basic design and ALL features of the popular and successful Quicken for Windows, and capacity to read, write and work back and forth on native files between the two. I cannot identify any other high profile productivity software, with the same brand name in both Mac OS and Windows, which cannot read and write mutually compatible files without conversion. Intuit, with its mutually *incompatible* Quickens, stands out as a unique repeat offender in what is factually a gross form of deception. Many consumers evidently are misled to the reasonable, but false assumption current versions of Quicken are equal across platforms.

In fact, this product should not be called Quicken for Mac: there is not, and never has been, any such thing as a real Quicken For Mac. The so-called ""Quicken For Mac"" product line should be given a name that reflects its incompatible, standalone, feature-poor reality. Call it *anything* else but Quicken... ""Lacking For Mac"", ""Quacken For Mac"" or ""Slacken For Mac"" would be more appropriate product names.

Intuit's absurd, abominable, *abysmal* performance with Quicken for Mac has gone beyond a joke into the realm of insult to the Mac personal finance software customer community. Intuit again is vaguely promising to add missing features -- from a long list of missing features -- at some unspecified time in the future. Seem familiar to anyone? It's the post-Quicken for Mac 2007 vaporware song and dance routine all over again, re-enacted by the all-time star performer and unbeatable industry champion of Mac vaporware, Intuit Inc.

Many of even the most sympathetic and long-term devotees of Quicken for Mac now are puzzled and perplexed. This is amply summed up by the following two posts in the Intuit Quicken Community website on 22 August 2014. They appear under the exasperated original poster's heading, 'Why, after all this time, has Intuit produced a subpar version of Quicken for the Mac called Quicken 2015?'

""Quicken 2015

""This product is an extension of Quicken Essentials. It remains far behind Quicken 2007 and its predecessors in its ability to select and report data. It has many arcane features such as the ""pickers."" These are useless for those of us with many categories. How does one readily select (report) all but one category ... there is no practical way, for example.

""The user interface, Yosemite-like it is, is a retrograde step compared even to Quicken Essentials. I find, on a 27"" iMac, the register listing to be virtually unusable. The numbers and columns do not readily stand out, as with Quicken Essentials and Quicken 2007.

""That's a problem.

""Unfortunately, I will stick with Quicken Essentials until I can find a third-party alternative. Quicken was a great product when I started using it a decade or two ago. But it's been downhill since the mid-2000's -- why oh why?""

""The answer to your question is a long and winding road of Intuit's on-and-off development of Mac software since shortly after Quicken 2007 came out 8 years ago. The Quicken 2007 software uses building blacks that Apple has stopped supporting in the modern Mac OS, and parts of the code are 20+ years old. They set out to build a new version, called Quicken Financial Life for Mac, which never came to market. Then they set out to build a new core of Quicken, which came to market in 2010 as Quicken Essentials. A full version of Quicken Deluxe was promised for the following year, but for reasons I've never read about, that effort was killed and the development team was disbanded. Then in 2012, they hired a new development team to build on the work that had been done for Essentials to create a full-fledged modern version of Quicken for Mac -- and this release of Quicken 2015 is the first step in a multi-step process.

""It represents a significant enhancement to Quicken Essentials, but it is missing many features users desire from Quicken 2007. In a departure for Intuit, the Mac development team has been allowed to pre-announce that there will be a series of free updates to Quicken 2015 as they continue programming to build out the features of the program. For the benefit of Essentials users who have not had updates, and Quicken for Windows users hanging onto old PCs or WinXP virtual machines, they decided it was better to complete, test, and release a version of Quicken 2015 that doesn't do everything today, and add to it over time -- rather than spending another year in the lab trying to develop a full-featured version that would satisfy everyone.

""The product manager has said publicly that this first release of Quicken 2015 won't meet everyone's needs, and they've been very upfront about the features not present in Quicken 2015. The hope is that development will continue at a good pace, and additional investment tools, better reports, and other features will follow in the months ahead. Quicken 2015 today doesn't meet all my needs, but I'm encouraged that it seems to be headed in the right direction. And most importantly, it represents a tangible re-commitment to having a robust Quicken for Mac from Intuit management.""

My final comment: ""jacobs, Superuser"" 's assessment that Quicken for Mac 2015 ""represents a tangible re-commitment to having a robust Quicken for Mac from Intuit management"" is consistent with the hopeful expressions which have greeted this product from the eternal optimists of Quicken's shrunken, battered Mac customer base. Unfortunately, this sentiment represents the triumph of hope over experience.

It is long past time for Intuit to deliver a *real* Quicken for Mac, and to send the de facto Lacking For Mac product line to the knackery. I, for one, migrated my 14 years of detailed Quicken for Mac data in 2012 to iBank, a genuine cutting edge full-featured personal finance application, frequently updated and very well supported. I have looked at, and have been impressed also by Moneydance, which is particularly notable as being a true cross-platform application -- something Quicken was ideally placed to be, but never has been, from the 1990s to now. (iBank 5+ is a Mac OS and iOS-only application, but with exceptionally flexible file import and export features, including better compliance with Intuit's own QIF file exchange format than some Quicken-branded products.)

After more than eight years of empty promises and Mac vaporware from Intuit since Quicken for Mac 2007, I refuse to drink any more Quicken for Mac Kool-Aid. I have experienced, firsthand, the entire history of personal finance software on Mac because I have kept financial accounts on my Macs almost every day since 1984/85 (initially using a long-forgotten product called Dollars & $ense, then Quicken, MYOB and iBank, and Microsoft Excel in Mac and Windows as a financial calculation and reporting application since version 1.0). I am totally unimpressed by Quicken for Mac 2015.

In my earlier review of Quicken Essentials for Mac at http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RBWLK74B6EPJ/ I wrote, in part, that Intuit's epic failure to properly update Quicken for Mac amounted to ""the worst betrayal of customer loyalty and dashed customer hopes in the entire history of Mac software"". I described Quicken Essentials for Mac as ""a toy plastic knife for the tasks of skinning the personal finance grizzly bear"". Quicken for Mac 2015, with features that place it somewhere between the toy-town accounting Quicken Essentials and the obsolete Quicken for Mac 2007, merely strengthens my conviction of having been absolutely correct in earlier negative assessments. Indeed, the outrageous con Intuit has foisted on consumers with Quicken for Mac 2015 shows I have been far too mild, not harsh enough in my past criticism, excessively restrained in spraying this product line with caustic metaphors. No other software maker has a track record to rival Intuit in repeated releases, and the most assiduous neglectful nurture, of Mac products which are the software equivalent of ox carts hyped up as Teslas, Sopwith Camels in F-22 Raptor livery, or Barbie Dolls pitched as peers of Gisele Bndchen. I recommend the same response to every other Mac personal finance user.

I also recommend extreme caution and skepticism when reading ALL positive reviews of this mediocre, bottom-rung product. The pattern of four and five star, one and two line unsubstantiated positive reviews, often posted around same dates from sock puppet accounts that have posted nothing or little else, is highly suspicious. The overall average star rating, which has been skewed upwards by these highly suspicious (in any case, unreliable) reviews, should be entirely ignored. On all the facts, and in comparison with Intuit's own Windows range and other manufacturers' superior competing products for Mac, Quicken (Lacking) for Mac 2015 is a genuine one-star item: the lowest of the low, just another ""toy plastic knife for the tasks of skinning the personal finance grizzly bear"".

POSTSCRIPT (23 June 2015)

Being an incurably curious masochist, I purchased the boxed version of Quicken for Mac 2015 over the counter from a reputable retailer in Philadelphia in April 2015. The cost was $80.99 including Pennsylvanias 6% sales tax. Intuit's anti-customer policies and attitudes had prevented me, as a non-US resident, buying the online download, or the boxed version, until my next visit to the US.

My hands-on experience of this awful product has confirmed my lowest assessments of it derived from pre-purchase research. I tested it two ways: 1. importing my old Quicken for Mac 2007 file via the QfM 2015 conversion (note: it converts, it does not read or write QfM 2007 data), and 2. starting a new file from scratch.

Almost a year has passed since the initial release of QfM 2015 in August 2014, but the latest update version 2.5.0 has added no significant features to redress any major deficiency of the initial release. Most astonishing of all, Intuit seems still not to have worked out that many Mac users travel, work, earn, spend and invest outside the United States and in more than one country and currency.

""Quicken for Mac 2015"" is not even basic: it is sub-standard, for all the reasons I and other reviewers and comment writers have set out in great detail.

Mac personal finance software ""basic"" includes 1. Multiple currency support, and 2. Ability to read and write native files between any same-branded products on Mac OS and Windows.

Quicken for Mac 2015 cannot do ""basic"", despite being the latest iteration of the Quicken for Mac line which was launched 26 years ago in 1989. It is the longest-running personal finance product line for Mac, yet it is the *least capable* product in the entire field. As stated above, at least three competing products in the field, iBank 5+, Moneydance 2014+ and SEE Finance, are years - even decades - ahead of Quicken for Mac on most criteria. QfM 2015 is as capable of meeting ""basic"" personal finance needs as an ox cart is capable of meeting a car buyer's basic need for transportation because it has wheels.

QfM 2015 deficiencies and flaws are innumerable, but here are a few more in addition to those specified above and in the 80-plus comments attached to this review:

 Currency on converted file defaults to USD$. If you want to change that, no preference setting is available across the entire file: it is necessary to go into the settings for each account and change it there.

 Each account can be set to different currencies  but no currency exchange rate conversion in Quicken is possible!

 QfM 2015 deviates from long-established accounting practice in terminology, accounts structure and reports. Look in vain for a balance sheet, cash flow or other such standard report.

 When starting a new file from scratch there are no standard charts of accounts or category sets for common purposes such as household accounting, small business, or other common user profiles.

* Cannot import or convert multiple currency transactions from Quicken for Windows or other multiple currency capable applications.

 Conversion from Quicken 2007 for Mac will not carry over scheduled transactions.

 QfM 2015 by default saves its data file in the Library folder, a folder intended only to contain auxiliary system or application files like fonts and preferences. There is no File>Save As command. The Quicken working data file can be moved, but with a non-standard File>Move To command.  No other Mac database application I ever have seen works this way, for good reason: saving working data in a System-related folder is not compliant with Mac OS design, and could get novice Mac users into trouble.",1
"Another update 1/2/16:  I downloaded and installed an update to this software, thinking maybe they had worked out the bugs  I went to create a video off of eight HD files that we shot on a recent vacation trip, intending to burn it onto a Blue-ray disk.  After about three hours of rendering, once again, the software became unresponsive and froze up.  My one-star review stands....avoid this one, unless you want to spend your money on nothing but frustration.

After writing the review below, I tried two things.  First, I tried to go back and produce the same video via the Easy Editor option that I had tried the first time to no avail.  Once again, the program started rendering the file and it took hours...and it finally froze my computer...so it failed for me twice.

Second, I tried to play the disk that I had finally produced as mentioned below, and my DVD player simply stated ""disk not recognized.""  So, even the DVD I did finally manage to create is unplayable.

I really can't recommend this software....I suggest you try one of the Corel products instead.  I seriously question whether or not Cyberlink runs beta tests on products like this prior to releasing them to the market.  This ended up being nothing but a time wasting, frustrating experience for me.

Original review here:
Let me say first of all that I am not a professional video producer by any means.  Im just a dad who likes to catch home movies of family vacations, birthdays, graduations, etc. on video and then transfer them over to a disk, either through Blue-ray or through AVCHD formats.  I like to put a snazzy title at the beginning, put some subtitles in along the way that explains where we were and when, and chop out those moments when I forgot to turn off the camcorder and we get to see what footwear everyone was wearing that day.

The best software I have found so far has been Corel VideoStudio Pro X7.  It allows me to do all of the above very easily.

I took about 90 minutes of HD video that I have on an SD card and gave this PowerDirector 14 software from Cyberlink a shot.  It proved to be fairly frustrating for me, far more so that what I have experienced with the Corel software.

When you open the software for the first time, you have to put in your key code, which I found odd because this is usually requested when you load the software onto your computer, not when you first open it.  Anyway, once that was done, a screen come up that gives you five choices: 1) Full Feature Editor, 2) Easy Editor, 3) Express Project, 4) Theme Designer, and 5) Slide Show Creator.  The second and third choices are supposedly easier to navigate...created for novices like me, allowing you to progress upward at your own pace to do more things, and arguably more complicated things, with your video production.

I chose Easy Editor.  First I had to load my files, and I did this by either importing a file or a folder, which was fairly straight forward, and took a few minutes because I had around 280 HD files.  It would pop up occasionally telling me that an error had occurred, which was actually images it was trying to load that I had embedded into my video files (my camcorder automatically takes photos when it sees a smiling face).

It then moves to a Style section that gives you a choice, albeit rather limited, of title frames to put on your video.  After this, you go to an Adjustment section where you can add music, and then you click on a Preview section where you get Magic Style is analyzing your movieplease wait.

This is where things fell apart for me.  I waited.and waited.and waitedand after several hours the little bar that indicates its progress got to about 59%, and then the software became unresponsive.  By this time it was 10:00 at night (and I had started the process that afternoon), so I finally just shut the project down and called it a day.

Not one to give up, the next day I tried Express Project, and struggled for a while to figure out how to capture the files from my SD card.  I finally ended up dragging the files to the timeline.  This time the choices for the title frame were even sparser for some reason, but I picked one and off I went.  The entire process this time took me about two hours.

At the end, when you are about to burn to disk, you have a myriad of choices for file sizes and formats for the burnjust make sure you have the right media to accommodate this.  At first I tried to use a DVD+R DL disk, but no matter what format I selected, the disk was too small for the size of the project.  I finally ended up burning a Blue-ray disk.

Its also worth noting that I have a fairly powerful PCwith an Intel Core i7 processor and 12GB of RAM.  I suggest you make sure you have some fairly serious horsepower for this software if you elect to purchase it.  For HD editing, they recommend 6GB of memory for a 64 bit OS (which I have) and for 4K editing.

Although my first attempt to use this software was met with frustration, I am sure things will improve as I use it more and I learn its unique features.  It has MANY great capabilities, including editing and producing 4K video, which is the main reason I wanted it.  I have a 4K television, and plan to get a 4K camcorder soon.

However, to be quite honest here, if you are just a family video guy like me and don't really need all the whistles and bells, I suggest you go with something a bit more basic, like the VideoStudio Pro X7 I mentioned early.

But, if you think you might want to get into the video production world a bit heavier and have software that is future proofed to at least some degree, this option from CyberLink is definitely a great choice.  Just be prepared to put some time in to learn all of its features.they are substantial.  I plan to stick with it and try to learn as many as I can, time permitting.  In the time it has taken me to render on DVD with PowerDirector, I could have produced three or four with VideoStudio.

I hope my experience has helped you to some degree.  If you have any questions feel free to ask, and as I use it more, should things change, I will update the review.  Thanks for reading!",1
"UPDATE to review, 2/12/13: yes you CAN make MS Office 2002-2000 run in Win7, if Win7 is previously installed.  I just installed both on my Dell laptops (Lat 6530 and 6510) which I just bought in January.  In PC World, they maintain you can also install those same MS versions in Win8, but I'm so antagonistic to Win8 I've not installed it, yet.  Original review follows below.

==================

Imagine, if you will, the annual How-to-Alienate-the-Customer Meeting in Redmond, Washington, aka 'upgrade' plan, for MS software.

Ms. Snippy (proudly):  Well, we've redesigned the interface yet again, just like aisles in grocery stores, so the customer will be confused, feel stupid; so will subscribe to our paid help.  Yet we added a cute dog to slow the search process, make it harder to search than prior;  we also reduced the number and types of files search can read, and made the Indexing Service more annoying.  We also forced the interface colors to glare blue and glare white, to increase eyestrain. Thus we can truly call this product 'new'.

Mr. Fleece-the-Customer Project Manager (smiling):  Wonderful, Snippy! But is that all?  Those changes won't confuse the customer long enough;  soon they will stop subscribing to our ignorant help hot lines.

Ms. Snippy (bubbling over): Oh, we've done much more.  Starting with, reducing backwards-compatibility with our own earlier software, and popular programs like Lotus 1-2-3 and Adobe Acrobat; so now it will cost those companies more, to sync with our 'new' software.  And less of their own products, will be read by OUR software, just the same!

Mr. Fleece (eyes wide):  aha, so we can blame them for lack of compatibility, and make more money thereby.  Well done, Snippy!

Ms. Snippy (ecstatic):  Well, here's the best part: we create NEW JOBS!  For now ALL the older material must be retyped or reformatted within our own products, thousands of hours of NEW WORK spent on old material which used to be converted in an instant!  That extra work, is good for America!

Mr. Fleece (with the Arm-and-Hammer look):  yes, teaches the customer a lesson that he shouldn't go anywhere but to us!  for all his software needs.

Ms. Nudger (sheepishly):  Um, excuse me.  We've also made our own earlier products incompatible with the 'new' version.  So how do we blame the other software companies, when in fact we also are incompatible with our own products?

Mr. Fleece:  Can't you recognize 'progress'?  It's the policy here to force people to upgrade, upgrade, upgrade, never ending, never matching, never fitting the past -- just like DETROIT proudly does with American cars!  You're UNAMERICAN, Nudger; and you're FIRED!

===========

The above fictional conversation is not wholly fictional.  Eleven years ago, my one and only pay-for-help hour spent with a Microsoft employee basically resulted in him admitting Fleece's last lines.  In the name of progress.  I kid you not.  The rest of the fictional conversation is easily deduced by the actual history of MS products.  So too, here with Word 2003, when the elimination of backwards-compatibility, really begins.  Later versions of Office are even worse.  I've tried and rejected them.  But after reading reviews of how Word 2003 allegedly fixed the bugs with respect to right-to-left text (i.e., Hebrew), I wanted to try this.  Yeah, what a mistake!  Two copies I bought, both of them nearly useless!

Why?  Um, if you can't even retrieve your own previous files in the 'upgrade' version, then why upgrade?  Hmmmm?

For every 'upgrade' of Office becomes more and more dysfunctional.  I bought Word 2003 due to the many bugs in Word 2000-2002, but guess what?  Word 2003 TOOK AWAY what was good in those older programs, and substituted even more bugs and dysfunctionality.  That 'progress' continues from Word 2003, onward.  OFFICE and hence Word 2010 is so incompatible, after downloading the trial version in only two hours I was so frustrated, I uninstalled it. With difficulty.

Here's the scam: the 'upgrades' are like the opening dialogue, above.  The 'upgrades' complicate procedures which were simple in earlier versions, especially in Word and Excel, prior to version 2003.  For example, you used to just click on Help, and you actually got a chm file OF Help.  Not now.  Now, the DEFAULT in Word takes you ONLINE.  Takes two hours to figure out how to change that default, so you can get the old help file you're used to.  So too, the ? in a dialogue box USED to function simply: you clicked on the ?, then moved your mouse to the section on the dialogue box you wanted to understand, and got a semi-coherent explanation of that section's function.  Not now.  Now, another dialogue box opens with a lot more text, and you must SCROLL SCROLL SCROLL to find the item you could have gotten in 2 seconds, under the old method.  With no more coherence, of course.  Often, even less.  Help like this:  if the dialogue box says 'make operation operational', of course you have no idea what 'operation' is in view.  So in the old days, you clicked on ? and you got a tool tip which said, 'this function makes the operation, operational'.  That of course elucidated nothing, but at least it was fast.  Now, in Word 2003, you get the same message, but it took you three or four minutes to even FIND the same line of text as in the dialogue box, within the new and de-proved help file.  That is, after you spent two hours figuring out how to turn off the default ONLINE help which of course never helped you, either.

It's not by accident that most law firms still offer backwards-compatible documents for Word97-2003.  They have to.  Legal and accounting stuff has to be kept for YEARS.  Notice the range of the offering.  2003 and prior.  Word 2003, however, is far less desirable than prior versions: its clipboard is worse, its buttons are harder to customize and actually they removed some useful button customizations like Reveal Formatting;  the PERMISSION annoyance (covered below) means you might have to go through all your old documents and establish permissions, even on your own computer (problem on XP Pro, not Home).  And frankly, I don't see any functions which are improved, versus Word 2002.  Only new annoyances.

The usual company retort to complaints like mine, is to deem the customer ignorant of computers, puh!  Balderdash.  I've been working with computers since Trash-80.  I still have my old 286's, and they still work.  Admirably.  So it's not like I'm a computer neophyte, and my business depends on word processing and spreadsheets.  To date, nothing beats Multimate II (a DOS product) for merges, and DOS (not Windows) Lotus 1-2-3 version 2.x, for calculations.  All Excel has to offer, is formatting the final product.

To wit:  oh, now in Excel 2003, you can't retrieve Lotus 1-2-3 wk1 files, but get a 'restricted policy' notice.  By the way, this very 'policy' is itself buggy.  If I use XP Home, I don't get the problem.  It only occurs with XP Pro.  See?  MS products don't work with each other.  That lone $90 hour I spent paying for MS help years ago, resulted in this gem of explanation:  each programmer only gets certain subroutines to write.  The programmers are isolated, and don't get to see how the product fits together.  So OF COURSE there will be bugs.  Design requires a wholistic approach, which at MS, is anathema.  Okay, then: their products will waste billions of dollars in customer time trying to work around the bugs.  Not to mention, eventually MS will tank due to such a stupid policy.  But I digress...

Back to the problem: you can't open your own files when you are the administrator?  And you're not told how to get permission?  Oh, wait: you can ONLY get permission if you use Microsoft's ONLINE PASSPORT SERVICE?  Access to your own computer not online, depends on you establishing credentials online? Oh but yes!  You download a silly 'rights management' program which you can't even install, unless you subscribe to NET passport ONLINE, which means to access your own files on your own computer to use them in Office, you have to BE online, establish your credentials, and only THEN can you open your own documents on your own computer.  What drunk thought of that?  And of course, if MS voluntarily ends the PASSPORT program, then you can't even do that convoluted and needless procedure to open your own documents on your own computer offline.

So MS won't even allow you the administrator to control your own computer, with Word 2003. So here's the scam workaround: you have to settle for XP Home, or contact them in Redmond; of course you wait for an hour on the phone, then for $90 per hour they will be happy to spend four more hours 'helping' you to solve THEIR OWN TYRANNICAL BUG.  Of course, the 'help' person at MS knows absolutely nothing about the software, so first you go through irrelevant questions like do you have a virus, in order to eat up time and cost you more money.

Forget the other junk in the Suite.  It works not at all.  The Outlook 2003 was so badly designed I just flat removed it.

Excel is totally retarded, for audit-trail accounting.  Everything about its structure is buggy and arcane.  I spent FOUR HOURS today, just trying to figure out why it wouldn't recognize a labelled number, as a LABEL.  Previous version of Excel had the opposite bug: if you typed in a number, it automatically treated it as a label, unless you put an equals or plus or minus sign in front of the number.  Sheesh.  But at least Excel 2002 and prior, would recognize the label marker and treat what followed AS a label.  (This matters: say you're doing billing like I was, and you wanted to LABEL a billing amount, to keep it out of your totals;  in Excel 2002 and prior, you can do that easily.  But NOT, in Excel 2003, and no FUNCTION formula will let you do it.  More could be said, but then I'll have apoplexy.)

By contrast, old DOS Lotus 1-2-3 version 2.x -- which IBM owns now, and won't sell -- along with its add-in (nee: Funk Software) 'Worksheet Utilities' is totally superior, especially for actuarial and other number-intensive, date-intensive, audit-trail-intensive calculations.  Runs in a DOS window in XP, and I'm told by my computer guys that I can get a DOS window in Win7, so might upgrade to Win7.  Whew.  Calculation in our modern computers is instantaneous.  DOS rocks.  So too, that version of Lotus.  Later versions don't work well with dates.  Forget the later Quattro Pro, too.

Excel's only good for formatting the final reports, and even then inanely won't let you store print STYLES without extreme effort: you do it by setting up your windows, print area, then name the whole thing as a CUSTOM VIEW.  Forget macros.

I could spend hours ranting about the flaws in Word or Office Professional, vintage 2010 backwards.  Word is totally incapable of a decent merge, for example.  The trouble you have to go to in order to make merging work in Word, means that unless you've got thousands of records, you might as well do it by hand.  And with thousands of records, count on half of them coming out wrong unless yhou spend thousands of hours designing a very precise database which is thirty times harder to manage, versus the old DOS days.  Unbelievable.  No wonder prices rise so much.  We're all spending downtime trying to get basic word processing functions, to work!

So too, forget Front Page;  it's easier to write your own html code in Word.  Business Contact Manager?  You're better off with pencil and paper!  Access?  Someone on crack designed it. The Photo thingy isn't all that bad, but its bugs abound.  Outlook 2003 is the worst.  They removed all the flexibility of earlier Outlook versions, and of course made the interface completely frustrating, to boot.  Outlook has always been way overcomplicated, but if you have a lot of stuff to juggle and you use it daily (which you must, or you'll forget how) -- it can be helpful.  Simpler is old Sidekick in DOS.  Sigh, you can't store it in the UMB, in Windows.  But it works just fine on an old 486...

So instead of reading only my ranting -- Google on a MS program name, add the word 'sucks' -- you'll find even whole discussion forums devoted to that second word.  Usually such vulgar language is inapt.  But not here.  Every swear word ever invented, belongs to Office products and to MS software in general.  It's deliberately unintuitive, confusing, buggy and mediocre, so you have to subscribe to paid help.  That's the only explanation which makes sense of the data. Same can be said for Adobe, Roxio, Symantec and Corel products.  So MS isn't the only scammer in town.

Go back to DOS software:  its products work well on these faster machines.

===============

UPSHOT:  If you are lonely and want to spend all your free time debugging MS Office gaffes, then buy Word 2003 or Office Professional 2003 et seq. If on the other hand you like me are stuck with Word and want to know the latest version which worked -- though buggy, is manageable -- get Office 2002 or 2000.  Best was Word97, but getting it to work in XP is something of a problem.  Hope you kept your Win98SE machines. :)

So now, I just uninstalled Word 2003, and go back to Word 2002.  At least they don't prohibit you from accessing your own files!  Gotta install it now, byeeee.",1
"While I like non-alcohol-based rinses, I was not pleased with this. On the plus side, it provides the same benefits as other rinses and does it without the burning sensation I get from those with alcohol. Plus, the lack of alcohol helps me deal with chronic dry mouth issues (alcohol rinses and mouthwashes make dry mouth much worse).

But how a rinse tastes is important since you'll be tasting it for some time after use. This was overly sweet rather than ""fresh mint"" tasting like other rinses (such as ACT). The aftertaste remained sweet to the point where it was unpleasant.

I'm was concerned about the potential for tooth staining. I've not had any issues with that so far with this rinse, but it was a concern.

If you like really sweet tasting rinses this may be worth a shot. For me, however, it was not something I'd use again.",2
"I've been using Norelco rotary shavers for the last 20+ years. I've always found them to work well and be fairly comfortable. After a few years use, instead of replacing the heads and/or battery again, I pick up the latest top of the line Norelco that's available. The Arcitec 1090 looked awesome, and I was looking forward to using it when I received it. What a disappointing product. Bottom line, it does not work nearly as well as my Quadra Action or SmartTouch XL models. I gave it some time thinking maybe my skin needed to adjust to it, but it has not improved. It just gives a mediocre, uncomfortable shave. I've since returned it, and ordered new heads for my older Norelco. I would seriously think twice before spending $200 on this product.",2
"These are typical inexpensive spa accessories, good for several uses but not particularly durable, in the case of the moisturizing gloves, and very susceptible to mold and mildew, in the case of the bath mitts.

The moisturizing gloves are stretchy, so they fit almost any adult hand and stay on all night.  They are made of  90% unbleached cotton with Spandex.

The body-loving bath mitt has a terry made of rayon (so-called bamboo fiber that is claimed to be naturally antibacterial, but which is neither) on one side for gentle smoothing and jute loops on the other for more aggressive exfoliation.

The boucl mitt has a stretchy, open weave of unidentified fiber to provide moderate exfoliation.

They are all slightly better than dollar store quality, but definitely not up to what I would expect from Pr de Provence.  I would at least expect proper labelling of the materials used in adherence with FTC regulations regarding rayon made from bamboo and no false claims, as a minimum.",2
"Note: The company has several products linked together which can lead to a misleading / confusing time reading reviews. This is for the booties.

I was really excited to try these moisturizing booties. Unfortunately, they did not love up to my expectations. First of all, I thought they would moisturize my feet just by wearing them as indicated in the name. They don't. You are supposed to put cream or lotion on your feet before putting them on. This means that the cream/lotion is moisturizing your feet, not the booties. I used to rub lotion on my feet and then wear socks to bed which does the same thing.

I wore these booties to bed and they immediately started annoying me. They have thick seams right at the toes and again at the heel. I couldn't stop rubbing the seams trying to make them more comfortable. Do they help hold in the heat and allow the lotion to really moisturize? Yes. So do socks. I have a pair of really soft, fluffy socks that have the same effect and are more comfortable.

Sadly, I cannot recommend these booties. I would suggest getting a really comfortable pair of socks and using them for the same thing. You can probably find them cheaper and they will work just as well.",2
"Maybe I don't get the point with this. Okay, they use sex to sell it; I get that. It's supposed to create a situation in which women - I'm assuming really dumb ones - are made out of control in your presence after using it. Right. And Yaks fly.

But is there anything truly unique about it?

Well, it does have sandpaper sides, one of which would remove the face off a statue and other that buffs your flesh to a tender red. But other than that it's just sort of a sponge. The `directions' say it gets all those special places (if we all have them are they really so special?) but I think a washrag does a better job.

So why am I even thinking about this thing this much? I'm done and I'm outta here - to find my washcloth.",2
"UPDATE ON 8-28-17:  Since I first purchased this, I've been getting really bad skin rashes and welts on my face after using this.  I have sensitive skin, and know that this product is causing the reaction since it only happens when I use this.  While I like the other Mad Hippie products I've tried, I'd stay away from this one if you have skin that is easily irritated.  One or more of the ingredients is definitely too strong if you have bad reactions!
-------

I recently ordered the Mad Hippie Face Cream, Exfoliating Serum, and Antioxidant Facial Oil, and really like them a lot.  I've only been using them a few days, so I'll be sure to update my review as I use these more, but so far I like the fact that this is a healthier brand, with not many chemicals added to their products.

This Face Cream is not quite hydrating enough for me, but I've found that using the Antioxidant Facial Oil on top helps seal in moisture.

The Mad Hippie website also gives instructions for how to layer their products:

""We recommend gently massaging the vitamin C serum into your skin in the morning after washing and drying thoroughly.  Wait 5 minutes after applying the serum & apply the creams.  Apply the face cream to the entire face, including eye area, then apply the eye cream beside and below the eyesmaking sure to rub both creams in well, particularly around wrinkle prone areas.  Follow this with our extra hydrating antioxidant facial oil.

At night, follow the same steps but replace the vitamin C serum with an exfoliant:  either the exfoliating serum or vitamin A serum.  If just using the creams, wait a couple minutes after washing your face when skin is fully dry to apply. The facial SPF should be used as the final and last step of your morning routine.""",2
"I have been using this after meals since I have braces. It helps remove all the food that gets stuck around the brackets. Other than that, I don't think it is that great. The orthodontist said the priority should be flossing and brushing, not the Waterpik. He said the Waterpik does not have enough pressure to remove plaque. This is really just for getting the big chunks of food before I brush and floss with Oral-B Superfloss.
Before I got braces, I occasionally used the Waterpik but I can't say it did much for me.
It has been a year and I have noticed a puddle of water around the Waterpik after I turn it off. I think the handle is now leaking.
After my braces come off I will probably throw the Waterpik away.

UPDATE: I was right. The handle does in fact leak. I could buy a replacement handle for $10 but I don't want to. Overall, the Waterpik lasted about a year, which is not acceptable for a $50 item.",2
"At first taste, the Crest Pro-Health for old folks seems pretty good.  There's no alcohol and consequently there is none of the tingly sensation some of us are accustomed to.

After using it, your breath is definitely minty fresh... BUT there's a weird chemical after-taste that lasts and lasts; which my husband and myself found to be unpleasant.

On the non-pro-health side, it's a chemical concoction.  It contains ""propylparaben"" which is know to mimic estrogen.  It also contains Red 33, which can be found in Cutex Nail Polish remover.

Now really, given that we are adults-over-50, can't we just have clear mouth wash.  Or whatever color the Cetylpyridinium Chloride gives the liquid.  Because that's the only active ingredient: Cetylpyridinium Chloride.  (also used in some pesticides because it fights fungus.)

Can't recommend.
I really prefer a mouthwash that doesn't put my tastebuds out of action for hours at a time.  Also, my dentist insists that I use something with Floride to protect my tooth enamel, which this product doesn't have.",2
"Both times that I experimented with the product, I found the results unsatisfactory. It made my hair a bit smoother, but I couldn't achieve any real volume with it. The best I can say, is that it has a pleasant scent. (But those with fragrance sensitivities/allergies may find themselves bothered by it).

And, I must agree with several reviewers who sagely noted that the components of the product are less-than-healthy. The first two times I tried the whip, I quickly washed my hands afterward. Of course, logically, it was still in my hair ... and near/on my scalp. Ultimately, this made me way too nervous to continue to use it, so I tossed it.

There are number of better, more effective, less expensive products on the market. Although a little pricey,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alterna-Bamboo-Volume-48-Hour-Sustainable-Volume-Spray-4-2-oz/dp/B00CCYOHPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alterna Bamboo Volume 48 Hour Sustainable Volume Spray-4.2 oz.</a>&nbsp;is amazing!!! And completely natural! Give that one a try.",2
"These little strips are about 1 1/8 X 3/8. They are long enough to cover about 3 teeth. They are easy to apply and they adhere well. I noticed a lot of the reviewers complained that they don't stay in place. I did not have that problem. I think that if you apply the strip, close your mouth and don't talk, eat, or keep touching  the strip with your tongue, you will have a better chance of it staying put. You are supposed to leave them in place for 10 minutes and you cant eat for 30 minutes. I have had a problem with sensitivity to cold as I have gotten older. I think my receding gumline is the main problem. I was hoping these strips would work, but I cant say I noticed much difference after using them.",2
"I use essential oils frequently in atomizers, on damp cloths near fans, and even as an additive in homemade cleaners. What I've found is that lavender scents can be tricky. Some are intense and other times they can be rather weak or not even smell like lavender at all. The Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender Blossom Linen Water is one that sadly falls into the latter category. I sprayed it on decorative pillows and at first it smelled really good They got the scent correct. But when I picked up the pillow 15 minutes later, it was no longer detectable. I tried it again, this time sniffing it 5 minutes later. Sadly, only the faintest hint of lavender greeted my nostrils. I was disappointed as Im a fan of aromatherapy, but this product just does not pass the muster.

I poured some full strength into my diffuser and it did work then, but that means using a lot of the product. Id rather just add a few drops of essential oil to water. Additionally, Maison has some questionable preservatives (Methylisothiazolinone (MIT) and Methylchloroisothiazolinone (CMIT)) and FD&C Blue 1 and Red 33, rather than just pure scent. It does not come with a spray attachment.

"Luved it for the few months it worked!  great little bullet shaped ice cubes. It was a gift for my sister who never opened the box.  The next summer during a heat wave I asked for my unused gift back, ha!, and was in heaven for a few months.  the next summer after a few weeks the unit gave out.called new air and it was over the one year mark so no warranty.  so my advice is do not buy without  extended warranty!",2
i cook only once in a blue moon.  i was shocked to see with as little use as this range has had that the grates look like they were under heavy use for years!!!  i called Jenn air and spoke with Adam A.  and they wouldn't exchange them or fix them.  they only offered my 25% off ( which was the same price anyway from the internet).  i can't really compare much else on the range since i haven't used it much and i am  not much of a cook!  the stainless steel does tend to rust and stain.  i got a stainless steel fridge and dishwasher  at the same time  by other brands and those seem to not have the same stainless steel issues.,2
"I got a warehouse deal ""LIKE NEW"" and when I installed it, the coil got hot with the timer switch ""on"" but the dryer wasn't running. So in other words, I turned on the dryer to time dry 30 mins, but didn't start the tumbler yet. When I went back in the laundry room about 30 minutes later, it was incredibly hot in there, so I felt the dryer and it was very hot to the touch. I shut it off, unplugged and proceeded to see what the problem was. I changed the thermostat timer and still did the same. I found a youtube video where the guy says the heater element is grounded out and will stay on. Upon very close inspection to the element (after it cooled off), I notice one of the ceramic pieces that hold a coil was broken off and the coil was touching the casing. I flipped the coil back on the ceramic holder and plugged it back in. It worked! Well, I'm not taking any chances with this thing getting hot like it did the coil slips off the broken holder and grounds out again. This unit is going back, and I guess I know why it was in the ""used"" bin. I don't blame the manufacturer, it's just a broken unit that got re-sold. The next unit I will test BEFORE I install it. That would have saved me from a lot of trouble and potential damage from the heater coil being stuck on. Meanwhile, off to the laundrymat I go!",2
"This is my 6th pair and they are the best thing ever for my plantar fasciitis and resultant neuromas. Unfortunately, the ones I ordered from SmartDestination must be seconds as they kill my feet.

Can't return them because I wore them several times. These might be fine for someone with a narrow foot.",2

"Bottom-Line: I have come to the conclusion the ""Men's Health"" is not written for me.

The world of men's magazines is festooned with glossy covers adorned with half dressed woman and mostly vapid content geared toward the more Neanderthal and or juvenile among us.  In a world filled with Maxim and Stuff magazines, ""Men's Health"" magazine stands out as a periodical with some substance, style and intellect, but after reading the latest issue I am certainly not sold.  And what is with all of the lists?

I had been meaning to pick up an issue of ""Men's Health Magazine"" for quite some time when I picked up a copy--the October 2007 issue--while shopping for a computer manual at Borders.  The cover--as they always tend to do--featured a rather buff Jason Statham and article titles in big bold letters designed to catch the attention of that man looking for advise on Six-Pack ABS, or how to Dress for More Sex, or how to Eat Better and Think Smarter, or (my favorite) read what 1,293 Sexy Women Confess What They Want in Bed.

""Men's Health Magazine,"" whose tag line is Tons of Useful Stuff, was founded in 1987 and is published 10 times a year by the Rodale Inc.  The magazine began publishing in the United Kingdom in 1995.  Today ""Men's Health Magazine"" is published in 36 editions worldwide, distributed to 48 countries, and enjoyed a (2005) U.S. circulation of some 1.8 million.

The problem with ""Men's Health"" is that there is very little useful information to be found with the fold of the magazine despite it daunting size.  Most of the articles are snippets of information stuck between far too many glassy advertisements featuring young male models in clothing I would never wear and probably couldn't afford.  Same for the automobiles.  To be sure there was one rather lengthy article in the issue I read, but it was about dogs of all things!  The article I wanted to have some substance--a snippet on Michelle Ryan, the new Bionic Woman--was barely a page in length; how disappointing.

And yes there was a snippet or two about healthy food, but nothing I didn't already know.  And the lists, there are endless lists of thing we can do to improve this or that, mostly dealing with self-image and sex; there are very few actually devoted to well, men's health.  Has our attention span grown so short that we must now condense or leisure reading into bullet points; endless lists that tell us how to live our lives?

I have come to the conclusion the ""Men's Health"" is not written for me, a man in the middle of his life, settled, with a family, a regular job, with far too little time work workout, and far too little money to afford the rich life-style pimped by the magazine.  There is little practical information inside the glossy innards of ""Men's Health"" at least from my perspective.  Perhaps if I were young, rich, hip, the magazine would appeal to me, but I am none of those things, so...By the way what is the deal with all the lists?  Oh I already asked that question, I am still waiting for an answer.",2
"I started receiving Better Homes (BH) last year sometime as a free subscription.  I never signed up for it or sent anything in, it just started arriving on a free trial basis for about 6 months.  BH is not something I would normally think of subscribing too, but for free, I thought why not.  However it wasn't long before the magazine would arrive in the mail and it would either be flipped through for a couple of minutes and then trashed, or just trashed outright.  It truly was that uninteresting to me. I subscribe to about 4 other magazines and this is the only one I didn't think was worth it, even for free.  The magazine is thick and heavy, but its all Ads.  I mean this magazine starts out with 20 pages of Ads before you even get to the table of contents.  The other reviewer here that talked about it being aggravating the way you have to navigate through all the ADs, cards, and other offers to find the few articles that there are is absolutely right.  A 3 page article can be spread out over a dozen pages just because of the Ads.  The price of this magazine is certainly cheap enough.  On the surface it appears a downright bargain.  But the whole saying about getting what you pay for applies here for sure.  For some folks it may still be worth it of they happen to be the type that enjoy looking at and reading a bunch of glossy Ads.  If you're one of those types,BH is right up your alley.  For the rest of us that enjoy genuine articles and less fanfare, my suggestion is pass up Better Homes...",2
"The above is an actual question posed by the insightful author of a Bazaar article (August edition). For a moment it made me think Bazaar was on the cutting edge of animal psychology... Turns out, the question referred to the current equestrian trend in clothes and accessories... It gets worse: Bazaar ""buys of the month"" are a $750 pair of shoes, a $3,235 bag, and a $425 necklace...Yes, $4,000 is indeed my monthly accesories budget...(not!)

Over 50% of the magazine pages are advertisements. Bland ones... I buy fashion magazines for the pictures: I may not buy all the clothes, but at least I want to be informed what is current and can figure out how to emulate the looks. However, Bazaar seems to make ""impractical and over the top"" their mantra. Not to mention that UBER expensive is the only way they go...

The only reason why I am not angry is the extremely low price I paid for the year's subscription... I hope at some point I will see something in the 12 issues worthy of the subscription price...Hence the two stars...But... I will NOT be renewing my subscription. The magazine has gone down hill, compared to years of yore... Shame...",2
"Discover is a very successful magazine, and it acheived that success  with a formula that owes as much to the example of ""People"" magazine as it does to anything. It manages with cover all sorts of cutting edge stories without ever actually getting into the actual science involved. Instead, it concentrates on the people involved, the politics, the history... anything but the science.
Here's an example: A recent issue had an interesting piece on the physics of rocks skipping... expect it wasn't on the physics of rock skipping so much as it was on a particular fellow was was the world's champion rock skipper. Yes, there *was* a formula in a side bar that purported to describe the physics of a skipping rock, and some of the terms were even defined... but there was no explanation of the formula, or even any numbers. It was simple ""Here's a formula. It's very impressive looking, isn't it? Now on to other things."" And there was some history of how people looked at rock skipping, and even some allusions to how the physics of rock skipping had applications in understanding the physics of other phenomena. But what you couldn't find in the entire article was a single sentance that actually discussed the physics involved!
So what Discovery really is, is a magazine about science and scientists that doesn't actually have any science in it. And while there's a place for that sort of thing, if you're looking for actual discussions of science and technology that are still presented in a way that the educated non-scientist can understand, you'd be far better off with New Scientist or Science Week. And if a few equations wouldn't scare you off, American Scientist.",2
"The main target audience of Writer's Digest appears to be freelance writers.  Most of the authors are freelance magazine article writers who have finally `made it', and that is what they write about.  There are a few short articles about writing (usually written by the same people each month), but that is not the main focus of the magazine. A large portion of the articles are about technical topics related to publishing, and not writing.  This magazine is not for people who want to learn about writing; it's more for people who want to learn about how to sell their writing. The advertisements in the back of the magazine are so shady that Writer's Digest actually has to put a disclaimer on each page (think results are not typical in the lose 100 pounds in ten minutes infomercial), and I now get `if you can write a letter like this one, you could make a million dollars a year' junk mail as well.  The best part is the writing calendar with writing prompts for each day.  This is a great resource for writing exercises and generating story ideas.  However, it can be accessed for free from their website.",2
"Lucky is filled with spreads of different styles of clothes, accessories, make-up, and home decor. If you are looking for absolutely anything else, you won't find it here. I do find it odd that this magazine actually costs money because mostly it just advertises things and tell you where to buy them. Lucky comes with a sheet of tab stickers that say 'yes' and 'maybe' to mark things that you are interested in buying. I had fun pulling them off and sticking them on things I'd like to have just like when I was a kid and I went through the toy catalog circling all the stuff I wanted.
Some of the items featured in Lucky are reasonable priced, but most are not. Apparently Elton John has a line of candles that includes a `Three hundred dollar one that's the size of a small water buffalo.' (Insert one of my 'yes' tab stickers here!) The styles do seem to be up to date and trendy, but the same information can usually be found in any other women's magazine in their advertisements, and in other magazines you actually get content. Lucky really is just a trendy catalog.",2
"This magazine is stuffed with often decadent ads of expensive clothing, usually dull photos geared to readers in their sixties, and  parties featuring aging celebrities.  I usually flip through this magazine in a fairly short time.  However, every once in awhile there is a fascinating, heavily researched article.  The last I can remember is an indepth feature several years ago about the contemporary art scene before the financial bubble burst. Great stuff.  Otherwise, I can't see this magazine lasting another five years in print... Mostly flash, little substance.

Edit:  Add another excellent article:  April 2013 issue, A Tale of Two Londons, an expose of the City of London Corporation, a city within a city, where ""lax regulation and lax enforcement"" allow dirty money from, for example, Third World dictators, Russian oligarchs who fleeced Russia's resources, and  American bankster gamblers to escape taxes and laws from their home lands. Thank you for revealing what's going on, Nicholas Shaxson.

"Yes most issues are as thick as Vogue, which of course means like 50 pages of ads, before you get to the first page of text, but overall, I'm really impressed with their articles. They write about a variety of topics, and I thought it was great, how in the March (current) issue, the Editor In Chief, decided to use his column, to show the names of everyone who's died since the war in Iraq began, and where they were from, and what rank they were. It was really sad seeing these guys who were only 19, and they had their whole life ahead of them still. (Of course, these were all the people who had died as of press time for the issue). I believe the count was 472, and that has risen by almost 100, but it was still a very nice gesture. So what genre is Vanity Fair in exactly? Well, first off, don't let the name fool you and don't think just because when you first open it and you come to your first perfume sample, that it is only a magazine for women. Because further on in, they also have male models, so it's kind of for both genders. Some might say it's an Entertainment mag, but I hear it's just General Interest, and that's why it's not in the women's magazine section of my local grocery store, and it's just to the right of the Entertainment ones, so apparently, it's General Interest, and it means it's for anyone. You really shouldn't be ashamed to get it, like I first was. EDIT 3/13/04: After recieving the new issue today, I'm completely sure it more for women that anyone else.",2
"I'm past the age range that this magazine recommends (8-12), but I was at the bookstore one day browsing through magazines when I came across this one and started to read it, expecting a clean, wholesome, American-Girl type magazine with no advertisements.

Well, I was wrong. Discovery Girls is nothing special and has as many advertisements as the typical teenage magazine. Plus, the topics covered in it are nothing really special, the fashion pages are lackluster, and the advice columns and such, well, SUCK. Topics in it are also sometimes inappropriate for the 8-12 age range, as well (some issues have stuff about make up, dating, and boyfriends and girlfriends. At EIGHT years old?!?)

In addition to the high price, advertisements, and age-inappropriate articles, this magazine also is, well, boring. Nothing in it is really interesting and since it's so short, you'll probably read through it really fast (not counting ads).

Save your money. If you're 8-12 years old and want a good magazine, read American Girl. It's definitely better than this one.",2
"Kids like to read magazines and books as long as they contain visual elements, games, and other things to keep them entertained. They don't even mind a little bit of education and learning as long as it is entertaining in some way. This is why kids' magazines are often so visual and colorful and National Geographic kids is, as expected, a publication loaded with pictures and bright colors. The magazine is focused mainly on animals, but also includes material on science, geography, technology, etc.

My girls are big fans of several kids' magazines and they look forward to receiving issues in the mail each month. I like most of them, due to their educational value. But I must take exception to National Geographic Kids magazine. This publication does contain some educational material, but the problem is that the education is minimal, with the remaining pages covered with meaningless fluff and advertisements. The ads are especially annoying because National Geographic Kids intermingles the ads into what seems like an educational article. It is done in a subtle way that you may not even notice at first.

National Geographic Kids attempts to break up the educational material with trivia, some photographs, and a few other things, but they are not items I would expect to see in a publication that is supposed to be aimed at children in the later elementary school age years and that is supposed to educate. It is also surprising how thin the magazine is- it seems more like a thick newsletter than a magazine publication.

National Geographic itself is a great magazine and I am very surprised that such a quality publication would permit its name to be scarred by the likes of this magazine. It could be so much better with a little work. It isn't like National Geographic doesn't have the resources to make improvements. They have the expertise and the know- how to make a quality kids magazine, but seem content with this publication in its present form, in spite of its many flaws.

Kids magazines are plentiful and there are some really good publications available that help teach kids about different subjects in an entertaining way. National Geographic Kids, unfortunately, isn't one of them. The worthwhile material can be isolated to about one- third of the magazine's limited pages and the overall educational value is minimal. Sum everything together and you have a magazine that isn't worth the money and should be avoided.",2
"I've subscribed to ESPN and The Sporting News for a couple years now. When my subscriptions end, I won't be renewing ESPN.

I want detailed sports information, in-depth stories and the kind of details I can't find in my morning copy of USA Today. Instead, ESPN delivers a Maxim-esque version of sports with lots of popular culture reference and clip art. And plenty of ads for gold jewelry, cell phones and men's body spray.

I used to complain more but I've come to realize the magazine is a reflection of SportsCenter -- a show that has devolved into a series of annoying euphemisms for home runs, slam dunks and touchdowns.

Bottom line: If you love SportsCenter, you'll love ESPN magazine. If not, look at the newly-redesigned&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sporting-News/dp/B00007B1OF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sporting News</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sports-Illustrated/dp/B00005R8BG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sports Illustrated</a>.",2
"I like most scientific publications because it comes down to, or should come down to, objective reporting of facts. Unfortunately SA has gone and started to editorialize the information it reports. I'm amazed at the community of ""scientists""  who swear up and down the sky is falling,or at least that it has a hole in and we're all going to die because of it. Do these people take into consideration the absolute immensity of the earth and atmosphere? They can tell that us, unequivocally, that we are damaging the atmosphere and that apparently they know the correct climate conditions for earth in 2014. What a load of dreck! The earth is so massive that man amounts to a pimple on it. The atmosphere is so immense that earth is a speck of dust, they can't possibly know what the correct ratio of gasses and vapor is supposed to be, yet we are bombarded with junk science that says we are killing the planet and the atmosphere because we release gas and vapor. How about proof of concept? Hewal and stream, river or ocean. They can't but they want us to believe that they can heal the earth and atmosphere? If we can't find a pinging airliner in the Indian Ocean, how can we believe that these ""Chicken Little"" scientists and their gloom and doom forecasts? We can't control or influence the weather or the atmosphere around the globe, If everybody in China jumped up and down at the same time, could they influence the orbit of the earth? No! because it's so huge. it can't be done. Yet we hear daily that we have to sequester carbon and stop using petroleum and switch to solar, wind or unicorn power. Guess what happens to sequestered carbon in trees when the tree dies or is cut down. It gets released. Al Gore set  the alternative energy industry free with his forecast or ""Global Warming"".  We've spent billions of alternative energy (Solara) and objective people have figured out that we can't meet demands by converting to ""sustainable"" energy sources. We have been sold a bill of goods, pay no attention to the man or woman behind the curtain, The political theater of ""greenies"" are going to save the world using regulations and unfunded mandates. SA has drunk the Kool-Aid and are now mixing up and distributing batch after batch each month. Who believes that man can ""fix"" the weather or environment? Who believes that somebody can correctly predict the correct climate and weather conditions for earth in 2014?  Count me out, I'm subscribing to and actual objective journal that reports actual or real information not this unicorn riding, mantra chanting mass hallucination of a Big Bank Theory magazine.",2
"The multi-page special reports on various world regions or themes, as well as exposes of corruption, are the best features. The end of the year issue making predictions for the following year is very broad and interesting. The anonymously written articles are annoying. Why hide your opinions?
The magazine promotes lessening or eliminating corporate taxes and not raising tax rates on the rich, while promoting government-paid: training programs based on what local employers want, cash assistance for employees who move over two hours from a new job, intensive home visits with health and nutrition care for children younger than preschool, expanded preschool, and earned income credits contingent on work so as to discourage poor people from not having paid employment (instead of taking care of their own young children).  Who's supposed to pay for these programs?  The declining middle class?
Their promotion of unhealthy homosexual ""marriages"" and applause at the ""gentle"" decline of worldwide fertility rates from 6 children per woman in 1960 to about 2 children per woman indicates their population control agenda and distorted sexual viewpoint. Don't they understand that a population dominated by old people indicates a dying civilization?
I learn some facts and get some opinions here that I don't elsewhere, but their editorial slant is a self-serving promotion of the failed Washington consensus.",2
"The cover on my last issue featured Sofia Vergara in Agent Provocateur's black lingerie - and I still didn't bother to renew my subscription. It was too little, too late for a magazine that initially drew my interest as I smarter alternative to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maxim/dp/B002IYSZBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maxim</a>&nbsp;and a more coffee-table friendly alternative to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Playboy/dp/B001UJICAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Playboy</a>. Alas, after a one-year subscription, Esquire failed to capture me.

I purchased my Esquire subscription with the same expectations I had for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GQ/dp/B00005N7QI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GQ</a>, magazines known more for their abundant advertisements and cologne samples than for an unique, interesting take on men's interests. Esquire pushes well beyond my limits. The April 2012 edition (my last) makes a perfect example. The table of contents appears on page 25; advertisements packed between it and the cover:

Bvlgari
Giorgio Armani
Ermenegildo Zegna
Dolce & Gabbana
Calvin Klein
Woodford Reserve
Lincs DC & Co
Newport Beach Film Festival
Hugo Boss
Luminox
Moontower Comedy & Oddity Fest
Buick

That's 24 pages of advertisements before you reach the first editorial copy. And if you think that's an unfair representation, let me share that the next 20 pages includes ads for JC Penny, Tommy Hilfiger, Triumph, Canali, Salvatore Ferragamo, Ford, Breitling, Hickey Freeman, Gucci and Citibank. Within the next 20 pages, there are two more pages thinly spread with a table of contents, a staff listing, and only four pages of content, one of which carries the staff listing jump.

So, in the first 45 pages of Esquire, there are less than four pages of actual content.

Only one article, ""Miracle"" by Craig Davidson, was of the quality that I'd come to expect from Esquire. The nine-page piece (two pages serve as bloated title art) explores the medical advancements of synthetic hormones to delay age-related conditions.

The Sofia Vergara cover garners two thumbs up from me. However, only three more pictures of her appear in the magazine. Three! That's reason enough to fire an editor, maybe a couple. I can only take so many pictures of shaggy, bearded, brooding men hawking shoes, watches and cologne. If you are going to put Sofia Vergara on the cover, at least have the decency to treat your readers to a longer layout, at least a half dozen pages.

What's left is a choppy, increasingly juvenile collection of short articles and humor that illustrates how much Maxim and the other Laddies infected the entire men's magazine industry. The April 2012 edition included these one-page, puddle skippers:

Levi's made and crafted
Mad Men's fifth season
New books by Stephen King and John Grisham
How picky are sperm banks?
Keyboard shortcuts we need

In summary, Esquire is at the 1977 Elvis stage of life. I look back on the old issues with the same fondness I once held for Men's Health, Playboy and GQ. For a magazine approaching its 80th anniversary, Esquire needs some of those synthetic hormones to ward off its bloated visage and marked decline in quality features. Someone forgot being entertaining and smart are not mutually exclusive. Simply, today's Esquire is shallow and Maxim-esque.

Rating: Two stars.",2
"PLEASE NOTE -- I'm TYPING this paragraph, but the REST of the review was dictated (unedited for insertion here, except where noted therein) by using Dragon NaturallySpeaking 9 Preferred, using the minimum required training, even though the product is advertised as requiring NO training.  Use your imagination to figure out what I was really saying during that dictation!

The first thing I thought was important to note in this review was that there are a couple full Asia's comments that were used in the advertising for this product on Amazon.com.  First, the advertisement states that, ""no script reading required to get started"", and ""require no training,"" which are both statements that are utterly untrue.  As soon as installation is completed, you are asked to begin training for the new user -- just as in previous versions. I'm as shocked as such blatantly false statements could be made in the product's manufacturer or not get in trouble for making them.  When you began in and immediately insisted she go to the standard training, in fact I think it's the same training required in Virgin eight with the same selections.  In fact, I tried starting dictation without doing any training, and I was informed that the user files were not ready to allow this user to begin dictation yet; instead, I was required to get into the same training as was required in Virgin eight before I could do any dictation.  Thus, the reason for my giving this product such a low rating out of the box is because of the false advertising, backspace; if it gets better I mean in my original rating to reflect improvements in the product if they happen during further use in training.  ""Mean in my"" in that last sentence was actually ""I may emend"" (had to type those three words by hand).

As to whether this program's (that word originally came out as ""Koran's""!) dictation is 99% correct as adverse ties in the description, you can be the judge from this dictation's accuracy or inaccuracy.

Oh yes, I also had the same problem of us have had with insistence of either register and reregister and reregister the product.

It is very possible, and that it will improve with use.  However, I'm very frustrated that I opted to delete my previous user files from Virgin eight because I was told by the advertisement of a product that there was no dictation necessary which suggested that I did not need mild user files.  The word ""mild"" in the previous sentence actually was ""my old.""  So much for 99% accuracy.  So far, I can't really tell any difference in original accuracy over Virgin eight, other than the fact that the Dragon bar is graphics look a little different.  The tutorials are the saying with the exception of a small addition of conveying its(that was Advanced) tutorials covering a small amount of information.  The training looks the same date, the N. accuracy at star looks about the same, as Virgin eight.  I hope this will improve with training, but I have to say that I'm definitely not throw for false advertising regarding a lack of training needed to begin using this product.

Other than the addition of an extra installation disk or a DVD, I'm really beginning to wonder if there is any difference for improvement with Virgin nine over Virgin eight, other than the fact that I just blew another [...], after the rebate a having gotten yet, to ""upgrade.""  And, by the way, I truly do not speak ungrammatical he, which I'm guessing is the impression you getting from the gobbledygook you reading here.  Point being, what comes out of my mouth does not as necessarily equal what comes out on the page.  Again judge for yourself the insistence that there is no training needed you can start right away and then it is 99% accurate.  That is In Oh TE what I just said, and so much for the autopunctuation functions accuracy.  Good grief!  Even one I try to correct a nonsensical vacation, what comes out of my correction is anime remotely what appears on the screen to be oh so incredibly accurate Dragon NaturallySpeaking 9.  Oh yes brother, that's got to be in 99th percentile for sure exhalation mark.
---
Addendum (this is typed, not dictated) --
Another reviewer here, Chris B, is also absolutely right about the ""uninvited guest"" InstallShield Update Manager that surreptitiously gets installed with DNS9 Preferred. I didn't see it until after posting my initial review. This ""Service"" even becomes a permanent fixture in your CONTROL PANEL, and it apparently now ""manages"" my updates for Jasc and Corel products on my computer in addition to DNS9 Preferred. After finding that it does not work to fix the update error problem (see below), I've simply firewall-blocked its recurrent attempts to access the Internet for unknown/undisclosed reasons. Really annoying, and Chris B is also correct in that I also can not find ANYTHING about this unannounced, background add-on program in the Nuance DNS9 documentation.

Interestingly, in their ""knowledge base,"" there is the following disclaimer:  ""The InstallShield Update Manager is not included with any ScanSoft product, but is downloaded from the InstallShield website. To un-install the Update Manager utility, download the remover from Installshield's website.""  In other words, it doesn't come on the discs, but during installation, they download a third party's program off of the Internet and install it on your computer without your knowledge or permission.  Sound comforting?

Additionally, my installation of DNS9 can't recognize the fact that the program has been registered (successfully according to the online web page, but unsuccessfully according to the DNS9 on my computer!) THREE times now, so it refuses to check for updates, giving me the ""Error 13003: Version Not Registered with the Update Service"" message that another reviewer here has also posted about. So, the program won't check for updates. How can I fix that?

The grandiosely named ""InstallShield Update Manager"" does not function to fix this problem (even when I allow my firewall to let it connect to the Internet), so I dunno, but I can get one ""free"" help call with Nuance, but any further ones cost $19.99 per ""incident.""  Even worse, to email for support, you have to complete a ""Problem Report Form,"" which costs $9.95 per ""incident."" I've rarely seen a company charge for email tech support. So, to get this program installed properly, I'm supposed to pay THEM to help me debug THEIR product? Really revolting. Again, to borrow from Chris B's review, he's absolutely right about the lack of ""good ol' customer service with this mob.""

The dictation quality is improving slowly, though it's still nowhere near 99% accurate as advertised, and these other headaches, backdoor sneakery, and the CS money racket just to get the product functional make me want to deduct a star from my original review.  I won't do that, though, in hopes that this revision isn't ""inadvertently withheld in processing"" for a week by this site's management as the first version of my review for this product was.

My Hardware Info -- Dell Dimension XPS Gen 3, Intel Pentium 4 550 w/HyperThreading (HT) Technology (3.40GHz), 1.00GB RAM, Windows XP SP2, Creative SB Audigy 2 ZS (WDM), Telex H-531 DIGITAL USB Microphone

Accuracy is substantially better than the Telex, even with minimal training.  I can't add any stars to my review, though, because even though this microphone works better, DNS 9 Preferred says that the sound quality of the Telex was better than the Plantronics, even when the Plantronics is functioning better.  See my review on the Plantronics microphone for details.",2
"[These comments are based on my continuing nightmare of lousy experiences with Quicken Deluxe 2008. This software, which has been getting continually worse since 2002, couldn't have possibly improved since then ... ]

For me Quicken 2008 was a forced/hostage upgrade from Quicken 2005. You ""have"" to upgrade since they've cut a deal with the financial institutions to cut off your online access with the institutions if you don't upgrade every three years. Just as found when I was hostage upgraded in 2005 from 2002, there's nothing more than a cosmetic face-lift, no meaningful fixes/improvements -- but there's even more bugs, problems and aggravation.

* Product now will not connect properly to Fidelity; no problem under 2005.

* Took forever to figure out how to turn off a ""reminder"" function ... that kept reminding me to pay bills already scheduled to be paid using the auto-pay function. 2005 did the same thing and it's not been fixed.

*You can turn off the product registration nag screen ... if you Google to find out how. Product does not have to be registered to use it.

* Un-reconciles accounts six months back every once in a while. I've been assuming that's being caused by a few bytes of bad data that occasionally comes from the financial institutions ... that the Quicken people have not properly coded so as to filter out. This bug also surfaced in 2005. Two weeks into 2008, I've seen it again already.

* You can't turn off the ""free update/revision"" nag screen unless you take the update. No such nag screen in 2005.

* When connecting, the completion screen used to show which accounts had new transactions to match and had convenient buttons next to each to take you directly to the account. Gone in 2008. Now I have to look through every account each time to see where transactions might have been retrieved.

* Icons everywhere attempting to peddle other unwanted Quicken products. One of the 'product improvements' in 2008.

* Doesn't handle stock distributions correctly (since they were not actually paid for); keeps generating error messages when you enter the correct posting of no cost incurred. Same problem in 2005.

* Tricky screens/checkboxes/prompts that try to bait you into using/enrolling for QuickenDot services when you don't have to or need to. Users that did so now post complaints they can't undo it and that the QuickenDot server is constantly down, causing problems/delays when trying to connect to other accounts using a one-step update.

Yet another company that's grown totally complacent about product quality while wallowing in its assured-for-the-moment revenue stream. It will bite them hard in the long-run. Postings indicate similar complaining regarding the major competitor product, Microsoft Money. If history is any lesson, there's no reason to suspect that these software products will ever get better under these conditions. Some other product will have to steal their customer base before they wake up and smell the coffee.

If you are not already committed to either of those two products, take a good long look at open source software such as GNU Cash.

[Update: April 15, 2008] Does now connect to Fidelity ... occasionally. When I opened the portfolio area today, the entire computer screen flashed with confusion and the product crashed. 2005 never once crashed. Still flashing but no subsequent crashes. Who knows what happened. Not me. Apparently not Quicken programmers either.

[Update: July 12, 2008] Connects to Fidelity now more or less on regular basis. Software still flashes/flickers routinely. Also slow to load, apparently trying to read every single record into RAM, regardless of age. Pop-up screen this morning stating ""We've noticed you are not downloading your current Quicken Visa/MasterCard transactions, click here to ..."" I don't have one. Obviously a deceptive come-on intended to trick users into the application process for a Quicken credit card. Nice. Still constantly beg-screens me to take the latest software update.

[Update: October 18, 2008] Just downloaded this week's financial transactions and Quicken wiped out four months of reconciliation on one of my credit cards ... again.

[Update: January 10, 2009] Tried to change the amount of an annual repeating payment. Refused to accept the change with the error message ""You must make this change and sign on no later than six days before scheduled payment."" Payment was set for April 4, 2009, almost three months in the future. I had to delete the payment, log on to make the deletion take effect, then enter the payment all over again for the new amount, then log on again to make that payment take effect. And when I tried to log on I rec'd an error message stating an Internet connection was not detected (a message I get rather often despite my always-on broadband). Luckily I can choose the ""Ignore"" button and it will go ahead and connect. Quicken programming staff = worthless carpetbaggers.

[Update: March 5, 2009] Wanted to stop an ongoing monthly repeating payment where the next scheduled payment was already in place in my register for March 27. I edited in a change for ""how many times"" from ""unlimited"" to ""1."" In other words, I wanted to pay on March 27 for the last time. When I logged on to the bank the first time, Quicken canceled the March 27 payment.  Now doesn't that take the cake--Quicken accounting/finance software programmers are unable to count up to one. And, as all too often anymore, the screen went wacko while I was logging onto the bank.

[Update: March 8, 2009] Quicken just UNreconciled one of my credit cards (again) back to the October, 2008 close. Luckily, its a card I don't use much. I suppose this has something to do with Quicken software coders not understanding the start of Daylight Savings Time.

[Update: March 27, 2009] The repeating payment change I referred to at March 5, 2009? The saga continues. When I tried to enter the NEW repeating payment, it wouldn't take. I entered it, connected to the bank and nothing happened. The payment did not show in the list of repeating payments or in the register. I tried deleting the payee entirely to start over, but Quicken wouldn't/won't let me delete that payee at all. It claims it cannot be deleted because there is a repeating payment in effect ... that would be the payment that is ALREADY canceled. Which means I can't cancel it so I can't delete the payee. To set up the new payment I ended up having to create an entire new payee to make the new payment 'take.' I had to put a dash in the middle of the account number to create the new payee since Quicken won't allow two repeating payments with the exact same account number. And I am still stuck with the old payee on file which I cannot delete at all. I had to call the bank twice just to make sure the durn payment is actually going to be made on time ... and made only once ... and for the correct amount. You would think there would be a way to force deletion of a payee. Then again YOU are thinking, Quicken programmers on the other hand are off somewhere slurping down a latte.

[Update: April 2, 2009] Have an established monthly recurring payment of $[...] and would like to change it to $[...]. Enter the Online Center, click on Repeating. There it is. Click on it then select Edit. Change the amount from $[...] to $[...]. Save the change. Seems simple enough. Log on to the bank. Result: (1) Quicken cancels the next pending payment, on April 19, of $[...]. So far so good. (2) Quicken enters a pending payment into the checkbook register for $[...] dated May 19. Huh? What happened to my April payment? God only knows what will happen if I tinker with this recurring payment any further. I will write a paper check for one month ... and hope for the best. A[...]

[Update: July 14, 2009] Quicken is popping up a screen telling me I am overdue on a July 10 payment to a vendor for $[...]. The register shows the payment was made and cleared on July 10. And it's reminding me to schedule another future payment ... that's already scheduled. It's the same durn thing I was talking about in bullet # 2 at the top of the review, apparently it's a zombie bug that has now risen from the dead. Still begs me to take the Quicken software update constantly.

[Update: September 15, 2009] Quicken has suddenly started reminding me ... once again ... that certain bills are overdue, even though they've already been paid using the automatic monthly payment function. It asks me if I want to delete, pay or skip. I can only guess what havoc might occur if I delete or skip ... so I just keep waiting for the nag screen to eventually go away.

When Quicken goes under, I'm going to wear a pink tuxedo to the funeral.

NOTE: I have posted a copy of this review under ""Quicken 2010 Deluxe"" and I will add any further comments and updates to that post.]",2
"This review is of WordPerfect Office Standard X5 -- a suite of integrated products -- but the same comments apply to X4.  This review focuses on how WordPerfect's vaunted ability to convert other program files, is hot air.  Other reviewers have covered the pro's (and there are many) and cons (and there are many) of creating documents IN WordPerfect.  If you don't have much need for converting pdfs or other files into WordPerfect, then please skip my review.  If you seek a word processing program for complex documents you will create in that processor, then pick WordPerfect.  Simpler word processing needs are better served by Word.  So now, onto the hot air of WordPerfect's vaunted ability to convert pdf and other files (which is my main need for updated versions of the program).

Sidebar: I just bought X5 and will return it (more on that story at the end of this review).  I own X4.  This review is long, but it offers alternatives to the dysfunctionality in WP, since like many others I'm stuck with it.  Hope the ideas prove helpful.  Yell at me if they don't.

'Starting with the non-WordPerfect components:  forget Quattro Pro.  It can't retrieve wk1 files in either X5 or X4.  X5 doesn't even have that as an option, though X4 does, and when you try to retrieve ANY wk1 file in X4 or X5, you get an error message that there are invalid characters in the file name.. and then the program crashes.  My XP Pro (SP3+) altogether freezes for some minutes, despite 1GB RAM, Pent4 and 3.4GHz.  BUT if I first retrieve the wk1 in Excel 2002 and prior, no problem except to change the font from their stupid Courier default to Franklin Gothic Medium (etc), and save as xls.  Only THEN can X4 or X5 of QP, read the file.  So much for vaunted conversion back-capability.

Dysfunction City.  At least pre-2007 Excel can read wk1 files, which for millions of us are still the workhorses in our day.  My whole business is built around them for the last 30 years; I designed the templates myself.  Run in a DOS window, old Lotus 1-2-3 2.x is fast and sterling, full audit trail especially with Funk Software's Worksheet Utilities.  Wish IBM, who owns the rights to both programs, would resurrect them.  Fat chance.

So QP better not quit its day job.  Forget the other things in the WP suite, they don't work either.  Lightning sends XP Pro into a hang, can't read anything I tried to use it to read, and Mozilla is not compatible with it, so your browser crashes when trying to use it.  Forget Presentations, totally unintuitive and how do you get to the next page?  Forget Thunderbird, it won't store your passwords in a logical place, so what's the point of it being able to ask for email?  You have to BE THERE each time to type in the password, SINCE THERE IS NO PLACE WITHIN THUNDERBIRD TO STORE PASSWORDS.  Instead, it stores passwords in an insane 'profile' which has a name no one can remember.  Or, you have to sync to the internet, store that vital information in the cloud, where someone can hack. Not to mention, its huge screen real estate taken up with a blank border in Preview, and other unintuitive idiosyncracies which prove Outlook Express shouldn't be allowed to die.  Use full Outlook, if you're on Windows 7.

Software interfaces need to make sense right out of the box.  Forget the rest of the WP suite, then.  So now let's talk about WordPerfect X5's dysfunctionality.

I gave WP X5 two stars for only one reason:  one star for the fact you really can CREATE good documents in it;  second star is for its backwards-compatibility with old WP docs back to version 6 (and if you have 6, you can convert pre-6 to 6).  But with other old word processing software?  Well, not quite as advertised, because, just as is true for X4,

* I couldn't get it to work on Multimate Advantage docs, though it recognizes THE FIRST HALF of the fields (doesn't recognize the close of the field).  Older WP versions recognize the whole thing correctly, from versions 6 through 12.
* Same, for X5's inability to convert Word docs (more on that follows below); or,
* any of the other older word processors I've used over the decades.
*Can't read .tif.  That's an MS standard, Tagged Image Format, native to every Windows computer, scanner reader.  But to WP, it's not a 'valid format'.  I thought WP prided itself on integration with MS and especially, for scanning, in its hoopla praising X5?  Guess again.
* Like X4, X5 Can't read csv files.  Everyone else can.  So if you download your address book from Yahoo Mail to go into WP's address book, well -- it can't parse it, even though you set up the delimiter specs aptly.

* X4 and X5 can't properly convert a Word 97-2003 ONE PAGE document;  formatting squishes when Word spacing isn't single line (i.e., if you specified 1.5 line spacing or a large font).  This is very important, as many legal documents are created in Word, especially by the big law firms who do pension prototypes (like Relius, McKay-Hochman, Wolters-Kluwer).  Big market.  Don't use WordPerfect if you do this kind of thing.  Keep to Word, or you'll have mush for your client.

* Can't convert a three-page RTF created by a major national law firm which makes pension plan prototypes in RTF, either.  All squished, font comes in as Arial though it was made in a different font, all the formatting is wrong.

* Can't read mht file, nor html, though I pulled the html from online, and easily edited it in Word.  LOL, WPX5 just crashed as I was typing this review, trying to convert a second html file.

* It also crashes when trying to search your hard drive, UNLESS all the files in a folder are WP-originated files or pdfs.  X5 doesn't crash with a greater mixture of file types, but it does crash if the folders are large. X4 crashes nearly every time.
* WPX5, like X4, seamlessly converts older versions of Word Perfect (version 12 and prior, I have them all) -- but sucessfully converted no other format I tried in X4 or here in X5, except a blank page with only a faked letterhead.

* X5/4 are lousy with pdf file imports.  X5 is only marginally better.  With it, I tried converting Google-doc pdfs, no luck.  Messed up no matter what open/convert/import pdf option I picked (recognize, partly recognize, don't recognize text).  Same, for any of the pdfs you want to name from JStor or ccel.org.  When I tried to bring in the SCANNED Complete Works of Shakespeare (19th century book Google SCANNED in, freely downloadable from Google Books) -- WP claimed the file was encrypted or corrupted.  Funny, other pdf readers can read it just fine.

* This matters if your job depends on pdf manipulation.  I do a lot of tax filing work, so use a lot of Government pdfs (instructions, Government forms, etc).  WPX5 can't convert any of them, claims they are encrypted or corrupt -- yeah, right, the Instructions for your 1040 in pdf are corrupt or encrypted? -- or only converts if you choose DO NOT RECOGNIZE TEXT option.  For example, if you import the Downton Abbey schedule from PBS, what comes into WordPerfect is a complete blank, no matter what import/convert options you select.  A short Government form with DO NOT RECOGNIZE converts as readable, but is way off, so you may as well have imported it in Word.

* When I tried to bring in a large pdf I created WITH Word, WPX5 completely mangled the text no matter what choices I made for importing, and it couldn't read the links.  Complete disaster.

* Oh, and it crashes when you bring in government pdf files longer than two pages.  If only two pages, your scroll bars disappear until you go back to Settings and tell it to 'browse by' (how unintuitive) Top and Bottom or Top or Bottom.  Then suddenly the scroll bars appear.

* By contrast, I have no trouble at all converting from or to pdf files into/out from Word with Smart PDF Creator Pro, a $70 program I often use to convert pdfs to Word and back for the Department of Labor's EFAST2 program (filing pension plan information returns).  So if you want to convert a variety of docs or jpg, tif, spreadsheets to pdf, get that instead of WPX5.  Great for converting stuff to pdf for email attachments, too.  The advantage of converting government pdfs is that you can then edit each line item with short instructions to remind you what goes on the line, instead of keeping the ponderous instruction manuals on your desktop.  So think of the uses for other pdfs -- same idea.  True editing of a pdf, without spending lots of money for Adobe Acrobat (which is a pain to use, anyway.)

As for how WPX5 handles Word document conversion, the other thing X5 crows about in its ads, well -- it turned my 152-page Word document to mush.
* It did read many (not all) of the bookmark links intra-document,
* but it changed the faded highlights to bright colors,
* squished most of the headers,
* didn't align the borders properly, so that the text and lines were askew;
* couldn't read the koine Greek text though I have the koine Greek fonts installed,
* lost all the cell background colors in the many tables,
* can't display half of the page in landscape mode native to the Word doc,
* and of course repaginated the document, though in Settings I told it NEVER to repaginate or change the formatting of the opened document.

In short, the only non-WordPerfect (i.e., Word doc) conversion that WPX5 did properly in this testing of X5, was a simple mock Word.doc stationery page (no text, just the letterhead which is not in the header section).  All else I've tried, it mangled, or crashed trying.  Worthless.

WordPerfect's time-honored annoyances were preserved in X5;  like the fact

* you can't disable hyphenation across the board, but only per document;
* it forces repagination for your printer despite Convert settings which says DO NOT FORMAT.
* Then there's the perennial annoying WHITE SPACE of all those margins, wasting your desktop view, along with a bizillion buttons taking up three or four rows at the top (or sidebar) of the window. You can turn off the buttons, but then it's harder to edit.
* You can't turn off the dang margin whitespace, even in Draft Mode.
* And Reveal Codes? FORGET IT.  MS Word is bad because you can't see where formatting begins and ends, and Styles you pick are dysfunctional. A mistype or change in style suddenly resets the format in ways you didn't select, i.e., if you select a style with a font it changes the font size to something not in that style or in the former style.  WordPerfect's Reveal Codes would be an improvement over that, but the lower Reveal Codes' window has always been unnavigable.  You scroll forever.  So why don't they create object markers, instead? You know, like Comment triangles in Excel -- in the WYSIWYG window you can toggle on and off, or see the codes when you hover?  Alas, smart design is not part of Word Perfect's philosophy.  Instead, jargon and help chm's which only tell you what you already know, abound.  Typical of all word processors of Windows vintage.

* At least MS Word can do a merge, however stupid its system: it requires a special external spreadsheet with ONLY the merge data in it.  Carefully specify the field names to match the worksheet column names, no spaces, not too long, either.  And here's the trick: the spreadsheet you create, is a shell.  Its cells ADDRESS a spreadsheet UNDERNEATH the shell;  so that lower spreadsheet (say, your customer list or participant data), you can combine (copy into the lower worksheet) at will.  So you need never type data twice. WordPerfect claims it can do the same thing, but that's not really true.  I've been trying since 1985 to get it to work.

Prior versions of WP have these problems too; I've always hated working with WP for that reason.  Have kept it only because I have thousands of documents in prior versions of WP that I need to read on this computer. Old WordPerfect (version 12 and prior) works far better.

UPSHOT: if like me you have tons of important old Word Perfect files you must access in Windows 7 or XP, maybe get X5 -- but don't expect it to perform as promised on pdfs and pre-Word 2007 docs, mht, html, etc.

Whoever creates a truly intuitive word processor that can merge without a bizillion steps, will become rich overnight.  Multimate was the last good one (but doesn't have WYSIWYG); I still use it to generate my merge reports, as nothing better has come along.

PS:  I didn't buy this X5 from Amazon, but from Corel, because Corel badmouthed Amazon, blaming my X4's bugginess because I bought it at Amazon.  But the X4 disk SAYS OEM right on it, and is original, not a copy.  So now Corel can't blame Amazon, since this X5 review is of a onsite COREL-purchased copy.  Which, I will return in 24 hours.  PPS: it's now 12 hours later, and they have to issue me an RMA hopefully sometime tomorrow, before I can get refunded on a product I've not yet received.  The product will arive in snail mail in a week, which I will return unopened.  So it will take a month or two before I get the refund.

BUYER BEWARE:  do do do buy at Amazon.  They mean it when they say no hassle refunds;  I've never seen such a dedicated bunch of employees in my life.  Each one I've encountered in my many (too many) calls to them, takes the problem to heart.  As if an owner of the company.  So  I aim to shop here first, for everything I need; only if I can't find it here, will I shop anywhere else!",2
"I have the limited edition with exclusive bonus pack which provides ""over $250 in extra value"" of a 2FB USB flash drive, KPT collection plug in, Corel Painter Essentials 4, and Corel WinZip 14.5 Pro. Mine came with a short quick start guide (which was too bare bones to be helpful) and a small page size 137 page paper guidebook. The fact that Corel issues different packs, some with a user manual and some without is something that some customers are upset about.

I own and older edition of Photoshop Elements (a less expensive pared down version of the professional Photoshop) and am used to PS Elements. I will note that PaintShop Photo Pro X3 is the same pricing as PS Elements and from what I have been able to figure out, the two programs are very similar in content as well.

Before I tell why I am dissatisfied I'll share my opinion that if you already have a photo editing program, you probably should stick with that product and buy updates as you feel are necessary. There is a large and painful learning curve when moving from one software to another. I just learned this the hard way. The terms are different, the process is different, and it's just too painful to put oneself through unnecessarily. I am asking myself why I bothered to want to try PaintShop Photo Pro X3 when I was happy with (my no longer latest version of) Photoshop Elements. I guess I was thinking maybe this was better and why not get this and stop using PSE? I'm sorry I wasted my time. Before I say why I don't like this program I'll give more info.

I am looking for very basic photo editing tools. I take photos with a DSLR but am more into the actual taking of well composed and well lit photographs than I am into spending hours of my time editing shots.  What I want photo editing for are some simple things such as: cropping photos, resizing photo files to make them smaller when necessary (i.e. submitting photos to newspapers and websites), to remove red eye, to make a soft edge on a photo and perhaps to adjust an overexposed or underexposed photo.

Regarding projects, which this software does, I'm honestly not sure how I would use this. When making a photo book I would make it right on the site that professionally prints the book. When I make a photo Christmas card I make the soft edge on the photo right on the warehouse store website.  When I make a photo calendar I used the warehouse store's website to create it from home on the internet, and they print it and I pick it up at the store.

I have a six month old computer PC: Windows 7 Premium and an i3 processor. It is not yet clogged up with too many files and had plenty of room on it for new programs. Installation was easy and took me about 90 minutes only because I would walk away and realize there were many steps and it was waiting for me to keep clicking more boxes.  I was confused though, over having to install multiple programs all from the same CDROM, and was unclear what the differences were between: Paintshop Photo Pro X3, Project Creator, Painter Essentials 4 and KPT collection (that one I did not even bother installing). I did the registration online; there were no phone numbers for me to call. Some reviewers mentioned ads on the screen, I saw no ads. I have over 30,000 photo files on my hard drive at the time this was installed. I don't understand why other reviewers are saying it took hours to load this software given the number of images on their hard drive.

The instruction manual was promising offering 4 ways for new users to learn to use the system: the Corel guide, the Learning Center palette, the help system and web-based resources. Despite this seemingly wonderful array of options when it came down to figuring out how to do something as simple such as resize a photo to scale it down to 72 dpi I could not find the answer. I still can't figure out how to see if it saved the file as jpg or if it is saving it with some other format (i.e. raw, gif). I was annoyed that searches with common keywords such as `resize' turned up no results. I could not find any of this information in the user manual either.

When working to edit a photo I was annoyed that multiple images I was not using were lined up at the bottom which it randomly pulled off my hard drive, it was distracting. I am used to working with a program where the only thing on your work surface is what you have chosen to work on right now. I found that I could adjust the viewing box to get larger that pushed those off the screen.

The absolute worst thing about this program which is why I am uninstalling it and giving up is ---- the program over-wrote my existing program to view photo files that were already on my hard drive. When I try to open a photo by clicking on the file on my hard drive, it opens in the Corel Instant Viewer which is a piece of garbage that first pauses for 2 seconds doing nothing while it loads, then it shows an image for 2 seconds in a pixelated blurry mess before sharpening up to view it. Moving to the next photo using the arrow, such as to view photos you took on a certain day, takes 4 seconds to load each photo and my eyes go crazy with the sharp to blurry to sharp to blurry images. I cannot stand this Corel Instant Viewer.  It is impossible to quickly click through the photos. My old software from the Canon camera would instantly load with no pause and it would immediately be in perfect focus. This thing that Corel has is ridiculous.

After spending 4+ hours installing and trying to edit one photograph to just crop it to zoom in, reading the user manual and the online help, just trying to get one photo to convert to 72 dpi and jpg format, and not being able to figure it out, I give up on the program and am going back to Photoshop Elements. The simplest editing task should not be that difficult to figure out.

At at the very least a photo program on a brand new, high speed computer should not take 4 seconds to load one photo image and make us look at it for 2 seconds blurry first - there is no need for such madness.",2
"To start, it bears mentioning that I'm a previous Nuance (Dragon Naturally Speaking) customer, so I had no delusions about the company before selecting OmniPage 18. If you aren't a customer, then you should be aware that: 1) Their customer service is sketchy at best; 2) They'll nickel and dime you six ways from Sunday; and 3) If you give them your email address, they'll send you every Nuance-related marketing e-bumf from here to the end of time. With that said, after months of using OmniPage 18, here are my thoughts:

I have three operating systems across all of my computers: Windows XP, Vista, and 7, each with system requirements exceeding the minimum required for OmniPage. My goal was to try the software across each one, however, after dealing with the headache that was installation on the XP machine, I reconsidered. The autorun refused to automatically run, so I launched the set up file manually. After the software offered me a successful installation message, I launched it only to be greeted by a cryptic error message moments before the program crashed and closed. Rather than quit, I tried my hand at troubleshooting and discovered the problem--and it wasn't pretty. (At this point, I will note that Windows XP users should simply avoid this software, especially the technophobes.)

Once I had the software up and running, I gave the graphic user interface (GUI) a once over. It seemed rather simple and intuitive, but I quickly learned its appearance was deceptive if you intended to do more than a simple OCR conversion. (And by ""simple OCR conversion"" I mean clean black text on white background without images--usually of the kind originally created in word processing programs.) If you intend to use the extended features--for instance, a picture from your camera, or converting from a scanned book or a scanned document with an other-than-super-bright-white background--the trouble starts.

What's worse is that the help documentation goes so far as to be thoroughly unhelpful, possibly detrimental. One needs a healthy amount of patience, an inquisitive spirit without aversion to experimenting with software settings (which is why I told the technophobes to run away), and a pen and paper with which to create one's own help documentation as one discovers through trial and error how to complete certain tasks. (At this point, if this doesn't sound appealing to you and you need more than basic OCR conversions done on the default settings, then you'll want to rethink this software.)

The range of features this software touts is impressive and I wanted to test as many as I could before writing my review. I started with a PDF document that I originally typed in Microsoft Word. It was a plain document with plain Times New Roman text, no images, or tables--the fanciest it got was a header and a footer. OmniPage 18 converted this document into Word format beautifully, even with the header and footers intact and completely editable. Next was to try out a slightly more complicated PDF document conversion and I have to say, it passed, even where the tables were concerned. The only quibble was with the image positioning. At that point I thought maybe the software would be worth all the headaches to get it up and running. Then I moved on to converting *other* types of documents.

I printed a page on bright white copy paper from my first document and snapped a picture with my iPhone camera. I made sure the area was well-lit and the document was properly positioned in the iPhone screen. (Basically, I made sure I used optimal conditions, which is probably beyond what the average user might do, so bear that in mind.) The resultant document was vastly different from my first experience. About 30% of the converted text had errors and the corrections offered seemed completely random.

Next I worked on converting images I scanned directly from some books. OmniPage had a nice feature which allowed the automatic detection of the divider between two pages and that worked fairly well (that is, of course, if you can find it to use it). However, the book I scanned had slightly discolored pages and the margin of error for OmniPage went up considerably.

With the increased number of errors, the more interaction with the proofreading editor I had. That proofreading editor is not user-friendly or intuitive--at least not beyond the basic corrections. And finding a productive workflow is nearly impossible because many of the features that you'll need require multiple mouse clicks to access and then process. And Heaven forbid you actually make a mistake while doing the proofreading and need to go back because that will open up a whole new can of worms.

Even the files into which you can save your documents are unintuitive, because each one (even the same formats) vary slightly from one another, and there isn't any proper documentation as to the differences in each.

(By the way, the ebook format into which this program exports is completely horrid. Tip: export into HTML, clean it up in a different program, and then convert it using Calibre.)

However, the program does have a few redeeming qualities (hence the 2.5 stars instead of 1). It's clunky, sometimes unintuitive, borderline backwards, but once you get beyond this and find your groove, it has a few nifty features--the key is finding them.

So, to close...

For whom is this software? People who only need to do simple OCR conversions, or people who don't mind getting their hands messy when it comes to technical troubleshooting, people who have the patience of saints, and those who don't mind compiling their own documentation as they go along. Everyone else should probably look for something else.

I hope you found this review helpful and if you have any questions about the software or my experience with it, leave a comment and I'll do my best to answer.

ADDENDUM: When this review was written, the price of this software was significantly higher; while that didn't factor into my star rating, it was a poor cost for value. That said, if you can find this for under fifty, the cost for value greatly improves. (My original review still stands.)",2
"It's fast and lean. It's also pretty. Nevertheless, the engineers who wrote it are klutzes. The Windows 10 ""Start"" menu is more like the one in Windows 8.1 (awful) than in Windows XP (terrific). It certainly is no improvement over Windows 7, which was barely useable and very ugly.

I upgraded my slightly over one-year-old system to Windows 10 pro. Over half of my software did not make it into the Start menu in the process. The programs that did migrate from Windows 7 were not organized as in my Windows 7 setup, and did not include other programs and utilities contained in the same folders. Thus, when clicking ""all apps,"" I inevitably found many programs missing. Worse, the ""all apps"" section of the Start menu cannot be modified or edited -- except to uninstall programs which did make it to the list. You can remove items which made the list, but not add back the missing stuff (except by a torturous series of edits using ""regedit,"" which Microsoft has hidden to discourage use of this very dangerous utility).

Microsoft is obsessed with the ""tiles"" feature of the Startup menu. Yes, tiles are still with us. Ironically, unlike the ""all apps"" selection, this least liked feature of Windows 8 and 8.1 can be edited and modified in Windows 10, and programs missing from the ""all apps"" list can be migrated to tiles (the missing programs are somewhat buried in Windows 10, and sheer persistence is needed to reveal their location -- not in a place available for everyday use, but inserted so it seems as an afterthought to let you know they were not forgotten.). Dumb! Dumb! Dumb!

Edge (Microsoft's new Internet Explorer) is not even fully functional. It cannot accept add-ons, plug-ins or other essential accessories to make the browser useable. Microsoft promises this capacity will be forthcoming.

Still, only one of my programs available after the transfer did not survive the changeover from Win 7 to Win 10 -- Norton Internet Security (NIS). Almost immediately after booting up, I received notification that a new version of NIS was available and that it would be necessary to uninstall the old version before installing the new one. Even that venerable security standby did not do well in this new environment. The latest version was obviously rushed to completion by the folks at Symantec. I had considerable difficulty getting the program to register once installed. In fact, after many unsuccessful attempts to achieve this essential operation (otherwise the program ceases to function in 13 days ), I was compelled to seek the help of the good folks utilized by Symantec in India to exercise remote control of my computer to make the necessary adjustments to get NIS up, running and registered. Needless to say, allowing strangers to poke around inside my computer did not inspire much confidence in the security I was hoping to achieve.

I suppose I should be grateful that I was not one of those unfortunates who made the change to Vista or to Windows 8 (the latter was available as an option, but I elected to stick with Windows 7 on one system, and XP on two others). If Microsoft will fix the Start menu issues and render Edge fully functional, I believe that I will eventually adjust to this new operating system. And, quite possibly, even like it. I did so when moving from MS-Dos 2.11 to Windows 3.1, then to Windows 95 and onwards to Windows 98, and finally to XP. I never did care much for the change from XP to Win 7. But if nothing else, I do consider myself open to new and improved things...when they are proved better than what they replaced.

UPDATE: 8/20/15 - Installed Classic Shell Startup menu program. Solves ALL the Microsoft shortcomings with the startup menu. Installs easily. Allows for logical modification of the startup folders, simple additions to the ""programs"" listing, and even preserves the Windows 10 startup as an option (tiles and all).

UPDATE: 10/19/15 - The two most recent attempts to install Windows updates KB3093266 and KB3097617 have failed. The latter was supposed to fix the issue in the former. I made 10 unsuccessful attempts to install the most recent update between 10/13/15 and 10/19/15. Windows 10's control panel includes a utility to check and repair installation problems. It failed to do so. A telephone call to Microsoft support ended with a disconnect while waiting for a transfer to a techie who could assist me. An attempt to reconnect with support ended after numerous outgoing recorded messages, including a final one stating that support was overloaded and help could be expected in approximately 30 minutes. It is obvious to me (and others) that Windows 10 was not ready for general release, and unfortunates like me who ""upgraded"" to this latest Microsoft operating system fiasco can expect an indefinite period of frustration and futility while MS gets its act together.  I have downgraded this product rating from 3 stars to 2, and will lower it again if this situation does not improve.

UPDATE:  11/16/15 - The so-called ""Threshold Update""which Microsoft rolled out Nov. 10-12 (a massive update supposedly equivalent to a ""service Pack,"" or complete substitution for the existing Windows 10 installed free in July) did NOT make it to my computer automatically as promised. I was not alone in this experience. However, I was able to find the solution with the help of Google. The solution was to download the update/upgrade at Microsoft's website and manually install it. It took about 2.5 hours to download and install the entire package. Aside from some minor work needed to fix the Start Menu after the latest version was installed, everything else seems okay. Things appear to work faster, and I am thus far optimistic the switch from Win 7 to Win 10 may eventually prove acceptable. BUT, I still advise friends to wait a bit longer before leaving Win 7 or Win 8 for the new OS.

UPDATE:  8/3/16 - The so-called ""anniversary update"" available 8/1/16 (and gradually making its way to users with Win 10 already installed) is (IMHO) a dreadful disaster. The Start menu has not been fixed -- it is still a disorganized mess. Attempting to organize it so that it is usable is nigh impossible. Even removing items from the Menu is difficult (and nowhere explained). For the past 11 months I installed and utilized ""Classic Shell,"" a godsend alternative to the truly miserable Start Menu.  With the anniversary upgrade this week, the folks at Microsoft to my dismay have rendered the Classic Shell incompatible. Thus, those who preferred the Win 7 (XP similar) styled start menu are stuck with the latest abomination.

The folks at Microsoft now insist that Windows Defender be used instead of anti-malware/anti-virus software preferred by the user  (in my case, Symantec's well-tested and highly regarded programs). I have been unable to get Win 10 to allow me to select the latter in place of Defender -- and error notifications persist if I try; mainly to the effect that I have no firewall. This, despite that I have updated Symantec -- which Win 10 seems to accept as compatible, but which nevertheless does not allow to be selected as the default security program.  And the ""no firewall"" doomsday message continues to appear.

Since installing Windows 10 last August, I have managed grudgingly to learn to live with the new Windows Explorer file system (This PC), to somehow find my way through the cluttered and sometimes vague Settings menu, to locate and adjust to the new Control Panel buried two levels down in the Start Menu Folders, and even to the thoroughly counterintuitive interface which now dominates Microsofts latest operating system concoction. But I sorely miss XP (which I continue to use on two computers).",2
"July 2016
I am so frustrated with this software. All I wanted to do was pull in three or four stills along with three short videos. Total run time about 2 minutes. Adding captions was limited as far as I can tell; I was not able to do what I wanted to do. Then when I tried to export a .mp4 file Pinnacle Studio 18 failed to export the video portions. I've now spent about three hours on this little project and have not been able to spit out my little project.

There's no way I'd buy this software and don't recommend it.

February 9, 2016
I take it all back. Dropping back to 3 stars.  While Pinnacle Studio 18 has basic video editing capabilities the user interface sure needs some improvement. On top of that the Help PDF file could be better as well. I had to refer to customer youtube videos to get a few basic things done recently.

The user interface for importing video files is cumbersome. Managing those video files within the tool is much too complex for a basic tool like this.

At one point I wanted to separate a sound track from a video file. At first I couldn't figure out how to do that so I went to the help file but found nothing. Then I went to the user forum where there was even confusion whether Studio 18 could even do that basic task. In the end I found it to be quite easy to do, albeit a little hidden. This is an example about how the user interface and help file could be greatly improved.

I was easily able to add a title to a video. When it came to adding a caption to overlay part of a video I searched and searched. Finally a user youtube video helped. The solution was to click on a video segment and use the Title key again. How is a user supposed to figure that out? Title is title and Caption is caption. How easy it would have been to simply add a Caption button and make the editing behavior be easier to use.

So, as I have no better tool, I'll continue to use Studio 18, but there's no way I'd buy an upgrade version of this product.

January 28, 2014
Well I'm bumping my review up from 3 stars to 4. My son and I both purchased GoPro cameras and I've just finished editing two hours of captured motorcycle dirt ride video down to 13 minutes. I included fade-in and fade-out sound, titles, and captions that overlay the video. I'm beginning to understand the capabilities of the tool.

I do find the user manual a bit lacking, but goggling user help turns up text or youtube help that solves the issue.

There are definite speed improvements using Studio 18 over Microsoft Movie Maker.

Dec 17, 2014
I am dropping from 4 stars to 3 stars based on the fact that I can not get Pinnacle Studio 18 to export a decent video with the particular input file I'm using. This is the main thing a video editor needs to do so if it fails that it is pretty much useless. I give it two stars based on the features it has, and the fact that my problem seems to be just that - my problem.

I could find little evidence that Exported video quality is a widespread issue with Studio 18. There were very few complaints about video quality. My problem has to do with the input file I was working with. It is a file downloaded from the internet. Nonetheless that is the file I wanted to edit and it didn't come out well. At the same time Microsoft Movie Maker did a fine job on it.

It works well with better input files. I tried one from my DSLR camera and the final file from Pinnacle Studio 18 and Microsoft Movie Maker came out nearly as good as the input file.

I did try to contact Pinnacle but they want to be paid for support which I consider poor customer support. I did interact with the user forum where I picked up some hints on how to improve output quality but nothing worked.

I can use the program but it looks like it is going to be hit or miss depending on the quality of the input file. To save myself the trouble I'll just continue using Movie Maker most of the time unless I feel I want to use a more advanced editor at which time I'll try Studio 18.

At this point I wouldn't spend money on this product and wouldn't recommend it.

Dec 16, 2014
Trouble. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong but the video quality rendered in MP4/1080 is poor. I've tried to search the internet for help but didn't find any. If I create a video for Facebook no problem. But I have some videos that I wanted to trim some bad parts then render for watching on our large flat screen display. But even on my 24"" 1920 x 1080 computer monitor the output of Pinnacle Studio 18 is a disappointment.

I took a single file, cut out all but the first 5 minutes, then Exported an MP4/1080 video from Pinnacle Studio 18. The results were much less than satisfactory.

I then took the same file, again cut out all but the first 5 minutes, then Saved the move for High Definition Display using Microsoft Movie Maker. The results were quite good.

I will attempt to contact Pinnacle to see if there is anything I can do. I have a hard time believing the rendered output file can't be improved. A video editor tool that outputs bad quality video files is useless. But I've tried a number of attempts to obtain better image quality without success. Even if Pinnacle provides a solution it shouldn't be this hard.

Dec 10, 2014 Update
Today I captured a video of my 4-year-old receiving his yellow belt in Kempo Karate. Using Pinnacle Studio 18 I cliped out a part that was too long, then added a transition to make that cut out section flow nicely in the video. Then I added a title and a closing graphic transition.

Pros:
- Easy to install
- Easy to use the basic video editing features (without reading the manual if you can poke around a bit)
- The user manual is pretty good.
- The on-line video tutorials are quite informative.
- Pinnacle Studio 18 comes with a large number (1,500) of transitions.
- Comes with over 500 sounds (animals, bells, cartoons, etc.)
- Comes with 45 music clips
- Comes with over 550 Title video segments
- You can import photos and do some basic editing of them.
- It is easy to see that this program offers many features including multiple video tracks and audio tracks.

Cons:
- I had a difficult time altering the default execution time for a transition. Perhaps I need to read up on this.
- I was hoping I could ""crop"" or ""zoom"" a video. That doesn't seem to be available. On the other hand I don't know if any video editors allow that feature. Perhaps it is too much to expect.

Dec 9, 2014 Update
While watching some vacation video I found one that I had captured hand held with a long zoom lens and the video was shaky. I wondered if Pinnacle Studio 18 could stabilize it and sure enough that feature exists. I loaded the video file, ran the Stabilize Render and Play process and Poof the video was now much more watchable. Nice feature. Once again it consumed about 80% of my 64-bit quad-core 2.4GHz processor.

Dec 7, 2014 First Impressions. I've only had Pinnacle Studio 18 for a couple of days and just started using it today. I am a relative novice with video tools but I have quite a lot of computer experience.

I received Pinnacle Studio 18 free as a member of the Amazon Vine program.

I have used powerful video editing tools in the past, but my recent reference is Windows Movie Maker in Windows 7. For my needs Windows Movie Maker has been sufficient, although there were things I wished I could do to my videos which Windows Movie Maker did not support, such as zooming.

After I loaded Pinnacle Studio 18 it immediately offered to load a patch update which I accepted. The update worked flawlessly.

I have a great deal of computer experience, including being a graphical user interface programmer for 10 years. I believe I should be able to start a new software tool and use the basic features without first reading a user manual, or else the program does not have a good user interface. On the other hand every piece of software is unique so there is a start-up learning curve. Accessing the more advanced features usually requires reading the manual or watching tutorials.

I jumped right into a project involving four video files spanning about 15 minutes. I wanted to view the video content, and clip out any sections I didn't want to be part of the final video. Within 15 minutes I was able to discern the basics; loading my video files into the tool, putting the four videos in the order I wanted, assigning the videos to the timeline, and I learned how to cut out unwanted clips. It took me about an hour to work over my video, and begin the process of saving the final MPEG-4 500 megabyte file. So the tool passed my basic requirements.

After going through this early basic learning curve I find Pinnacle Studio 18 is easier to use than Windows Movie Maker. I am very likely to use Pinnacle Studio 18 for my video projects going forward.

Pinnacle offers on-line video tutorials as well as a text based user manual. I watched a bit of one of the youtube.com videos which I thought was quite good. I will likely take advantage of those tutorials for some of the advanced features.

This tool works my computer quite hard. I have a quad 2.4GHz processor with 8GB of RAM so it is reasonably powerful. I also tend to have several things running on my computer. I did encounter slow operation of all of my computer tasks while Pinnacle Studio 18 was rendering and saving my video file. As soon as the file was saved, which was much faster than Windows Movie Maker would have taken, my computer was freed up and working normally.

The resulting video file was smooth and the transitions were clean.

I'm not done and intend to re-edit my video, adding fancy transitions. I may try some voice-overs too. I will return here to add more comments. I realize this review is currently lacking in useful detail.",2
"It's fast, lean and the engineers who wrote it are klutzes. It's also pretty.

Now for the not so wonderful stuff. The Windows 10 ""Start"" menu is more like the one in Windows 8.1 (awful) than in Windows XP (terrific). It certainly is no improvement over Windows 7, which was barely useable and very ugly.

I upgraded my slightly over one-year-old system to Windows 10 pro. Over half of my software did not make it into the Start menu in the process. The programs that did migrate from Windows 7 were not organized as in my Windows 7 setup, and did not include other programs and utilities contained in the same folders. Thus, when clicking ""all apps,"" I inevitably found many programs missing. Worse, the ""all apps"" section of the Start menu cannot be modified or edited -- except to uninstall programs which did make it to the list. You can remove, but not add back the missing stuff.

Microsoft is obsessed with the ""tiles"" feature of the Startup menu. Yes, tiles are still with us. Ironically, unlike the ""all apps"" selection, this least liked feature of Windows 8 and 8.1 can be edited and modified in Windows 10, and programs missing from the ""all apps"" list can be migrated to tiles (the missing programs are somewhat buried in Windows 10, and sheer persistence is needed to reveal their location -- not in a place available for everyday use, but inserted so it seems as an afterthought to let you know they were not forgotten.).  Dumb! Dumb! Dumb!

Edge (Microsoft's new Internet Explorer) is not even fully functional. It cannot accept add-ons, plug-ins or other essential accessories to make the browser useable. Microsoft promises this capacity will be forthcoming.

Still, only one of my programs that is available after the transfer did not survive the changeover from Win 7 to Win 10 -- Norton Internet Security (NIS). Almost immediately after booting up, I received notification that a new version of NIS was available and that it would be necessary to uninstall the old version before installing the new one. Even that venerable security standby did not do well in this new environment. The latest version was obviously rushed to completion by the folks at Symantec. I had considerable difficulty getting the program to register once installed. In fact, after many unsuccessful attempts to achieve this essential operation (otherwise the program ceases to function in 13 days ), I was compelled to seek the help of the good folks utilized by Symantec in India to exercise remote control of my computer to make the necessary adjustments to get NIS up, running and registered.  Needless to say, allowing strangers to poke around inside my computer did not inspire much confidence in the security I was hoping to achieve.

I suppose I should be grateful that I was not one of those unfortunates who made the change to Vista or to Windows 8 (the latter was available as an option, but I elected to stick with Windows 7 on one system, and XP on two others).  If Microsoft will fix the Start menu issues and render Edge fully functional, I believe that I will eventually adjust to this new operating system. And, quite possibly, even like it. I did so when moving from MS-Dos 2.11 to Windows 3.1, then to Windows 95 and onwards to Windows 98, and finally to XP. I never did care much for the change from XP to Win 7. But if nothing else, I do consider myself open to new and improved things...when they are proved better than what they replaced.

UPDATE: 8/20/15 - Installed Classic Shell Startup menu program. Solves ALL the Microsoft shortcomings with the startup menu. Installs easily. Allows for logical modification of the startup folders, simple additions to the ""programs"" listing, and even preserves the Windows 10 startup as an option (tiles and all).

UPDATE: 10/19/15 - The two most recent attempts to install Windows updates KB3093266 and KB3097617 have failed. The latter was supposed to fix the issue in the former. I made 10 unsuccessful attempts to install the most recent update between 10/13/15 and 10/19/15. Windows 10's control panel includes a utility to check and repair installation problems. It failed to do so. A telephone call to Microsoft support ended with a disconnect while waiting for a transfer to a techie who could assist me. An attempt to reconnect with support ended after numerous outgoing recorded messages, including a final one stating that support was overloaded and help could be expected in approximately 30 minutes. It is obvious to me (and others) that Windows 10 was not ready for general release, and unfortunates like me who ""upgraded"" to this latest Microsoft operating system fiasco can expect an indefinite period of frustration and futility while MS gets its act together.  I have downgraded this product rating from 3 stars to 2, and will lower it again if this situation does not improve.

UPDATE:  11/16/15 - The so-called ""Threshold Update""which Microsoft rolled out Nov. 10-12 (a massive update supposedly equivalent to a ""service Pack,"" or complete substitution for the existing Windows 10 installed free in July) did NOT make it to my computer automatically as promised. I was not alone in this experience. However, I was able to find the solution with the help of Google. The solution was to download the update/upgrade at Microsoft's website and manually install it. It took about 2.5 hours to download and install the entire package. Aside from some minor work needed to fix the Start Menu after the latest version was installed, everything else seems okay. Things appear to work faster, and I am thus far optimistic the switch from Win 7 to Win 10 may eventually prove acceptable. BUT, I still advise friends to wait a bit longer before leaving Win 7 or Win 8 for the new OS.

UPDATE:  8/3/16 - The so-called ""anniversary update"" available 8/1/16 (and gradually making its way to users with Win 10 already installed) is (IMHO) a dreadful disaster. The Start menu has not been fixed -- it is still a disorganized mess. Attempting to organize it so that it is usable is nigh impossible. Even removing items from the Menu is difficult (and nowhere explained). As installed, it is not possible to add or modify the applications (left) side of the Start menu. Thus, customizing it is out of the question. For the past 11 months I installed and utilized ""Classic Shell,"" a godsend alternative to the truly miserable Start Menu.  With the anniversary upgrade this week, the folks at Microsoft to my dismay rendered the Classic Shell incompatible and removed it. Fortunately, the latest version of Classic Shell can be installed and will work with the Win 10 Anniversary update. Those who prefer the Win 7 (XP similar) styled start menu are not stuck with the latest Win 10 abomination.

The folks at Microsoft now insist that Windows Defender be used instead of at least one anti-malware/anti-virus software preferred by users (in my case, Symantec's well-tested and highly regarded security suites). I have been unable to get Win 10 to allow me to select the latter in place of Defender -- and error notifications persist if I try; mainly to the effect that I have no firewall. This, despite that I have updated Symantec -- which Win 10 seems to accept as compatible, but which nevertheless is not allowed to be selected as the default security program.  And the ""no firewall"" doomsday message continues to appear when it is installed. THEN, after installing the latest Norton update, which worked for one day and disappeared the next, I had to manually install and utilize the latest Norton Removal Tool when all other efforts to restore or repair the preferred Symantec security suite failed. Yesterday's installation had even disappeared from the Win 10 uninstallation menu (and not even Revo Uninstaller could locate it).

Since installing Windows 10 last August, I have managed -- grudgingly -- to learn to live (sort of) with the new Windows Explorer file system (This PC).  I am even somehow, and with difficulty, able to find my way through the vague and cluttered Settings menu. Given time, I have even found and adjusted to the new Control Panel buried two levels down in the Start Menu Folders, and even to the thoroughly counterintuitive interface which now dominates Microsofts latest operating system concoction. But I sorely miss XP (which I continue to use on two computers).",2
"I thought this rinse might be a more palatable alternative to Listerine Total Care.  But with average performance and a questionable active ingredient, it is unlikely that I will use this again.

The rinse comes in an easy to used bottle with a pleasing contour. I did not particuarly care for the wintergreen flavor, it was rather sweet, mint-like and artificial. But my major concern come from the potential side effects for the active ingredient, cetylpridinium chloride. While it has antiseptic, anesthetic and disinfectant properties it is used in bug poisons as well as dental preparations. While its use has been FDA approved, I think there are more natural, less toxic and equally effective ingredients available. Moreover this ingredient has been known to cause browning of the teeth as well as intefering with the sense of taste. The bottle label warns of the discoloration risk but claims that the staining is neither permanent nor harmful. It claims such stains may be removed by brushing or ""at your next dental visit"". If my teeth suddenly browned, I don't think I would want to wait for my next regularly scheduled dental visit. Dental visits don't rate high on my fun things to do list and I would rather not spend my discretionary income on removing tooth discoloration caused by a mouth wash.

So while the performance of this rinse was adequate, I will pass until they change the formulation.",3
"Aside from a couple years in college I haven't used an electric razor until I got this one.  After using the razor for three weeks to get used to it, it is still a bit of a let down.  It does very well cutting the hair along the cheeks but doesn't to very well along the chin and neck and found myself going over these areas over and over again to get the desired shave even breaking out my conventional razor occationaly to get a few pesky hairs that just wouldn't cut.

There are plenty of pros about this razor.  The trimmer does a decent job evening out the sideburns.  The razor tells you how much time the battery has left so you should never run out of juice in the middle of shave and it is easy to charge either on the stand or in the carring case the razor comes with.  The razor is really easy to clean.  And there is little to no irritation after the shave aside from a couple minutes of numbness right after the shave, but it's nothing a splash of water won't cure.

But if you want a close shave, a conventional razor is better but when I don't have time to break out the shaving cream, this razor will definately be suffciant.",3
"Let's think about this product for a minute.  You have a toothbrush which supposedly uses sonic waves to clean the teeth.  (I have to believe ""truth in advertising"" laws are at work here, because my Sonicare doesn't produce results that are any better than any battery-operated toothbrush I've used.)  Then you get this item which is designed to sanitize said toothbrush.

How can you really tell if this thing ""sanitizes"" your toothbrush head?  Even if you tried to fake it by putting, say, spaghetti sauce on the toothbrush and then sanitizing it, that still doesn't prove anything.  It hums and then you take your brush head out.  But what are the benefits of sanitizing the brush head?  Again, I notice no difference in my mouth from how things were before I had this, compared to after using this.  So, it does nothing obvious, but if you're paranoid, you might want to get it just to believe you're chasing down every tiny bacterium.",3
"This was OK but nothing amazing. I did like the smell (fruity) and I appreciate that it doesn't seem to have any artificial dyes since my skin is sometimes sensitive. Please note that while this does contain some plant oils and extracts, it also contains artificial fragrance.

When distributed from the container, it has an airy texture. However, it doesn't foam terribly well, so when you spread it out over the area to be shaved (I used it on my lower legs), it can be hard to see. (I could feel it, though, if I ran my finger over my legs.)

I do think this helped in terms of providing a close, fairly smooth shave. My legs were soft afterwards, though I did also use a body lotion.

Here are the ingredients since I didn't see them on the product page:

Water, Stearic Acid, Myristic Acid, Squalane, Glycerin, Potassium Hydroxide, Organic Coconut Oil, Glycol Distearate, Fragrance, Organic Jojoba Seed Oil, Organic Pomegranate Oil, Organic Green Tea Leaf Extract, Organic Shea Butter Fruit, Phenoxyethanol, Tetrahydroxypropyl Ethylenediamine, Ethylhexyl (Octyl) Palmitate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopherol, Limonene.",3
"I usually only use liquid body soap, partly because it's a pain when I drop bar soaps, and unless I have a washcloth the lather isn't as nice. When I saw this exfoliator that firmly holds the soap in place (with Velcro no less), I decided to give it a try.

The holder is a good size and even fits a thick bar of soap. The Velcro closure works very well to firmly keep the soap inside the sleeve. The soft washing side provides a nice bubbly lather. The exfoliating side, however, if pretty rough, even using a soft touch. I really can't use it as it hurts to the point of leaving scratches on my skin. But the most concerning part about this soap envelope, however, is that it doesn't dry between showers, and that doesn't seem sanitary.  On the one hand, it can be washed, but on the other I hate to think of the bacteria forming due to moisture between washes. Even 24 hours after my last shower, it's still wet (not merely damp). All in all, this is handy for those who prefer bar soap, but it's not good enough to make me switch full time from liquid body wash.",3
"When I was a child our family bought the first WaterPik that came onto the market. The whole family used it for many years. The area where the water came out was small and the spray could be directed easily. It did not make a mess. It was fantastic for cleaning my teeth, which had braces.

Now that my son has some orthodontia, the dentist suggested using a WaterPik.

This thing is unbelievable. The spray comes out so fast and the spray is so wide, that it makes a huge mess. Even I, a coordinated adult, have a hard time using this without spraying down the bathroom walls, mirror, and countertop. This is a mess. I am worried the wallpaper will be ruined and will begin peeling off.

Tip: Put the device in the mouth, then turn it on. Try to use it with your mouth closed or nearly closed and shut it off before you remove it from your mouth.

After reading other customer reviews, to prevent possible leakage, we take the unit apart and dump out the water after each usage.

Do your research regarding other models available as well as this one. The customer reviews here on Amazon are eye-opening.

I wish they made the WaterPik like the original ones that lasted for many years and were easier to manage.

Update: One child has been using this for 16 months and it is still functional.

Note on my star rating: For effectiveness for the job I'd rate it 5 = I Love It but for the mess I rate it a 1 = I Hate It which averages out to 3 star rating = It's okay.",3
"I tried both the one liter and 500 millileter bottles of this product. They are the same but for the size. Both reviews are the same.

I have tried a few of the Crest Pro Health products. This version is alcohol free and is geared toward people 50 and older but has the same active ingredient as the Pro Health Invigorating Clean Invigorating Mint  alcohol based mouth rinse. It does not have fluoride.

I wish Crest would better explain how this is different from the products geared toward people under fifty.  For instance people of any age can have plaque, bad breath and inflamed gums. I think most of the Crest mouth rinses work against these issues so what makes this special for people over 50.

I did find this sentence on the back label of the bottle. ""This rinse was selected for people over 50 because it is alcohol-free and provides a unique sensation.""  I am not sure what ""a unique sensation"" has to do with being over fifty.  If that is the only reason it seems like other Crest Pro Health alcohol free products would work the same.

I like the taste of this product. It does not have the bitter alcohol flavor that  many alcohol flavored mouth rinses have. I don't notice a unique sensation.

I am troubled that the only reason Crest lists for this being for people over 50 is it has no alcohol and has a unique sensation. For this reason I gave this three stars.",3

"Crest Pro-Health Smooth Mint Mouth Rinse falls into the category of refreshing, alcohol-free mouth washes.  It has a pleasant minty flavor.

The active ingredient is 0.07%  cetylpyridinium chloride, a quaternary ammonium cation antiseptic.  Research has shown that it has a small beneficial effect in treating gingivitis and preventing plaque and it is generally regarded as safe when used for short periods of time.  However, I do not think that using antibiotic agents on or in the body on a regular basis in the absence of an infection is a good practice because it interferes with normal, helpful bacteria and can cause health problems.  Oral microbiology in particular is complex and disturbing the natural balance of microorganisms could cause harmful species to proliferate.

I also prefer a stronger, more astringent mouthwash with fluoride.

So while I would recommend this mouthwash for people with gingivitis, I wouldn't recommend it for everyday use for people with healthy teeth and gums.",3

"This may be suitable for some people but it is not really what I need in an eye cream.

Here are the ingredients since the listing on the product page seems to cut off:

Water, caprylic/capric triglyceride, glyceryl stearate, cetyl alcohol, glycerin, cetearyl alcohol, PEG-100 stearate, dimethicone, stearic acid, cetearyl glucoside, tocopherol, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, lavender flower extract, camellia sinensis leaf extract, grape seed oil, bisabolol, jojoba seed oil, sodium hyaluronate, panthenol, PEG/PPG-4/12 dimethicone, silica, xanthan gum, phenoxyethanol, benzyl alcohol, aminomethyl propanol.

There is nothing in here that really makes it any more special than an average facial moisturizer.  It has some moisturizing ingredients (caprylic/capric triglycerides, glycerin, aloe, sodium hyaluronate, grapeseed oil, jojoba oil).  It has some antioxidants (from the tea leaf extract).  The moisturizing effects may help diminish the appearance of fine lines; hyaluronate, for example, holds on to a lot of water and may have a plumping effect.  I don't have much in the way of fine lines, but I am not really seeing a difference in the ones I do have after applying this every morning for awhile now.

For what it's worth, this does have some silicones in it.

If you have really sensitive eyes and can't use most other eye creams, this could be an option for you.  It is non-irritating, even when used on sensitive/thin skin.  I have been using this in the morning before putting in my contact lenses and it doesn't bother my eyes at all.  You don't need a lot at once so one container will last a long time, making this a pretty good value.

But, in the end, I feel like this is not the eye cream for me.  I am looking for something with a few more active ingredients designed specifically for the eye area.",3
"I just recently started shaving again with an electric razor after 40 years of blades. I bought the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Philips-Norelco-1150x-40-SensoTouch-2d-Electric-Shaver-Metallic-Blue/dp/B003V360NY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue</a>&nbsp;and absolutely love it. Today's razors are so much better than years ago.

Even though this is a wet or dry shave razor it seemed to drag a bit when dry shaving. Maybe because of some slight perspiration I don't know, but it did not move smoothly over my skin. Than I thought of Williams Lectric Shave, something I have heard of for years but never tried.

The first thing I did when I got it home was smell it and was not impressed with the odor, in fact I thought it was extremely unpleasent. I figured I'll use it to shave, than wash it off and that will be the end of it. But NOooo I shaved than washed it off 1 time, 2 times than a third time and the smell did not disappear from my face or hands. Plus the odor lingered for hours. I don't know if it is just me but I think the smell is just awful And I would not buy it again just for that reason. I would check out the other brands on the market.

As for the actual purpose of this lotion, I was impressed it worked exceptionally well. The razor glided over my face without any kind of drag and evidently did what it was supposed to since I got an exceptionally close comfortable shave.

So 5 stars for the shave and 1 star for the Odor. I have plenty of after shave lotions that I really like and resent the fact that I am forced to use there odor if I want a good shave. Odorless for this product would be a definite plus. My 2 cats won't eat any treats I give them if I have this odor on my hands, at least I have 2 paw's up on my assessment of the odor. Ha!",3
"I love Pre de Provence soaps, in part because they are powerfully, yet pleasantly fragrant. My bathroom often smells like a spa. Here, the description was not kidding when it noted that these dried lavender blossoms provide a ""subtle"" scent. It's so subtle, I basically have to put my nose within inches of it to smell anything at all.  I've always enjoyed the scent of lavender, and with a busy household I had hoped to use this as a potpourri to improve various mystery smells that can occur in a home with two kids. Unfortunately, it didn't work the way I had hoped.  While the dried blossoms are amusing to play with, as dried herbs often are, they are not exactly pretty compared to flower petal potpourri. It's also sad that the bag is not designed to be resealed. If you're careful you may be able to use the original sticky seal, but you have to be very careful opening and closing the bag. For all of these reasons, but especially the lack of smell, I'm afraid this is one Pre de Provence product I am not able to recommend.",3
"I buy a lot of lavender to use in everything from sachets to lemonade. I had high hopes for this bag of lavender from Pre de Provence, but I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. Lavender should have a fresh scent and a nice purple color. The range of purple can vary between varieties, but should never be dull and gray.  I took a photo of this lavender next to a tin of lavender I bought a few months ago from Fairview Lavender Farm in Kentucky, and you can see a huge difference. The scent is also fresher in the tin than in the bag from Pre de Provence. I have ordered bulk dried lavender blossoms from Provence and it's not always as nice as domestic lavender, but it's rarely this dull.

That said, the scent is nice and it will work well in a loosely covered dish or sachet where appearance doesn't matter as much. I would probably refresh this lavender with a pure lavender oil after a while. It's okay, but it wouldn't be my first choice in dried lavender blossoms.",3
"This set contains a nail polish and a topcoat, which are meant to give the appearance of a gel manicure.  They are also supposed to provide the longevity of a gel manicure, without the need for a curing light or the difficult removal process.  The color I received, Beau-Tie, is a pretty deep purple creme.  It looks quite blue-leaning in the bottle, but is actually much warmer on the nail.  In any case, the color was pretty, and the polish did look nice on my nails.  The instructions say to use the polish on bare nails (no base coat), do two coats, and follow with a coat of topper.  I did this, and I did have a nice, shiny manicure.  The shine was obvious, but I'm not convinced that it's anything exclusive to Essie.  There are other topcoats that will give you a similar appearance.  This polish definitely did not last the two weeks that the package claimed it would.  I found it lasted for about as long as any other polish when worn with a good topcoat- about four days.  The bigger issue, for me, is that without a base coat, my nails were in rough shape when this polish started chipping and I removed it.  They've been weak, peeling, and splitting.  The result is that I won't be wearing this without base coat again.  The bigger takeaway is that I don't find this to be fundamentally different from other nail polishes.  The ""gel couture"" business seems like a gimmick.  Also, I'm accustomed to using a quick dry topcoat, and this one takes much longer.  Be advised!",3
"This is one of the more effective water filters I've used.  It states 300 gallon service capacity.  At least I've used them for over that amount without issue.

When you change filters, the flow acts funny for about the first half gallon - that's normal.  Some filters produce cloudy-looking water for the first gallon, but this one doesn't.  I've had no issues with these filters.

This is by far the simplest, most secure and easiest filter to install that I've experienced.  Also, I didn't find a better deal anywhere else including the manufacturer's site.  They try to sell these single by single, but sometimes in a pack of three.

It's just another filter to keep buying at its hefty price.  But its easy to install.",3
"At first this contraption was a little confusing. I read the directions about 3 times before I felt okay about going through with the project - was not fully confident as there were a lot of warnings about making sure the drill was going the right way/you turned it the right way so you wouldn't lose rods in the dryer vent. Scared me a little. However, the project turned out really well. We didn't lose any rods (thankfully) and we got out the birds nest that had taken residence in our dryer vent!!
The part that was for the lint catcher was convenient as well and is actually recommended to be used at least once a month in order to clean out the lint catcher. I do need to keep up with this but it isn't convenient to have to put together and tape the rods each time when you only really use it for a couple of minutes. However, if you have a handy space to keep it already together, I can see how this would be even better for keeping up with cleaning the lint out.",3
"first thing first: it works. the kit is great in what it consists of and the price is just right i think. to call someone to clean my dryer vents i got quoted from 80 all the way up to 200 bucks. so if you were able to do it yourself you will need to invest a bit more in a ""construction"" vacuum that cost about 80-100 bucks and start the savings basically from the second time you do it.

so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush...

another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector.

with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!",3

"Bought these shoes with HIIT in mind, but not too sure how I like the fit on my foot. First time to wear them, not great for running. Maybe after they're broken in a little they'll get better. If you just need a comfortable pair of shoes for walking, they're fine.",3
"Good indoor training shoes for running on treadmill, doing lunges and regular exercises at the gym. These are very flexible, light weight and comfortable. Grip is okay - sticky rubber is used only at the edges of heel and toe areas so I slipped a little when I worked on cable machines, resistance band, etc. on un-carpeted floor.  I would emphasize that if you do lifting as a part of your everyday routine workout I would not recommend them because mine (cushion) lasted only for six months and this is the reason I gave three stars. Other than that, I liked them!",3
"I got the impression it's cushiony and comfy by reading the reviews on this product, when i tried it on it was a much firmer than my other work shoes, i'm standing all day and need enough support and comfort, this isn't the right product for that.
So i had to return it, but i would assume it would work fine for training.

It looks decent and clean. and seems sturdy.  just not the right thing for me.
I was refunded instantly upon returning so.. credit for that.",3
"I bought a pair of these in my size, but they are too small. I can get my feet in them but not comfortably. It's too bad because I can tell the soles are comfortable. Of course, now I've work them to work so I can't return them.",3
Took other reviewers advice and went up half size and it was too large. I thought this was a more sock-like fit but it had a tongue that came up high on my ankle not at all sock like. Nice looking and very light weight with a rounded square toe that left plenty of room front foot and toes. These just weren't what I was looking for.,3
"These shoes look really great. However, slightly loose. The problems with lack of support arose when I exercised. It feels like there is little to no support in them. Possibly this is a shoe more geared for an office environment or short walking distances.",3
"I LOVE the look and comfort of these shoes for style and lifting weights. Super cute and flezable. BUT for running, absolutely not!! It might just be my pronation/supnation and these shoes just do not work for my personal stride. I run about 2-4 miles every few days. Average of 8 miles a week and then sprints twice a week on a treadmill. Just after running with these 3 times, I am having major back issues that I have never had before.

MY STATS and other shoes:
I road and trail run. I run on my tip toes on the treadmill and a lot of heal on the road. I am 5'6 169lbs with more muscle than an average runner. Built more like a sprinter than a marathon runner.
I LOVE Nike FLEX bottoms. They really give me support and flex needed. I have also used Asics and Puma.",3
"Super cute shoe however runs wide and big, I'm a size 10 however this size 10 is too big. I went to a sporting goods store and tried the same shoe on  turns out with this particular shoe I'm a 9.5, so order half the size u normally are.",3
"This is a shoe I will wear with black dress pants or jeans when I need comfort and a little style, but I am not impressed.  This is a very flimsy shoe with little support at all.  Not like any Nike I've ever purchased in the past.  It looks nice, but it's not comfortable.",3
"Cute card. But I would have liked it to come in a tin. As one of the ones I ordered, the card was bent in half. And couldn't have been done by post office as they were in a box.",3
"Just didn't  know  it was for a girl  gift card, and I was  looking  around  Christmas tree  gifts  cards and type  in right  it was for a boy and I did the e card so he could use it then.",3
"The gift card is obviously just fine, but the ribbon on the box is not the color pictured in the first picture; if you scroll down to the 5th picture, you'll see something more like the actual.  It is two or three shades lighter than shown so looks less classy, in my book.  The picture makes it look as if it is a deep, rich wine color.  And of course, the bow would have to be ironed to look as perky as in the picture.  It comes rather flattened, wrapped in plastic.",3
"The movie ticket worked on both FandangoNow and Fandango website. If you use it to buy digital movies on FandangoNow, sometimes they ran promotion with other onsite movie sponsors for a free promotional movie ticket.

Update on 6/30/2017, as this gift card only can be used without any other promo code available from Fandango, FandangoNow, or any other parties.",3
"As a result, I ordered one or two as Christmas gifts.  We were not as enthralled with the restaurant. Not many here in Atlanta",3
"I thought this would be a hit for several people but not so.  The quality differs tremendously by store.  For instance, the one in Highlands, N. C. is excellent - ingredients always fresh; very clean, etc.  We stopped at several in Fla. and were very disappointed.  The veggies looks ""whipped out"" and the over-all ambience of the place was negative.  No ore SUBWAY gift certs.",3
wish they labeled the $ on the card. i got a giant box of 17 at various $ amounts and i had to call each card to make sure i gift the correct card to the right person.,3
"Fun gift card. The kids loved this for the holidays and so did my husband. A little treat for them from our usual very healthy home diet, yet doesn't tempt me!  Perfect gift for everyone.",3
"DID NOT WORK IN STORE. I'm used to the fact that most Amazon eGift cards don't work in store - they usually just work online, which is fine. This is the first eGift card I tried to use while shopping and it was a disaster. Sephora employees are infamous for being snotty and they acted like I was a complete idiot for trying to use the card. Stood there for 30 minutes and called a few different customer service numbers to see why it wouldn't work, yada yada yada, waste of time and energy. But, it works online, so that's good.",3
"After I gave the card to my wife for her birthday, we found the card far less convenient than a standard credit card.",3
"The gift card and outside of the tin get 5 stars on this.  The inside of the tin, however, is the cause for a 3-star review.  I thought the black inner holder (if you will) would come with the tin, as pictured.  However, when I received it, the gift card is loose inside of the tin, and there's no way to secure it inside the tin.  This is probably a minor detail, but I'm very into the appearance of gifts, so I'm a bit disappointed.",3
it came without labels and i ordered 17 of these. 4 of which were 25 dolars and 6 of them were 35 dollars and the rest were 50 dollars. i had to call every single one to make sure i gift the correct amount to the right person. i wish amazon labeled it.,3
"Details is a mildly interesting magazine that is geared toward men of various ages and lifestyles. The main group that Details aims to capture is the 17 to 35 year- old male but there are articles in each magazine that could be appealing to men of many different ages, mostly in the middle to upper income groups.

Some things about Details quickly set it apart from other magazines. One difference is the ""departments"". Most magazines have departments, but instead of talking about the same things each month, these departments vary in their content (the only exceptions being ""Know- Tell"" and the ""The Details""). Each one contains similar stories from one month to the next, but with different subtitles, helping to make each issue a little fresher than it would otherwise be.

As far as the writing goes, Details offers a great deal of diversity for a magazine. Yes, it is generally focused on things of interest to men, but it covers a very broad range of interests. You can find articles in this magazine on such diverse topics as the death penalty, raising kids, buying a new coat, setting up an internet business, breaking up with a girlfriend, or purchasing the best vodka. There are articles geared toward single men and married men, as well as younger men and middle- aged men.

I like some of the articles found here but there is one problem I have with the writing in Details. It is common to find eye- catching headlines on the cover of Details that tempt you to find out more. This is nothing new and most every magazine does this. But the problem is that many of these eye- popping stories fail to keep you amazed when you read them. Take for example an article in a recent issue. On the front, it reads ""Is Your Wife a Bad Mom""? It sound like an engaging, intellectual read. But once you find the article and take in its 1,000+ words, you quickly discover that there is little or no substance. Basically, it simply tells men that accusing your wife of being a bad mom is a risky undertaking that could hurt her feelings. That is it. There is no intellectual analysis or quotes from studies; only the bottom line conclusion that mothers generally don't like to be called incompetent by their husbands. Other headlining articles in this magazine lead to similar disappointment.

The writing in this magazine is on the edge and very blunt. It is common to find several four- letter words in many of the articles and while this doesn't bother me at all, I know that some readers will consider it too raw, too edgy, and too explicit. Details writers have no problem telling it like it is, and this can be both good and bad depending on one's perspective.

Besides the language, some parts of this magazine could offend certain readers; namely the ""Anthropology"" page at the end. This closing ""article"" is meant to be humorous, but some readers will not see it that way. I don't know if it has always been this way, but what ""Anthropology"" does is show a person or multiple people and then asks the question ""Gay or ______"". For example, I have seen titles like ""Gay or Best Friends?"", ""Gay or Cowboy?"", ""Gay or Neo Punk Rocker?"", and others. With each of these, there is a diagram of sorts with arrows pointing to different clothing and bodily features and short comments about each one. Basically, it is asking you to think about these different attributes of the person or people in the picture and then decide if the way they dress, look, and act makes them gay. I find this silly and immature, but I can see how some readers would find it insulting. I don't know if Details has always done this or if the Anthropology page has been different in the past. But this is how it has been in every issue I have read and it needs to be changed.

Advertisements claim about sixty percent of the pages in each issue of this magazine. They cover products like liquor, cars, electronics, cigarettes, fragrance, etc. Even though this magazine covers lots of different things, the item most often featured in the advertisements is clothing. The magazine seems to have a penchant for high fashion and it devotes more pages to expensive clothing than anything else. And each issue often has its own unique smell, thanks to all of the cologne samples. You can flip through the pages and find several samples in each issue, with many of the latest and trendiest scents from the biggest names in cologne.

Overall, I am torn between liking or not liking Details Magazine. I like some of the articles on food, drink, politics and the like. But I don't necessarily like the shallow fluff that is often substituted for an intellectual discussion and I can understand how some readers would find certain aspects of this magazine insulting. This magazine is deserving of only about two and one- half stars which I will round up to three stars and give a small recommendation. Some will like this magazine and some will not. It's all a matter of what you like to read about and whether or not you can handle a magazine that pushes the envelope.",3
"Wired is a semi- interesting magazine that blends together articles about technology with those on politics, culture, and more. This magazine is aimed at a diverse audience but it generally caters to those who are technology savvy and like to keep up with the latest world events.

Wired dedicates most of its pages to the discussion of electronics and other technology and computer nerds form a large percentage of the magazine's core subscribers. Articles about digital cameras, high definition televisions, internet marketing, and other like topics can be found in every issue. These articles often present unique angles on common problems and concerns in the world of high tech.

What makes Wired interesting is the fact that it includes other articles on other subjects- topics that one normally would not associate with a technology magazine. It is common to find articles about popular culture, politics, and other topics and they sometimes seem out of place. One minute you're reading an article about PDA's and the next minute you're reading an article about the war against Iraq. It's a little weird but it also makes for a nice change of pace as you read.

Another interesting fact with Wired is that it changes its authors more frequently than other magazines. The magazine has a few regulars but it likes to shuffle the writers around each month. This can be good and it can result in articles that present new and different perspectives each month. But it also means that the magazine is a little uneven and can sometimes include articles that do not communicate the way they should. I can recall reading several articles that left me scratching my head, wondering why the editor didn't make additional changes so that the articles were clearer.

The departments in Wired cover a large percentage of the space in every issue and they exceed the total length of many other magazines' department sections. The departments (with the exception of one) occupy the first two- thirds of each issue. The monthly featured articles are found near the end of each issue. This layout is different from other magazines that mix the departments and monthly features together. With Wired, the departments and featured articles are kept separate.

Overall, I like Wired as a whole and the political articles rank as my favorite part of each issue. The magazine jumps around from topic to topic and the authors change more frequently than other magazines; two facts that could make Wired a little too scattered for certain readers. Some of the articles are not the best written I have ever seen but Wired is still a good enough magazine to recommend. It keeps readers current on technology, politics, business, and entertainment with a reputation for being modern and hip.",3
"Seventeen magazine has grown up a lot in the past few year...I am not sure how I feel about that as it tends to mirror the Cosmopolitan magazine quite a bit.  I just wonder how far is too far, because although people don't want to admit it magazines are a part of culture we all looked up to at that time in our lives.  To see the coolest clothes, hair and even questions we were too scared to ask anyone.  I still see that in Seventeen but I also see more sexually oriented material.  I feel some of the stories are stupid.  I still will pick up my sister's Seventeen magazine to see what they have to say and it is amazing how stupid we are trying to make our girls!  A couple of the articles that really fueled me were:  there was a girl who wore short (nasty) skirts to the mall and someone took a picture up her skirt.  When asked what she wears to the mall she answered the SAME THING!  She just wanted attention...that is one reason girls have problems.  Another one was a girl who wore lingerie online and was upset over men-and still has the website!  GET REAL!  What is wrong with the world when these are two of the stories that were main ones in the magazine?!?!  What are girls to learn?  Dress like a skank and get treated like one but continue it?  I don't know about this magazine anymore...I guess it is moving with the times?!  But, my sister still reads it mostly for horoscopes and the music/actors/actresses articles.  My sister said she will not be renewing her subscription  to this magazine after this year as it has turned to trash.",3
"GQ magazine has been around for a long time and, like other men's magazines, it has changed over the years. In an effort to attract more readers, GQ has spiced up some of its articles with more sex and it is common to find a scantily clad female on the cover- a place that used to be reserved exclusively for men. This isn't to say that the articles have suffered greatly from the changeover. There are still several good articles in each issue of GQ, combined with a few too many articles about relationships.

When GQ is at its best is when the magazine is talking politics, entertainment, and/or culture. I have read many interesting political articles in GQ, ranging from topics like homeland security to men's rights when it comes to abortion. The entertainment articles are also quite good and the GQ team can be counted on to deliver some good, frank discussion about movies, books, movies, Hollywood celebrities, etc.

GQ used to seem a little more fashion oriented than it is today. There are still several fashion related articles in each issue but the difference is that the GQ of today contains articles in a wider range of topics than in the past. This is fine by me, because the fashion articles rank low on my list of reading priorities. I would much rather read, say, an article that debates the efforts to ban smoking than an article about buying the right shoes to wear in a business casual workplace.

Many magazines skimp when it comes to reading material but not GQ. You get your money's worth with this magazine. Each issue is the length of a book, with anywhere from 250 to 350 or more pages per issue and from 25 to 30 different featured articles, departments, and monthly columns to read (combined). This makes for a lot of reading. Even of you take the advertisement space into account, there is still plenty to read in each issue. It also means that, whatever your fancy, you should find something interesting to read every month.

Overall, GQ is a good magazine for men and it contains some decent entertainment news, political analysis, and fashion tips. It is aimed at men in their early thirties and while I don't like it as much as similar publications I still think GQ is a decent magazine. Its long length makes it easily worth the low cost and with so much reading material, there is something for everyone in each issue. What others have said is true: It isn't the magazine it once was. But there is still enough of the good stuff to recommend this publication.",3
"Writer's Digest is a magazine designed for writers and it attempts to cover many different aspects of writing in its columns and featured articles. Most every issue offers at least one interview with a famous or semi- famous author. This spotlighted author could be the author of a book, a screen writer, or some other type of author. These interviews offer some good insight into writing success and the necessary skills and sacrifices to succeed at your chosen craft.

Aside from the interviews, Writer's Digest is basically a magazine of tips and advice. One issue might talk about ways to break into the business of movie reviewing for newspapers. Another might talk about ways to make your writing more concise and less wordy. Still another article might discuss ways to overcome writer's block. The main goal of Writer's Digest is to help the reader become a better writer and, hopefully, gain an offer for a publication at some point in the future.

One thing that is a little different with Writer's Digest is that it doesn't contain the long list of standard monthly departments like you find in other magazines. With Writer's Digest, the departments are de-emphasized and there are only a few of them in each issue. The rest of Writer's Digest is dedicated to columns and featured articles. This format is unique and it makes Writer's Digest a good choice for those who like change and prefer to read something different in each issue.

Writer's Digest does contain a pretty good number of advertisements, but the ads are usually for writing conferences, writing software, writing contests, or ads that encourage a visit to the magazine's own web site. Because the ads stay so focused on the subject of writing, they don't seem all that bad and they are not distracting. I know some Writer's Digest readers who actually look forward to the ads so that they can find information on the latest contests. And speaking of the magazine's web site, it seems to be an important component of the magazine because it is referenced on many pages throughout each issue.

Writer's Digest is a pretty good magazine for writer and I like it for its advice and classified ads more than anything. The success stories can sometimes get a bit carried away and they make it look a little too easy to land a huge writing contract. It would also be nice if Writer's Digest was published monthly rather than semi- monthly. But Writer's Digest is still a good magazine for writers everywhere, with plenty of good advice and tips to help you become the writer you always knew you could be.",3
"This magazine is a product of CondeNet publishing and it is aimed at the younger female market, roughly from ages 18 to 30. This publication is a shopper's paradise, with more advertising than most any other magazine on the market.

I got a complimentary subscription to this magazine one day and I accepted, not only because it was free, but also because I really didn't know it was a woman's fashion magazine. With a title like ""Lucky"", there were all sorts of possibilities. It could have been about gambling, sweepstakes, or about getting lucky. I didn't know it was a woman's magazine, so I accepted it. And from what I can see, this magazine is one of average worth to the average person and it will appeal mostly to younger women.

Fashion covers a good amount of the magazine's 200 plus pages. Beauty tips are another important area of coverage. It is also common to see samples of different products inside the pages of each issue. Things like perfume samples, shampoo, and other things can be found buried somewhere within each copy. The coverage includes casual as well as high- class clothing and beauty products, with most of it falling at the upper end of the cost scale.

If you can tolerate the clogging of advertisements, this magazine might be a good choice for the younger female crowd that likes to keep in- tune with the latest styles and trends. Outside of that targeted market, however, I don't see much use for Lucky magazine. The photography is very good and the presentation is professional, but the magazine will likely be rated average by a large cross- section of the population.",3
"I have been a subscriber to Runner's World Magazine for the past four years.  I have watched, in dismay, the slow and sure descent of this magazine into the clutches of marketers.  Let me give you an example:

Runner's World April 2013.
Page 46.  Magazine recommends eggs in an added on box in the bottom right corner of the page.
Page 67.  Magazine recommends eggs again stating that studies (which studies?) show that eating eggs helps reduce calorie intake.  Large picture of a fried egg.  Also several recipes recommend eggs (on the same page).
Page 45.  Paid advertisement for egg whites.

Page 31.  Magazine recommends chocolate milk as an after workout recovery (gross!)
Page 67.  Magazine has picture of milk cartons, recommend fat free milk.
Page 74.  Magazine recommends chocolate milk again.  With picture this time.
Page 39.  Paid advertisement for chocolate milk.

Seeing a trend?  It's sad really, because where is the line going to be drawn?  I don't mind the advertisements, but when the magazine starts working in recommendations based on what ads have been bought a particular month?  Will Runner's World recommend M&Ms as a post run recovery if Mars Candy Company puts in an add?  Granted chocolate milk and eggs aren't the worst... but seriously recommending eggs for a runner to lose weight?  Should we ignore the cholesterol and fat content?  Again, just picking on one thing, but I can see a trend starting to develop.

That alone wouldn't be enough to completely turn me off the magazine though.  The ads have gotten more numerous it seems, and actual content has shrunk.  More of the content is being devoted to recipes and repetitive training tips.  Great for those who buy this magazine on occasion from the new stand, but not for subscribers.  The beginners' tips are getting so repetitive that I can predict exactly what will be recommended:
> Start out slow.
> Interval train.
> Post run stretch.
> Take days off when needed.
> Slowly add mileage.
> Back off if too sore or injured or strained.

Also, the rave run section at the beginning?  A big glossy picture of a cool location I probably won't be able to run.  Newbie chronicles?  The stories can be humorous, but are usually just a recap of an run that a beginner took that inspired them to run more often.  There are usually a few recipes, but often they are geared towards meat eaters and don't have any really easy way to modify them for vegetarians or vegans.  I did see one recipe where the author mentioned subbing tofu and another ingredient to make it vegan.  But this is rare.  The shoe reviews have become a joke.  Basically you can expect several shoes to get 'awards' or a 'best update', but often they are incomplete comparisons and they do not have the user notes any longer.  (They used to include a few lines from testers about what they liked, now they just have one or two lines by testers per guide, not per shoe).

The best section?  ""Ask Miles.""

Also, periodically there are very good and inspiring stories.  But a lot of the stories are fluff.  It's just not worth a subscription anymore.  I bought the following book for cheap - MUCH cheaper than Runner's World was trying to sell it directly to subscribers for:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Runner-s-World-Complete-Book-of-Running-Everything-You-Need-to-Run-for-Weight-Loss-Fitness-and-Competition/dp/1605295795/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Runner's World Complete Book of Running: Everything You Need to Run for Weight Loss, Fitness, and Competition</a>.  $15 brand new from Amazon.  The magazine e-mailed me a trial offer for this book with the final billed amount at $35.  Sad.  But my recommendation?  Until the magazine gets back to where it was 2+ years ago, skip it.  If you really want packed information about running and training, buy the book I mentioned.  At least it's ad free!

My recommendation?  Stick to running gear ads and get away from food product ads, I think that is an area that makes money but also puts the magazine at the liberty of some of the most unscrupulous advertisers in the country (remember, food companies often pay grocery stores for better shelf space and for their products to be featured in ads and circulars).  I would also revamp the rave run section and have several (smaller) pictures of at least a dozen locations each month scattered around the country.  You could even ask readers to send in pictures and locations.  Give us a slice instead of blowing up one giant photo.  And with a selection, perhaps one of these runs might be close by.  Also have more stories and information for mid level runners.  More product reviews - the earbud reviews were nice, but there were only six or so.  That is not acceptable.  Give us 20+ earbuds and just list the ones that aren't recommended.  And try buying the products out of the budget rather than having vendors give them to the magazine.  I understand that is the nature of the game: ""want it reviewed?  Give it to us.""  But often this makes incomplete review guides.

I don't want Runner's World to go the route Outside Magazine did several years ago.  Remember the readers and the runners are #1, not advertisers.  Give the magazine the old substance and pay attention to subscribers.  Don't sacrifice the quality overall just to appeal to those folks browsing the magazine rack at Barnes and Noble.  I have another year or so left on my subscription (silly 2 year renewal!), hopefully I will see a nice improvement in that time.  And I don't think I'm alone in this.",3
"Maxim is a monthly publication aimed at the younger male population, aged 16 to 30. This magazine offers a few amusing tidbits each month, like jokes and unusual ways to make things. There is an occasional fashion article, and some monthly articles on electronic gadgets and music. But the primary reason why people buy Maxim and the main reason it sells as well as it does is the women.
Maxim is not really an adult magazine, like Playboy or Penthouse. Its photographs do not expose so much that they should garner an X rating. But many of them come very close. From the picture on the cover (always a young woman, often with a seductive look in her eyes and much flesh exposed) to the photos in the middle, Maxim uses sex to sell. It isn't strictly a photo- op magazine for young women. There are interviews to accompany the visual effects. But the small talk is almost always geared toward sex- how to get it, how to keep getting it for a long time, how to improve your chances to get it, how to help friends get it, how to turn women on, etc.
The photos in Maxim are enticing, and I don't think any red- blooded American male would deny this fact. But what hurts Maxim a little bit and what keeps it from gaining as much respect as it could have is the monthly dose of stupidity that comes with each issue. Much of what you find in the ""How to"" section, for example, is idiotic and I cannot imagine anyone taking it seriously. The ""Bar Exam"" feature is also bordering on stupidity, with a set of trivia questions each month about some type of useless information.
Overall, I think Maxim is at least an average magazine, in spite of its flaws. Yes, many of the articles are brainless and the humor is the type that would amuse a 12- year old. But the main reason people buy and read (or should I say look) at Maxim is the photographs of the women. With so much flesh exposed, without going to far, Maxim is a publication with a purely visual bend. You won't find much intelligence here, but you will find plenty of photos of scantily clad women, tempting your hormones with their youthful good looks and uninhibited personalities.",3
"Men's Journal is a decent magazine full of varied topics of interest to men. This magazine covers areas like sports, adventure travel, fashion and style, cars and trucks, career issues, etc. This publication directs all of its articles toward men, with an emphasis on what is most appealing to males throughout a typical week in their lives.

One thing about Men's Journal that is a little different from other men's magazines is that it doesn't flaunt women to sell its issues. In fact, there are practically no pictures of women at all in this publication- something that will be considered an asset to some, and a liability to others. This magazine refuses to play the female card and instead focuses its articles on topics that men like to read about.

Men's Journal is often obsessed with lists, and I think this is especially true in the last few years. Take a look at the cover of most issues and you will see a large, boldface advertisement for some sort of list. In one issue, it might be a ranking of the best cities for entry level jobs. In another issue, it might be a listing of the best places for young entrepreneurs. Whatever it might be, Men's Journal seems to have an infatuation with lists, probably because men like lists and it helps increase sales.

This magazine can be counted on to produce some fairly good reading, but I must warn that many of the articles are a little too simplistic, with little emphasis on intellectualism. Even the articles about politics and business are often riddled with obvious statements that most anyone would know. But overall, I still think Men's Journal is a good magazine. It is varied enough that most anyone will find something interesting to read and the price is very low.",3
"Food and Wine is a pretty good magazine for those who enjoy the finer things in life when it comes to unusual cuisine and expensive fermented beverages. This publication is usually very long- over 250 pages- and its packed full of recipes, travel excursions to wine growing regions, and general facts about different varieties of wine and where to find them.

One thing about this magazine that surprised me at first is the emphasis on the food. I know the magazine is titled ""Food and Wine"", but my initial impression was that this would be a magazine devoted entirely to wine with occasional mention of the foods that go with wine. It isn't like that at all. The food sections and the recipes are just as important as the featured wines. Recipes are so frequent, in fact, that the magazine even has an index located near the front with all the recipes listed by food type, showing the page number to turn to for the recipe.

Besides the frequent talk about food and wine, this magazine is also dedicated to entertaining. I have heard it suggested that this magazine should change its name to ""Food, Wine, and Entertainment"". It would make sense, because conviviality and high- class partying are certainly an important component of this magazine.

There is one thing about Food and Wine that I wish was different. I appreciate the factual information and I like the personal touch that you find in some of the stories about winery owners, chefs, and the like. But I think Food and Wine gets a little too sidetracked from time to time in its reporting. For example, it is common to find stories that talk about subjects like home decorating. This would be fine in a magazine about home design, but I don't think it belongs in a magazine like this.

Overall, this is still a good publication. Lovers of great eats and fine drinks will enjoy it the most. It's worth taking a look, if nothing else, just for the recipes. Even if you're not a frequent imbiber of the fruit of the vine, there is still something of interest to be found in the pages of this magazine.",3
"I first encountered Girls' Life at my friend's house, an avid reader. Flipping through the magazine, I saw some good, okay, and bad features. Girls Life is targeted to ages 10-15, and it's good for those parents who feel as though their kid is too old for American Girl but still not old enough for YM, Teen People, etc. This magazine has advertisments, but not that many, and they're nothing inappropriate, just things like Smackers lip gloss or Secret deodorant.
I think this magazine is appropriate for the age group that it is targeted to. Girls' Life has articles about school, boys, seasonal articles about holidays, fashion, real-life, celebrities (though there isn't any gossip about who's doing what),  beauty, and other topics. I don't think you should read this magazine for it's beauty and fashion articles; try Teen Vogue or Teen People for fasion and beauty. Plus, there are quizzes, celebrity features and articles, embarrasing moments stories, advice to questions sent in by real girls, letters to the editor (of course!), and other fun features. You won't find any articles about sex and college, however.
My only problem with this magazine is obviously that the editors don't know what kind of girls to put on the cover and in their fashion and beauty pages. Usually, there are regular girls on the cover, sometimes a celebrity. But the thing is, Girls' Life usually doesn't put normal girls with glasses, freckels, dark hair or skin, or non-straight hair. Most of them feed us the picture of the ideal girl: tall, blonde-haird, blue-eyed, perfect complexion, no glasses, no freckels. That can ruin a girl's self-esteem, so I suggest reading this magazine not for it's models, but for the actual content. Besides from that one problem, Girls' Life would be an okay magazine for girls age 10-15.",3
"This Old House is a magazine dedicated to home improvement. Based on the popular PBS television program, this magazine aims to help its readers find new and better ways to improve the home and perform routine maintenance.

Magazines and the internet are my primary sources when home repair reaches the critical point. This Old House is one of several magazines I like to read and it is the one I turn to most frequently when I need to find out about home maintenance. The majority of other home- related publications deal strictly with enhancements, remodeling, and general improvement. This Old House offers these types of articles, along with articles on general home repair, landscaping techniques, utility cost savings, and more.

My favorite departments in This Old House are ""Around the House"", ""Toolbox"", and ""Salvage"". The last department, Salvage, sounds boring at first but it often gets very creative. This department selects a common household item- usually one that is probably slated to get tossed in the trash- and points out a creative way to re- use the item. Some of the ideas they come up with are surprising, making this one of the first sections I turn to when I get a new issue in the mail.

Some parts of This Old House are not appealing at all, either because the suggestions are far too costly for someone like me; because they involve skills that I do not possess; or a combination of the two. The Luxury department is one such area. Another is the Design sections. These areas are intended for the more advanced home improver who has advanced skills at home design. There are some very expensive suggestions, too, and these parts of the magazine provide more fantasy reading than anything. However, there are still enough less expensive ideas to keep the magazine useful and practical.

Overall, This Old House is a good magazine that offers some home improvement ideas, some repair suggestions, and some ways to enhance your home's value. The general repair advice is pretty handy and while I don't have much use for other parts of the magazine, I can agree that these are helpful to the right type of person. It makes This Old House a good publication for those who seek advice for home repair and home enhancement.",3
"I love traveling, both in the U.S. and internationally and when I received an invite to subscribe to National Geographic Traveler a few years ago, I gladly I've always enjoyed reading the regular National Geographic. I liked the look and content of this magazine and subscribed for three years twice. In a month my subscripiton will come to an end and I doubt I will renew. The quality and quanitity of the magazine has dropped quickly over the last few months. The pages have noticeably been fewer and more advertisements seem to fill most of the pages now.  It just isn' the same magazine that I paid for nearly three years before. As with other magazines of late, I have noticed a disturbing and unsatifactory trend: the quality is going downhill and the magazine has lost about 20 pages. There seems to be a trend out there, sadly, not just with this magazine, and I can't be the only one that notices it, but over the last year or so, some of my favorite magazines have cut down on the amount of pages in each issue and it is noticeable when you handle the issue. I know the economy is in a sh-t, but I did pay in advance for a certain magazine. Suddenly, all these magazines are shrinking the issues without any notice what so over to the subscriber. And they expect to keep us when the price remains the same for less of the magazine. I just don't know. I have noticed that Amazon price beats the price directly offered by the magazine itself and I don't get that. Hopefully, nat Geo Traveler will go back to where it was, though I doubt it, if people are willing to contiually pay the same $$ for less pages, why should they? For this reason, this is another magazine I will not renew. You'd think the publishers would want to keep the subscribers they do have, but they don't. I know because I have contacted editors of a few magazines: Smart Computing for one and the editor first asked me what I missed. When I told him, he couldn't care less. What a bad attitude! Needless to say, I cancelled my three year subscription and received a refund, only partial because they wanted to keep all my money. How do you like that? All I can say is think carefully now before you subscribe to any magazine. I know I am.",3
"I'm a charter subscriber of Women's Health, and honestly I think that's the only reason I stayed subscribed for so long.  ""Oh, but I was one of their first subscribers!""...yeah, who cares?  After I really gave it some thought, I sure didn't care.  The fact that 6 of the last 8 issues were still wrapped in their plastic wrap further confirmed my lack of interest in this magazine.

I used to always snatch my boyfriend's copy of Men's Health when it would arrive in the mail and devour it before he got home from class.  So when Women's Health invited me to try out their first issue, I jumped at the chance.  I was happy that the magazines were very similar, but after awhile it seemed too repetitive.  Then Men's Health itself started changing into something boring and bland and my boyfriend chose to end his subscription.  Now, it seems like the same pattern is emerging with Women's Health.  It went strong for awhile, but now it just feels like they're regurgitating the same information over and over.

It's not so much that Women's Health is a *bad* magazine.  It is informative, it does have decent columns and helpful information.  But it's nothing special.  It doesn't contain any information that I can't find in other (cheaper) places.

I gave it 3 stars because I do think it's a decent magazine to subscribe to for 2-3 years, but not necessarily worth a long-term commitment since you'll likely begin to feel a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu after a time.

Needless to say, my subscription is up for renewal and I'm opting out.",3
"Bottom-line: While ""US Weekly"" is fine for the undemanding and tedious world of the treadmill, I would not read the magazine on continual basis; there is just not enough substance.

The New Year brought a new commitment to fitness; Yeah!  But no, this time I'm serious about want to shed a few pounds and lighten the load on my poor knees.  Of course this mean a copious amount of time on the treadmill shedding those unwanted pound, listening to Christina Aguilera and reading ""US Weekly Magazine,"" which my gym seems to have an over abundance of to the exclusion of any other periodical.

I am not usually given to reading entertainment magazines; I would hate to think of myself as a celebrity hound, but ""US Weekly"" is short on words and long on pictures and advertising; in other words just right for the treadmill machine where my attention is not ripe for reading.  Unlike Entertainment Weekly, or even People, ""US Weekly"" does not pretend to be serious, the magazine does not attempt to cloth itself in the veneer of serious journalism.  ""US Weekly"", which is published, well weekly, is little more than a thin picture book full of the minutiae of celebrity life.

There are no articles in ""US Weekly"", at least not anything that would pass as an article in say Entertainment Weekly, or People; there are instead picture captions and the occasion short write-up (a paragraph or two) on this star or that, or those stars over there.  ""US Weekly"" is just a tad more reputable than say The National Enquirer or Star Magazine, but just barely.  For example, the February 19, 2007 issues' cover featured a colorful full page picture of Reese Witherspoon beside a headline that read Hollywood's Revenge Diets! Better after breakup!  How newly single stars get slim and sexy fast.  Meanwhile a sidebar featured Jennifer Aniston and Jessica Simpson under a title which read Plastic Surgery!  Jennifer was a ""Winner!"" while poor Jessica was ""Scary!"" after her sojourn under the knife.

Regular sections in the magazine include:

o Hot Hollywood
o Hot Pics
o Features
o News
o Style
o In Every Issue

But lack of depth does not prevent the mainstream advertisers from calling; indeed there is an advertisement--mostly courting a female audience--almost every other page.  This is not out of line with other magazines in this genre, although ""US Weekly"" is the only magazine I know of that does not have a masthead.  Based on the advertising and editorial content this is a magazine designed and published for young women.  And that is not to imply that young women are shallow and unfocused on self; I make the statement because there are a lot of (female) style and fashion photos contained therein, along with a fair amount of make-up advertisements.  This is not normally (straight) ""guy"" territory.

Conclusion

While ""US Weekly"" is fine for the undemanding and tedious world of the treadmill, I would not read the magazine on continual basis; there is just not enough substance.  And while I have to admit that (women) celebrities intrigue me, I would rather not read a whole magazine devoted to their every step; ""US Weekly"" is not for me.",3
"You have to look at this magazine in comparison to the one that is ranked right above it in its category - The Economist.

Both magazines download every week and you have the content ahead of anyone who might be waiting for the physical hard copy.  You can be done with next week's magazine before the weekend starts.

Both have a fairly wide ranging look at the business world.  However, the Economist goes further in depth with regions that are not America.  There is a lot of content in the Economist, so much that it is almost hard to read cover to cover every week if you have other things you might want to read.

BusinessWeek's brevity, in this light can be either a detriment or a selling point.  Most of the non-feature articles are around five hundred words.  There is even a greater way to save time, where the bottom of the article has a one-sentence synopsis called ""The Bottom Line"".  It is kind of reductive, but nice if you're pressed for time.

A big drawback is the formatting.  There are no photos in BusinessWeek, nor are there any charts.  It is all text.  The Economist has some photos from the print edition, and as far as I know, all of the charts (Even if they are hard to read at times on the screen).

The selling point is price.  The monthly price is about 30% of that which the Economist is asking for.  As much as I like the Economist, I am keeping my subscription to Business Week because of the premium and the less time I need to spend, even though I am not entirely comfortable with my choice, it feels like the best one.",3
"What made the original Taste of Home a good magazine was the sense of community and sharing. It was a magazine that captured the heart of North American cooks who submitted their tried-and-true recipes. Most, if not all, the recipes used ingredients found in most kitchen cupboards and were homey. The recipes were also easy to prepare.

Between the recipes was folksy blurbs telling about different cooks and their approach to cooking.

The magazine WAS a magazine that featured real home-style recipes.

The current magazine is none of the above. I purchased the November 2011 issue and expected to find some good home-style Thanksgiving recipes. Instead I found few recipes for the upcoming holiday and the ones I found would probably be more at home at a ""gourmet"" type magazine.

The Thanksgiving feature included the following recipes for the TOH menu:

Roasted Parsnip and Pear Soup
Wilted Spinach Salad with Butternut Squash
Cranberry Ricotta Gnocchi with Brown Butter Sauce
Jalapeno Cranberry Sauce
Tangerine-Glazed Turkey
Spiced Pumpkin Custard Pie

While all the recipes are fine, my family would not be happy eating this for Thanksgiving as they are not all that traditional.

A typical Thanksgiving dinner for my family could include:

Relish Tray
Roast Turkey and Dressing
Mashed Potatoes
Green Beans
Cranberry Sauce
Dinner Rolls
Pumpkin Pie, Apple Pie, Cranberry Bread

Each year there may be a slight twists to the old favorites but the core ingredients remain the same.

Finally, the magazine seems glossy and filled with ads. It's just not the same Taste of Home magazine of old including the missing spoon found on every cover.

Do not recommend this magazine as the original magazine is gone.",3
"In recent years it has seemed that Apple has been shifting more attention to iOS. While this makes sense given that they have been getting better market share with iOS it is too bad that development of the Mac OS seems to be slowing down a bit. While Snow Leopard shows a lot of advancements from when OS X first came out it certainly is not a mature product. One of the biggest advancements has been spotlight which was announced in Tiger. Steve Jobs wasn't exaggerating when he said that spotlight alone was worth the buying Tiger. While there have been some nice advancements to spotlight since then it still lacks one important feature in that there is no good way to tag files in the OS. With out tagging it is hard to find the file that you are looking for. I don't see why there isn't at least a tagging option under the save as menu. The save as menu has been designed to be so minimalist that they could easy take advantage of the room to add in some tagging features. A tagging cloud could also be an important addition. Also there has been this weird bug in spotlight for the longest time where it shows a folder icon for everything that is a group of items. It doesn't matter if it is a playlist or an iPhoto event or whatever you just get this generic folder icon. The problem with this is that I will often have events, playlists, and regular folders that have the same name. If they all use the icon there is no way to differentiate them from the others.

When browsing the finder I find that I often want to go back to some place that I was at just a few hours earlier. It would be helpful if Apple brought Safari's history feature over to the Finder. They already wrote this feature so it makes sense that they would bring it across since it would hardly even take them any time. Another feature that I think would take little time to write would be if Mac OS automatically relaunched all the programs that you had open the last time the computer was on. They already have this feature for the Finder why can't it do it for other program windows as well? I also miss the sidebar icons that would expand when you would enlarge a window in Tiger. I don't see why they took that feature out.

Some of the most interesting features to the Mac OS have never made it into a shipping release of Mac OS. They have been features in the beta versions only. The beta of Leopard let you grab random files to make a stack in the dock. If you drag random files in to the dock now you will get separate files for each item. This takes up lots of space in your dock and can make it smaller, a big problem if you have a small laptop monitor. The only way to put multiple files in to the dock is if they all happen to be in the same folder. This isn't anywhere near as handy.

The Safari 4 beta had a feature that would display the tabs across the top of the toolbar area. This helped to make the toolbar smaller so that you could see more of the webpage. It also made it difficult to drag the title bar as their where few places to grab it due to having a close box and and handle to drag and move each tab. I really liked this solution and it could have been improved by getting rid of the close button on the tab. Most everyone knows about the Command-W shortcut and that is sufficient (if they don't know that then they really should learn it.) I liked this implementation of tabs because if you only had one window open you could drag it into a group of other tabs. With Safari 5 there is no way to drag a single window into a group of tabs, you have to have two or more widows open to pull this off. This next feature dates waaaay back. In the original version of the Mac OS X public beta 10 years ago there was a features called single window mode the cleared out the clutter by only having one window open while single window mode was activated. This feature was apparently taken out because it confused people who didn't know why only one window was open at a time. The way I see it is if we can have a caps lock key on our keyboard lets you type only capital letters at a given time then why can't you have a key that lets you use only one window at a time? Perhaps it could light up just like the caps lock key can. I think there really needs to be a way to cut down on window clutter so it is worth putting a key on the keyboard that does that. Perhaps it could be on of the F5 and F6 keys that currently aren't assigned a function? Also going back even further in time I have been told that managing fonts in Mac OS 9 was a lot easier due to their being only one fonts folder. If that could be easy again then it would be a big improvement.

I think it would make sense to merge many of their applications together. If you think about a lot of apps different functions they are mainly to browse the files and then do a few basic operations to those files. For an example iPhoto is basically the Finder for photos, iTunes is basically the Finder for music, video, podcasts, etc. What I could envision would be if you started with a window that looked like the Finder with the same filter bar that you have today that lets you pick the kind of file to filter by. Once you select the file the sidebar and the toolbar would match to match that particular type of file. In other words if you selected music the sidebar would instantly change include Genius, Playlists, store etc, the toolbar would instantly include the play button, rewind, fast-forward, etc. This basic concept was played around with in Windows XP but it only include some of the features that you would need. For an example you would select an image file and it would give you some options for making proof sheets but not a lot more. This feature was later removed in the next version of Windows. I don't think that the feature was taken out due to it being a bad idea I think it was taken out because it only did a small amount of what people would expect a photo program to do. But imagine what it would be like if the Finder did all the basic features that you would expect of very basic photo navigating and editing software? Can you image how convenient that would be? You wouldn't have to keep switching between several programs that all have the same basic function (searching for files) when you had to go search for a file there would one be one application to go to. The functionality would of course be limited to some extent. You wouldn't want to turn the program into Photoshop. You would just want to include enough basic features to easily navigate files and to do some lite editing.

Also I think the it is time to get rid of the hierarchy concept. With the introduction of the iPad we can see that we don't need to depend on this way of searching for files. iPad search works fine without having to go into a folder and then into another folder and then into another folder. I think the concept of collections would work as a fine replacement. The files shouldn't need to be in a certain location on the hard disk in order to be grouped together.

There are also a lot of little fine tuning features that need to be addressed. Spaces have no way of being named just generically label by numbers. You can quickly bring all windows from different spaces into one but there is no way to put them back in the spaces where they originally came from. The background in Dashboard is very light which makes it look cluttered if any windows are open. I think the background should be darker. If there is any confusion to how to get back to the regular view then have a close dashboard button. Sidebars often get filled up with lots of smart folders, smart playlists etc. I think it would make sense to just have an option to show the active smart folder so that the rest of the space could be use for other items or to just show some blank space if you don't want a lot going on, or to use use that space to make the icons larger like they did in Tiger. The rest of the smart folders could then reappear using a show / hide button like in iTunes 10.

And finally each version of Windows usually come with one or two features that would be nice to see on the Mac. The one feature that really stood out to me in Windows 7 was how you can search for applications in the start menu and then get a list of recent documents from that application once you hover the mouse over the application name. It would be nice to see this on the Mac with one big improvement. Often when I launch an application I usually open several documents at one time. I would be nice if there were some check boxes to click on to open multiple documents at the same time. Perhaps they could even have a way of showing if a file was part of a certain collection, playlist, album, photo event, etc and showing a related icon next to the file that is was a part of. By adding these additional adjustments they are not just taking an idea but building upon it.

I would wrap up by saying that OS 10 has come a long ways in the 10 years it has been out but Apple shouldn't slow down. There is still a lot to be done.",3
"Microsoft products are all paranoid.  They assume you are trying to pirate their stuff.  So they are hard to install, understand, use.  This paranoia began with XP, but the paranoia matured in Vista, and is full-fledged, in Win7.  It's positively manic, in Win8.  So frankly, if you value your own sanity, never go beyond Win7.  And keep your XP.  I bought four more copies of XP Pro OS from DigiConcepts here in Amazon, because frankly I don't want to use Win7 much.  Will be dual-booting my XP machines with Linux, to protect against any internet exposure.

Add to this, the complication of whether you should buy a 64-bit or 32-bit MS OS.  Opt for the latter, if you have old files.  User complaints are highest with 64-bit MS OS, because they can't install their old programs.  They can't install, because installation programs are 16-bit, which never works with a 64-bit OS.  MS has not solved the problem with its 'XP MODE', which you can freely download with the 64-bit version of Win7 Pro.  This is true even though 64-bit OS can run 32-bit programs;  it's INSTALLING those programs -- as you always must do, to run them -- which is the problem.  So basically, if you're on 32-bit XP now, don't go to 64-bit Windows 7 unless you are quite informed about the ramifications and you KNOW the software you'll use, is compatible with it.

So, I'm still thinking of buying a separate Win7 32-bit OS; but in order to decide, I bought a used computer at dellauction with Win7 Pro already on it, which cost me less than the software.  I am and remain on XP.  Have five XP machines, one Vista, three Win7, five Win98 machines, and 10 others which are still on DOS.  Will be migrating to Linux, though for now I just use Linux Mint 13 and Fedora 17 on pen drives, saving time.  The 'Windows 8' fiasco has cost me months of downtime just learning WHAT TO BUY.  So I'll try to give the most helpful review I can on Windows 7.  That's where you should stop, unless you love poking your tablet or cellphone.  For Win8 is a glitchy, mysterious, pokey and childish interface, not fit for any desktop.  Just read the Windows 8 upgrade reviews here in Amazon or elsewhere, to see why.  So, your best option if upgrading, is to Win7.

UPSHOT: Win7 is supposed to be safer, but is not.  It is a bit smoother, and it is enough like XP in operation, to not be too much of a transition.  I do NOT recommend installing Win7 over XP, because no Windows 'upgrade' ever goes well.  Microsoft has a philosophy of one OS installation for one machine, so if you put another OS on a machine, there are always unforseen glitches.  That's how I got into Windows, my first machine was one a guy threw out, because he couldn't make a Win98 upgrade work on his Win95 machine. (I'm a DOS junkie, and always will be.)

Always just bite the bullet and do a clean install.  CLONE your hard drive first with Clonezilla and an external drive the same size as the internal drive, so if you don't like Win7, you can just boot up in Clonezilla (here at Amazon in CD for only $8) and copy your clone drive back to your internal drive, in like 20 minutes. (Depending on how big your hard drive: 20 minutes for 60GB.)

And keep your XP machine, or at least that clone drive of it. Win7 is good as a companion, and it eases the transition if you keep your old XP machine.  Can dual-boot, if you know how.

In PC World I did a review of 'Vista vs Win7', using this 'brainout' nickname (my pen name on the internet, aka brainouty in Youtube due to y typo).  Other people made their contributions to the review also, which might prove even more helpful.  Each post is feature-specific.  So you might want to look at that for greater detail.  I tested the main features of both Vista and Windows 7 versus the XP I had, since I bought two used computers with each OS -- the other was Vista Business.

Both are 32-bit, but on 64-bit architecture.  Here, I'll just give highlights in alpha-topical order:

* DVD writing, yes!  Linux was long able to use a DVDRW with its full capabilities, but as you know XP never could.  You had to settle for the buggy Roxio or Nero.  Or, like I learned to do, use some 'live' copy of Linux to do file management including DVD writing and rewriting, then go back to Windows XP for the normal stuff.  In Vista and Win7, you can finally write to your DVD+RW or DVD-RW as if it were a floppy.  And the instructions on usage inside Win7 are superb.  MS' own online instructions about DVD writing, by contrast, will make you tear your hair out.  It's worth buying the OS for this feature alone, especially if you get a used machine.  Very happy feature.  Of course, they TAKE IT AWAY, in Win8!  That's MS for ya: always wrecking what worked, and replacing it with an inferior feature.  So get Win7 while you can, either as an OS like here, or as a separate machine.  The DVD function will prove important long-term, as they archive best.  I'm not a fan of Blu-Ray drives, because they hold too much data and any CD/DVD can easily be scratched and rendered unusable (though someone claimed you can restore them with toothpaste, lol).

*  EXPLORER is similar to XP, but now too much white space, and the insertion of added categories near the top of Explorer is disorienting.  You might like these, though I don't:  Libraries, Contacts, with Favorites instead of 'Desktop' at the very top.  'Libraries' is a confusing repository of shortcuts to named categories you can't change but can copy to.  It's just a house of locations elsewhere, but seeing WHERE those other files are, is not easy to do, within 'Libraries'.  'Contacts' replaces your address book.  Favorites remains the same in meaning.  But that added topspace is annoying.  One good thing, your 'My Documents' folder doesn't have to auto-expand, anymore.  (Big pain, in XP, always having to collapse My documents every time you open Windows Explorer.)

In particular, Vista changed file organization such that My Documents is no longer under Documents and Settings, but rather in a USERS directory.  Vista's EXPLORER is constantly annoying, as you'll forever be clicking on Documents and Settings, but will be denied entry.  That's because the files are no longer really there, but in the USERS directory.  Win7 preserves this organization, so it's confusing.  Solution is just to make a shortcut, put it in a Desktop toolbar, and keep that toolbar in the same place as your taskbar.

*  HELP is far better in Win7.  Actually makes sense for a change.  They reorganized all the functions into central locations, yet at the same time preserved the dialogue boxes you're used to seeing.  Basically, you right-click wherever you are, and help related to what you're on, will appear as an option.  For example, as before, right-click on the desktop when not on an icon, and you get Personalize (instead of Properties), which gives you a more centralized method of changing the look and feel and interface of Windows 7.

Other HELP appears pretty quickly in other contexts.

*  INTERNETTING is smoother in Win7.  Not bad in Vista, either.  IE 9 is useless, but so has been every IE since IE7.  Firefox is most flexible, Chrome most buggy, and you can decide which browser to use.  They all work more smoothly in Win7.

* INSTALLATION, COMPATIBILITY: when you install programs, they will still install to each Vista and Win7, or (as usual) there will be glitches.  The reported glitches in the past, are largely and often solved by now:  initially, Vista and Win7 lacked drivers and needed the Service Packs.  But if you're buying either version now, manufacturers and software houses have long updated their drivers and programs, so you won't have as much hassle.  Even so, don't take any chances.  CLONE FIRST.  Then, do a clean install and reinstall your programs and files.

Compatibility is strange; I couldn't install Adobe 6, but could install MS Works 2006, in Vista or Win7.  Couldn't install MS 2002 or prior in Win7 on my Win7 Optiplex 780, but was able to install MS Office 2000 and 2002 on each of my Dell Win7 laptops (Lat 6530 and 6510, respectively).  So it's hit-or-miss. Google on your must-have programs to see if compatible with Win7.  Its compatibility advisor is useless.  You can still run DOS windows in Win7 (and in Win8 32-bit), but you won't be able to go full-screen, as you can still do in XP (even on 64-bit architecture, if the OS is 32-bit).

Programs most likely to be incompatible are:  Norton products which work in XP, any anti-virus or backup, anything which on installation, changes the right-click context menu in XP (will cause Win7 to crash).  For all such programs you need to buy the latest Win7-compatible version.  So that right there, may warrant you stay on XP.  No problem;  just learn to dual-boot with some flavor of Linux, and do your internetting from Linux, long term (after April 2014).  Use the XP for anything else.  Linux is no longer so hard, but there is a vocabulary to learn.  Better to learn the vocabulary and keep your mission-critical programs.  To save you headaches, the more-easily-learned Linux flavors are Mint 13 (not 14), Fedora 17 (not 18), and Zorin 6 Ultimate.

*  XP MAIL aka Outlook Express, is one of the incompatibles;  it's ruined in Vista and Windows 7, they gutted Outlook Express in favor of MAIL (Vista), then LIVE MAIL (Windows 7).  So you have no backwards-compatibility with OE, essentially.  If you ported your OE files into Vista MAIL, you lose them again in Win7, and lose them again in Win8.  Solution?  Get Thunderbird, but install it first on your XP machine, find out what file names the mailboxes become, then copy those files over to your Win7 machine after installing a second copy of Thunderbird to it again.  That way you keep the OE-like interface.  Thunderbird will not export, sad to say.

Alternately, export your OE files to Outlook, but in Win7 you might only be allowed to use Outlook 2003 et seq.  That's a problem, because MS Office 2003 gets a TON of very annoying updates;  one of them disables your ability to read older files, but they also derived a KB of two .reg patches you can download from MS to re-enable reading those files.  Point is, though, you have about a bizillion 'security' updates to the MS Office 2003 suite, so you'll have to put up with that.  Moreover, Win8 is compatible with Outlook (though it told me only from 2010 forward, others report Outlook 2003 worked fine in Win8).

EXCEPTION TO THE MAIL PROBLEM:  if you're accustomed to sending and composing email online already, then Windows Live Essentials may prove helpful for you.  Win8 has its own version of the same thing.  I find online email utterly annoying, and compose and receive all email to my email client, which is Outlook Express (or Outlook, which is more confusing but also more powerful).  So I don't have to remember each online email's own interface and commands (gmail versus Yahoo versus comcast, for example).  I just use OE, which is like Word.  So unless you are like me, you won't find Windows Live Mail in Win7, a loss.  You might even prefer it.  You will still have to change if you upgrade to Win8, but the change is just like Windows Live Essentials, a sort of consolidation of all your email sources to ONE, but still online.

* MEDIA CENTER and New version of MOVIEMAKER, which now can make 1080p HD videos.  Windows 7's default LIVE Essentials (including its own retarded version of moviemaker) is not useful.  By contrast, the freely-downloadable MS Windows Movie Maker 2.6 or 6.0 (latter allows HD, former is like old Moviemaker) is THE reason to upgrade to Vista or Win7.  See my 'Pixelan' topic in PC World for details and download links.  Moviemaker 6.0 is the best video editor I've ever used, and I make a ton of boring HD videos in Youtube.  Like its predecessor, it will go into a hang if you've insufficient RAM.  You really need 2 GB or more, preferably Core 2 Duo or i5, i7.  This is especially true, if you're remaking any Logitech webcam videos, since their bitrates are so high.  Try the 'Edge Detection' effect in Moviemaker 6.0, a kind of white embossing effect.  Can do wonders for face shots which didn't turn out okay, in the webcam.

You will lose Media Center and your DVD and Movie Maker in Win8, so don't upgrade to Win8 if you want the Media Center.

* MENUs, INTERFACE: if you're used to the classic menu and even in XP you used it, Vista beats Win7 there.  But you can tweak Win7 to get back most (but not all) of the classic 'experience', including how you organize and pin shortcuts to either Start Menu or taskbar.  One bad thing about the new Start Menu is you can't sort by name, and any additions you want go into specific sections of the left pane, with less ability to move them into other categories, versus the ease of XP.  You can unpin (delete) them from the Start Menu, or move them only within the section they occupy.  But you can still create any shortcut you want, put it on the desktop or the start menu.

*MENU THEMES default is Aero, which is classy (and is GPU intensive, not CPU intensive, so might actually speed up your clock), but again you can change themes back to what you used in XP.  What's neat here, is that since the old themes do occupy your CPU instead of your GPU (the dedicated memory on your graphics card), you can switch back and forth between Aero and classic themes at will, after you create them.  A tiled listing of your themes is kept, so it's a one-click change.  If you still use 'Plus!' from Win95, you can copy that entire folder into Program Files in either Vista or Win7, then run its theme.exe .  It won't wholly port over, but your sounds, pictures, font sizes etc. are all still customizable, so you can tweak it afterwards.  Saved me a ton of time.  Very much like XP, but in Win7 the themes are renamed themepack, so you can't just click on a .theme file and have it install.  Caveat: not all machines will work well if you use 'Plus!' theme.exe .  So backup your machine before trying it for the first time.

Two key settings in Windows 7 'personalize' (right-click while on the desktop) effectively turn Aero off and on: select Control Panel,  All Control Panel Items, Performance and Information Tools, then 'Adjust visual effects'. Then you see a dialogue box with 'Enable desktop composition', which if unchecked, turns off the Windows Color Aero effect, effectively returning it to default slate blue.

The other key setting in that same dialogue box, is 'use visual styles on windows and buttons'.  The latter, if unchecked, turns off Aero's glassy effect, makes your Start Menu opaque like Win98, but dual-column, like XP. DO SAVE your current theme before you uncheck it, as the change forces that ugly 'classic' grey interface from Win 3.1.  Then change the colors in Personalize, Windows Color, Advanced Appearance Settings, to access the XP-style dialogue box allowing you to change 3D Objects' colors and fonts, etc.  NOTE: if you later recheck 'visual styles', those colors you set are preserved in your programs.  So you can have a hybrid of the glassy and the colors.  It's nice, the hybrid.

IMPORTANT: the themes you save without Aero, don't convert well when you go back to Aero, the first time.  Windows doesn't fully 'remember' until you switch AGAIN to a non-Aero theme and then re-select an Aero theme.  So if switching back and forth from a non-Aero theme back to one in Aero, do the selection twice, to fully reflect the theme.

* MENU TOOLBARS: Sadly, you cannot use separate toolbars at top and bottom (or on the sides), but can aggregate as many toolbars as you create, in ONE place (top bottom left right).  If you use MS Office, use the Office Shortcut bar to create added toolbars you can place elsewhere (i.e., at the top of the screen).

You can use your old classic themes, even from back in the Win95 days.  There's a special trick to it in Win7, so again see my review in PC World (on 'Vista vs Win7'); I linked to a Windows 7 forum where that tweak is listed.  It's fast.

*  OS INTERFERENCE with computer program changes, housekeeping: Vista is an even bigger pain than XP, as Vista is way overly protective, the so-called 'User Account Control' function assumes you DO NOT have the right to change your software or your machine, even on such a little thing as FONTS.  Win7 on the FONTS problem is the same, but otherwise it only keeps on reminding you that you're making changes, and you can disable its annoying reminders to some extent, too.  So Win7 beats Vista there.  Win7 also beats Linux there, because Linux is even more anal about permissions than Windows 7.  (Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora will all prompt you for permissions as much or more, than Vista, so you have to type the root password each time;  the other Linux flavors either prevent you outright from a lot of normal functions, or make it too easy to screw up.  But Linux always puts a copy of itself in another section of the disk, so if you shut down afterwards, your screwup might not be preserved.)

* RAM -- Vista and Win7, like XP, operate much better if you have more RAM, but 2 GB works well, and 1GB is quite acceptable.  4GB is far better, and today's low RAM prices mean you should get that much RAM, if you can.

* REFRESH/RESTORE -- forget it.  MS never gets backup/refresh/restore correct, and the first week I had my Windows 7 machine it crashed.  Only way I could restore it was via Clonezilla, and that only because I cloned the drive with Macrium 5 Reflect Pro.  But you can buy Clonezilla's FULL backup/clone program right here in Amazon  (get the CD, not the USB stick).  So use Clonezilla instead.  NEVER USE WINDOWS TO BACK UP OR RESTORE WINDOWS.  Keep only one restore point, too.  Cloning is a LIVE COPY of your drive, and you can boot from it, as well as access any files without having to restore.  Daily, one hour a day or less, CLONE your machine. Or at least, use third-party incremental backup software, like Macrium.  I would never use the backup programs which come preinstalled on external hard drives from WD or Seagate, etc.  They all stink.  Just delete them.

* SEARCH is much better, in Win7, but is confusing to use, at first.  Click on the Start Menu and just start typing, if you don't want to look through what's there.  While you're typing, you'll see entries show up;  but when you hit ENTER, you get the full separate Search Screen you're used to seeing.

*  TWEAKING -- I highly recommend TuneUp Utilities with Windows, as there are a number of functions you'll want and need, which it can do to customize and improve your experience with the machine.  It is a kind of successor to Norton System Works, and I use it on all my XP machines.  See my reviews on it, here in Amazon.  It works with Windows 8 as well (2013 edition only, which you must download); but Win8 is the Hound from Hell, which I can't recommend to anyone.

Win7 will be around for a long time.  This product here, is the retail version, which means you can install and uninstall and reinstall as often as need be, on only one machine at a time.  Never get an OEM version:  the term means a copy sold to the firm manufacturing the hardware, and is specific TO that manufacturer;  so since you are not the manufacturer, count on it, your copy will be glitchy or won't work on the machine to which you install.

CAVEAT EMPTOR:  Be sure that whoever you're buying from, is selling you the RETAIL version, not OEM.  'System Builder' is a 'master' copy of the software, but it too can only be on one machine at a time.  RETAIL is best, as it's geared to an average person (versus SB, which is full of jargon and annoying to use.)

Did I miss something you wanted covered?  Yell at me.  I learn best by writing stuff out and answering questions, so am not adverse to questions, criticism with substance (rather than mere rants), etc.  Thank you for your time, and I hope this review helped!",3
"Let me explain what I mean.

I haven't used Quicken or any money management software sine the early days of Apple - Back when they were referred to as ""Macintoshes"" and were twice the price they are now.  Of course, they actually cost that amount to manufacture, unlike now.  But I digress.

Anyway, I've never used Microsoft Money or any other, so my review isn't skewed by a transition from one software to another, only the need to start organizing my various finances.  I already have a pretty good handle on things, but what I really needed was a birds-eye view of all of my due dates for my accounts in one interface.  I could always log them into Outlook tasks, but then I don't get the benefit of amounts that need to be paid, so I can plan in advance.

I could have used one of the various online management tools, but I have issues giving my bank account info to some online site especially if they don't give guarantees against security breaches that cost me money.  In any event, the offline app works better as I don't have to deal with timeouts and the like.  Unfortunately, Quicken Premier is absolutely NOT the application for me.  There are so many issues with the application that I don't really know where to start.  I will do my best to cover everything, and I will only focus on the negatives, because I think the positives would apply to any application, not just Quicken.

** What Quicken Premier Does WRONG **

- Most notable, Quicken Premier tries to help you by ""memorizing"" certain things.  You might consider this a benefit.  The problem is when it tries to memorize a replacement for a generic item.  For example, if you link your checking account and you have line items that say ""Debit Purchase"", for varying amounts, you obviously want to better categorize that name.  So you pick some transactions that are under $10 and assume they must be food.  You find those items and update the Category to Dining.  Now, I as a human being would expect such memorization to apply ONLY to the account I selected, NOT EVERY ACCOUNT.  Additionally, I would expect the software to be smart enough to realize that I did a search based on the dollar amount, so even if you apply it going forward, the same rule should apply (transactions less than $10 only).  That's not what Quicken does.  It just looks for any ""Debit Purchase"" and renames it, even if it didn't match your initial search criteria.  Why they would have this glaring oversight is beyond me.

- Second, Quicken is quite stupid when it comes to categorizing accounts.  I have four accounts at a particular bank, three checking and one credit line.  Quicken picked up my main checking and my outflow account with little issue, but it logged the inflow account (checking) as a credit card.  It logged my credit line as a checking account.  Even though my credit line is called ""LINE OF CREDIT"".  Yeah, okay.  Incidentally, the inflow account listed payments as charges and charges as payments (a whole other issue, BTW).  What a nightmare.

- Third, Quicken allows you to create linked transactions between disparate accounts.  This is all well and good, except it's not smart enough to go out and simply find the opposite transaction on its own.  What it does instead is add another line item for the opposite transaction, skewing your balance sheet.  So for example, of my accounts listed above, I have a somewhat linear transfer path: inflow to primary, primary to outflow, primary to line of credit, line of credit to primary.  I see a debit transaction in the inflow that is definitely an instance where I transferred funds to the primary account.  So I set the category as a transfer, and note the account it went to.  I would expect Quicken to go out, search for an identical, opposite amount transaction in the linked account, and simply create the bond, because obviously if I transferred money from account A to account B, I should have an inbound credit in account B.  That's logical right?  It doesn't do that.  Instead, it creates a duplicate line item.  So when I went through and added transfer categories on my accounts, it screwed all of my balance sheets up to heights you wouldn't believe.

- Fourth, Quicken does not allow you to set the method of reconciliation or download.  Meaning, I don't want to manually edit transactions in my checking accounts or my line of credit; that's why I linked it to the banks in the first place.  I want Quicken to use the bank's response file as the be-all-end-all source of correct information.  I don't want it to accept any manual changes to any amounts or transactions, because obviously the bank record is correct.  Unfortunately, once you download the transactions the first time, Quicken is more than content to allow you to modify the line items, which is fine...but I'd like an option to disable this.

- Fifth, Quicken apparently has no way to link out and just grab ADP or Paychex data from the databases, even though both have the capability of feeding this data (since various tax programs can do it, including I believe Intuit's own TurboTax Deluxe).  Filling in payroll information is corny, do you know why?  My check is never the same.  I might have overtime, I might have sick time, I might have a bonus, I might have extra fees, my medical might have gone up or down, I might have worked less hours, etc.  It's not a valid thing to have to do.

- Sixth, and speaking of payroll, Quicken does not allow you to distinguish percentage-calculated amounts versus fixed amounts.  In other words, we know that a person is charged federal tax at a percentage, referred to as a tax bracket.  That means it needs to be calculated based on the amount of reported income on the check.  Quicken does not allow you to set a percentage...you have to enter a fixed amount, which won't apply if your check changes.  I have no idea why this is, considering, again, TurboTax Deluxe has no problem with this.  In fact, TurboTax will even calculate what your bracket is and calculate the correct tax based on your total YTD.  Why does Quicken Premier lack this functionality, given its primary selling point is the ability to help you plan for tax time?  Yes, I know, two different programs for two different purposes.  But financial planning includes the ability to manage exactly how much tax you're paying and expected to pay.

- Seventh, Quicken will not pull ""today"" data, even if said data was entered the day prior.  So for example, my bank is on the east coast and works on that time.  If I enter a transaction after 9pm my time, it gets credited to the next business day in my transactions.  That's fine, but it wreaks havoc in Quicken, because Quicken will not show those transactions, yet it will pull the actual total balance as if the transactions were there.  One or the other, Intuit - either you credit ALL transactions regardless of date, as they show in my web account, and show the correct balance, or you reflect the balance and transactions as they stood the day prior.  Now maybe my bank is part to blame for that with their file exports.  But I still lay blame on Quicken for not hashing this out with banks in different time zones.

Some other things I note:

- The interface is dog ugly.  It's a giant spreadsheet, essentially.  I seem to remember it always being like this, but I would have hoped that it would have been improved by now.

- You can't sort by downloaded vs. non-downloaded transactions.  Otherwise I could have cleared out the junk it put in there on its own and been left with the downloaded transactions which I know to be correct.

- No built-in Bill Pay.  Instead, you are directed to sign up for a $10/month subscription to do this.  Now maybe this Bill Pay is the greatest thing since sliced bread and I just don't know what I'm missing.  But my bank already affords me the ability to do bill pay, faster, and free.  Therefore, I see no value in doing this except the remote possibility they have electronic payments for accounts that my bank doesn't - something I would not pay money for.

- No ability to pull bill data from utilities.  Wells Fargo's Online service has this ability, so I know it's possible.  Maybe they did something specific over there, but I'm quite shocked that Quicken is not on the ball here.

- No ability to just delete everything and tell it to re-download from scratch.  No idea why this is missing.

Can I recommend it?  No.  It's trying too hard to make things easy.  When you just want accuracy, this tool fails horribly.  As a manual management tool, it probably would shine, but in that case you could fire up Excel, download a template and get it done much faster.  For the price this is being offered at, I simply cannot recommend buying it.  Also, if you do end up buying it, I strongly recommend you opt for the physical copy rather than the digital download.  Physical copy has Amazon's return policy plus Intuit's satisfaction guarantee beyond the 30 day from Amazon.  Digital copy has NO return capability no matter what.  This is clearly stated in Amazon's digital download terms.  Buyer Beware.",3
"Better than anything else out there in my opinion, including Adobe's completely overly complex and overpriced products.  The interface is simple, good-looking, and even fun.  This is the kind of hobby software you wish for.

Know that if you are going to be editing HD movies, have the hottest quad processor and as much RAM as you can manage.  I've got an AMD quad clocked to 4GHz, 8GB of RAM, and dual nVidia 9600s in SLI, which easily handles everything I throw at it, including high-power games that make PS3 and XBox consoles look and feel like cheap smartphones.  But when I edit HD, it gives my machine a serious workout.  Thankfully, VSX4 has a brilliant way to relax this if you need it by way of using proxy files.

Also know that this software, as great as it is, is several products combined.  For example, DVD MovieFactory is no longer bundled with the software - they actually incorporated it right into the software (they didn't even change the menus one single bit).

Thank heavens, the crashy bugs are largely worked out now.  I have yet to have this software crash on me.  Also has some really super fun playtoy things to amuse yourself with, like 3D, time lapse, and stop-motion, which work surprisingly well, allowing you to make up for any features your camcorder may not have built-in.  This kind of software can take the drudgery out of video editing and actually turn a chore into a hobby.  I am now having just as much fun (if not more) editing my video as I previously did watching it.

Rendering times could have been MUCH better in this software, the result of 32-bit software.  VSX4 just doesn't work my machine very hard.  If it was 64-bit, it would be a dream.

Converting 2D video to 3D is the only ""candy"" feature I have played with.  Not spectacular, but it works and adds some fun depth to some otherwise boring video (3D depth is adjustable).  Fun to toy around with but not take too seriously.  If it wasn't shot in 3D from the beginning, don't expect much from a 2D to 3D conversion in terms of what you see in the movie theaters.  If you don't try to take it too seriously, you'll have some fun with it (and maybe a few headaches from the red/blue glasses).  VSX4 DOES support side-by-side color 3D, which requires special video hardware to watch, like a 3D TV and the shutter glasses.  My gear arrives next week, so I'll play around with it some more, really looking forward to full-color side-by-side 3D.  It's like Christmas.

Something that I absolutely LOVE about this software that needs to be mentioned that PowerDirector doesn't have:  being able to add/remove DVD/Blu-ray chapter marker points right on the timeline as you edit.  Then, when you finally get around to opening up the ""Share"" section of the program, which allows you to build the menus for your DVDs and Blu-Rays (and do the burn), your chapter markers are already there, and all you have to do is worry about the visuals of the menus themselves - the chapter marker work you did on the timeline itself is already done and saved.  NICE.  Even better, you can do more chapter marker editing while in the menu creation process in case you missed anything.  NICER.

Another thing I love is the WYSIWYG preview/work window you're using to work on your video.  It is playing working in high res HD - not the heavily pixelated version of the video you see in PowerDirector.  PD9 probably has a function somewhere to enable HD viewing/working, but VSX4 comes up that way as default.  Note that viewing/editing in HD slows the software down quite painfully - looks nice but this is where the 32bit aspect of the software really comes back to bite you hard, severely, and non-stop.

Highly recommended.  With all the bugs of previous versions, the software was virtually worthless - it was as ""crash-happy"" as PowerDirector.  Now it's actually worth paying for.  4 out of 5 stars because, well, Adobe Production Suite CS5 it ain't.

* UPDATE *

After finally getting around to moving on to creating Blue-Rays from DVDs, I have some new information, both good and bad.

The Good:

This software is solid as a rock.  It NEVER crashes.  I have never lost any work due to a crash, and it performs reliably no matter how badly it chokes on what I feed it.

The Bad:

Performance:  It chokes on what I feed it.  Working with HD video brings this 32-bit software to its knees.  It does not bring your computer to its knees - just the VSX4 software itself.  Yeah, I know, I can throw it into proxy mode AS A BAND-AID DUE TO LIMITATIONS OF THIS 32-BIT SOFTWARE, but with a system like mine, that shouldn't even have to be considered.  VSX4 is VERY sluggish when working with HD.  It won't crash on you, but you'll be continually waiting (after hitting playback buttons, dragging jog bars, working with effects and transitions, mode shifts, etc) for the software to catch up to itself as it chews hard on any HD video you feed it.  I spend a LOT of time stopping preview/playback, which collapses into ""slideshows"",  so I can wait for this software to ""catch up"" to itself before resuming a smooth playback.  This collapse into jerky slideshow playback happens whenever adding transitions, effects, etc.  LOTS of lagging going on.  This is the worse experience I have ever had on my custom-built 4GHz 64-bit Quad (8GM ram, 2 TB drive space).  It is the only software on my system that totally fails at using the raw horsepower available on my system.  All 4 processors are being used, but only in 32-bit mode - the software is not capable of using the 64-bit power of my system, which leaves virtually half the resources of my system unused as it chokes and stutters on HD. I should NOT be forced to throw the software into proxy mode when I'm running solid 64-bit OS on 64-bit hardware.  Corel - 32-bit is now an albatross around your neck.  It was time long ago to crank this product out in 64-bit.  PD9 might crash endlessly and have the worst tech support on the planet, but you're still getting clobbered by it just because it's 64 bit.  Even I went and paid for PD9 Ultra64 - it's that important.

Next Problem - Menus:  When editing the menus, your changes are not saved.  MAJOR bug.  A progress bar goes across the screen, but when you go to open your project back up, whaddya know - all your DVD/Blu-Ray disc menu work is gone.  Didn't save. This is a long-standing bug in the DVD MovieFactory 7 software that Corel integrated into VideoStudio for the X4 version.  I have to wonder if anybody even did the most simple of testing at Corel.  Was surprised to see this glaring bug carry over.

Next Problem:  Sound Stuttering:  The Blu-Ray discs this software cranks out are visually beautiful, excellent quality, virtually no noticeable drop in quality from source to output whatsoever.  But if you don't use transitions between video segments, there are sound gaps between scenes.  These are skips in the sound, like the software was choking during conversion or someone hitting ""mute"" for a fraction of a second on every scene change (and the sound from the next scene, when it finally kicks in, jolts you into annoyance).  I am still investigating if this is actually on the Blu-Ray discs VSX4 is cranking out or if it is how my PS3 is playing the Blu-Rays (never seen my PS3 do that with any other discs).  However, there has also been a couple of instances where I noticed some very noticeable sound slippage (people's mouths are sometimes not moving in sync when you hear them speaking or other sounds not matching the action on screen).  The slippage seems to be random, and also seems to happen only once in a while, and for short periods that last only a minute or so, but the sound stutter between scene changes are constant and reliably annoying.  Sound slippage was a very annoying bug carried over from DVD MovieFactory 7.  In fairness, ALL video production products can exhibit sound slippage, so I'm not specifically pointing at Corel on this one.  But the jolting sound gaps between scenes with no transition effects are horrible.  I have resorted to using transitions as a band-aid to keep this from happening(!) when creating Blu-Ray discs.  Being the novice videographer that I am, even I know that's bad.

Another problem:  The menus, transitions and most of the effects are extremely limited.  Even after adding the ""bonus pack"" and ""content pack"", you wind up with only about a dozen DVD menu template options and only 8 Blu-Ray menu options.  And most of the menu choices are ridiculously childish - certainly nothing you'd use if you are attempting to take your video work seriously in any way.  I still have yet to find good instructions on building my own Blu-Ray menu templates.  I hear about it, but have found no instructions.  I guess I just have to use the Force.

One final nitpick:  Downloadables/online content.  Sorry, Corel, but CyberLink's got you nailed on this one.  VSX4 is a fantastic product, if not a bit TOO simplistic, but it pales in comparison to the universe of PowerDirector's online/downloadable content.  One thing that VSX4 has going for it that CyberLink needs to pay attention to is that VSX4 does not insult you every step of the way by forcing you to ""Register"" or ""Activate"" different functions of the software as you actually go into the software to use it.  Well done, Corel, for showing CyberLink how it's done and for not treating your customes like criminals (why you got my money).

As as I wind down, I'll just offer that my ultra-hot 64-bit quad processor, 8GB of ram, and 2TB of SATA drive space should have no problem whatsoever cranking out a high quality product with this software.  So far I'm happy with most everything in the whole, and I continue to use the product.  But I'm dropping this now $65 product (about what I paid on Corel's web site) down to 2 Stars because of megasuck performance, menu issues, and sound quality issues on Blu-Ray discs.

HOWEVER:

Tech Support:  Corel's tech support is fantastic (listen up, CyberLink victims):  I get responses from Corel's web/email tech support within 12 hours like clockwork, and they are helpful.  They even ask me if I need any more assistance after they answer my questions or point me in the right direction.  Their online tech support forum is great, very helpful.  During regular business hours, I have called Corel's phone support and get a live person every time, speaking clear English, with very helpful information and my issues get solved.  Hear that, CyberLink? Corel customers aren't treated like thieves, pirates or criminals, and Corel doesn't make you provide 5 different pieces of evidence that the customer actually paid for the software, only to be denied service anyway - which is what CyberLink does.  Never have I seen a company treat its own customers (paycheck) so poorly as CyberLink.  Corel - well done.

In light of Corel's excellent and responsive tech support, both through email, the support forum, and on the phone(!), which I have consistently had great service from, and for the fact that the software just does not crash anymore (wow!), I'm jacking this review back up to 3 stars.

I am, Corel, giving you 3 stars because I am assuming that you are going to address the issues above.

Thanks for tolerating this review.

------------UPDATE---2012-06-24------------------------
Recently the software has been hanging, and badly.  It seems that whenever I start moving around in the software, the software just hangs, and ""Not Responding"" is displayed in the top title bar.  Service Pack 1 did not fix the problem.  It's never done this to me before, but now does it pretty much non-stop.  It takes anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes for VideoStudio to recover from this problem and unfreeze so I can continue - only to see it lock up yet again.  But even when I finally stumble through to the burn process, now it won't burn any Blu-Ray I'm working on - it comes up with an error 2 hours into the disc creation process, and that's not even getting to the burn part yet.  VERY frustrating. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, to no avail.  Even worse - I upgraded to VideoStudio X5 and it's doing the same exact lockup/freeze thing.  And as much as I hate to say it, I was also shocked to see that Video Studio X5 is STILL 32-bit!  HUH?!?  As such, I'm getting ready to tuck my tail between my legs and shift over to 64-Bit PowerDirector 10 if I can't get this working.  I can't believe it's come to this.  VideoStudio produces noticeably better quality output than PowerDirector, which is why I'm using this product (the reason for this is that VSX drops 60fps video down to 30fps video while maintaining a high 24mb bitate so it doesn't have to compress it into a bunch of pixelated mush like PowerDirector does).  But if I can't use the product, then I can't use the product.  Period.  Sorry, but I've got to kick the stars down to 2 at this point due to being still 32-bit (this is 2012!) and the recent lockup issues with both VSX4 and VSX5.  Too bad, I really like this software due to quality of it's actual output, which is better than any other product.  But I just might have to move on now.

-----------------------Another update-------------------
I have discovered the cause of the problem.  I discovered that two of the video clips that I was trying to work into a video sequence were corrupt files.  VSX was chokig on it, this is what caused the lockups.  Sadly, I was not able to complete my project with VSX.  Even sadder was having to use CyberLink's PowerDirector, which was able to work with the corrupted files without any problems.  Ouch.  Ok, Corel,  back up to 3 stars again because the corrupted video files were my fault.  But again - PD10 was able to use my files and VSX wasn't.  I repeat - Ouch.",3
"I obtained a $15 upgrade license to Windows 8 Pro more than a year ago, when I purchased my desktop computer.  I was one of the early adopters of Windows 8, but immediately regretted it due to major incompatibility and usability problems, so I went and reverted back to Windows 7.  At that time, I felt it was too early to write a fair review.  I mean, for me it was a major screw up from Microsoft, but I also felt that MS had a point in producing a touch-screen oriented OS, and that I should probably wait and see if this actually was the way to go in the near future.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt and stood down from blasting them with a negative review.
A year later comes Windows 8.1, claiming adjustments were implemented for the non-touch-screen user base, in an attempt to convince more people into adopting their new OS platform.
Windows 8.1 is free for Windows 8 users, so I decided to give it another chance.  I figured, why waste all of $15 dollars on a new OS and not take advantage of this redeeming opportunity? So here's how it went.

Upgrade process:

*** Edit: Forgot to mention the upgrade path for Windows 8.1.  You upgrade from Windows 7, to Windows 8, from 32 bit to 32 bit and 64 bit to 64 bit.  Going from 32 to 64 bit requires a full/fresh install (it wipes documents, programs, etc.), not an upgrade.  Also, you can't upgrade from Win 7 64-bit to Win 8 32-bit.  Once you upgrade to Windows 8, you can upgrade to 8.1 by downloading the point release in the Microsoft Store, available as a tile icon on the Windows 8 new Metro desktop.  The 8.1 download will be available only after you have applied all critical Windows 8 post-upgrade fixes.  It may take a few restarts until you get all Windows 8 updates.  If you plan to update directly from Win 7 to Win 8.1, you will require a full/fresh install, it is also not part of the upgrade path.  end Edit ***

Upgrade assistant displayed a report with potential application compatibility issues.
Not all of the installed applications are scanned during this process, only those apps that Microsoft has registered on their database.  You have to cross your fingers for other applications on your system to work with Windows 8.1.  I suggest some investigative work prior to committing to the upgrade process, especially if one of those unreported apps is considered critical for you.
The initial stages of the upgrade show you the incompatible applications and drivers for Windows 8.  This was scary at first, because one of the apps was the actual antivirus software, which ironically is their own MS Security Essentials. The actual reason for the message is that Windows 8 includes its own AV software integrated with the OS called Windows Defender. Security Essentials is now a pre Windows 8 product.
The other two incompatible applications were the Blue Tooth and USB 3.0 controllers.  Later after the upgrade I found out that these were actually replaced with Windows 8.1 versions, but this is not clearly explained during the upgrade; at that point they were just incompatible, okay? You figure it out.  It felt a little uncomfortable, sitting in front of your screen contemplating whether these incompatibilities will impact your upgrade or not.  I could imagine a non-technical user hitting Esc or Cancel immediately after seeing this.  I saw this as a challenge, I dared Windows 8.1 to mess with my working Windows 7 setup, so I followed their directions to uninstall Security Essentials and the USB and Bluetooth drivers and continue faithfully (blindly)with the process.  After that, a Steam game was reported as incompatible and two others required patches supposedly available from their developers.  Fortunately in this case, all the games worked fine after the upgrade was completed (with all Windows updates applied).
The actual upgrade took approximately two hours or so (including the initial download).  It actually took longer to apply the Windows updates after the actual upgrade.  In total, it took approximately 3.5 hrs to finish the entire upgrade, and most of this time was spent ""watching paint dry"".

Post upgrade issues (One major and one minor issue):

Major issue - Higher than normal CPU usage with and idle computer and abnormally high CPU temperatures (55C - 60C).  After some investigation, it was an Intel Storage Controller driver compatibility issue.  Replacing the Windows driver with the PC manufacturer's version made this issue go away.  If it wasn't for a small CPU temperature app (Speed Fan) I wouldn't have discovered the problem with who knows what future consequences.

Minor issue - A third party app that was not displayed on the Windows compatibility report, no longer works with Windows 8.1.  It was not a big deal for me because the software developer has not upgraded this software for almost two years now anyway (DarkBasic Pro).

Personal gripes:

- The new Metro interface - It's designed for touch screen devices, I have a Desktop.  Isn't it possible to write a piece of code to detect whether or not you have a touch screen device and adjust the Metro desktop accordingly?

- Windows button - It's there, but it does not work as I believe many of us were expecting it to work, to give us the familiar Start menu with All Programs.  You still have to use the metro interface to search or browse for your programs.  You'll have to get used to it.  On the positive side, the shortcut to common system options when you right click the Windows icons is a nice plus.

- File History - There is no Backup and Restore anymore.  It seems that with every Windows upgrade, a key functionality is removed from this important component.  From XP to Win 7 you lost the ability to backup to network drives, unless you purchased the Ultimate edition. Windows 8.1 replaced Backup and Restore with File History, which is limited to backing up files located in Documents, Music, Video, Desktop and Pictures folders.  You are no longer able to customize the backup to save files from other folder on your computer.  You will have to relocate folders into any of the valid backup folders.  It still saves backups on external drives only.  Shared drives or even Sky Drive are not backup options.
The automated backup occurs a few times during the day.  You can backup on demand, but have no control of the automated backup frequency.  The backup format is different than the format used in Windows 7.  If you used to have a backup in Windows 7 format, now you have two different sets of backups on the same drive.

- Minor gripe, it feels redundant having application shortcuts on your regular Desktop and your Metro desktop.

Pluses

- The Sports tile - It's nice to have an option to select favorite team news. The results, standings, and stats information is always up to date and quickly available.
- The News tile was awesome until it stopped working...
- In Metro, the option to search programs organized by most commonly used is very convenient
- I still have my Desktop and shortcuts.
- Windows boots a little faster and it handles CPU cycles very well.  Components are running cool and efficient.

Current issues

- News tile opens and closes and does not display news.  Currently I can't read news, although I can see the headline updates on the actual tile icon.

- The lock screen actually lives up to its name.  After a while of inactivity (haven't nailed the actual time it takes before the system locks up), the lock screen remains there and you can't get past it to the logon.  The mouse cursor icon moves, and the keyboard is responding (can see Caps lock light switching on and off) but it's not possible to get to the actual log on screen. Windows does not respond to Ctrl-Alt-Del, esc keys, mouse clicks, space bar or any key combination. The only solution is to power down, and then be greeted with a message that the computer did not shutdown cleanly during power up.

- Sky Drive - Stopped working the first day after I cancelled a large file upload.  There's an error message, but no option to resolve the issue.  The message shows up every time I open Sky drive, and have not been able to delete or add any more files ever since, and the message cannot be deleted. The only way to use Sky Drive is by using the ol' regular web browser method.

- File Search - For some reason it takes forever to open .jpg files directly from the search results, no matter how small the file size is.  You have to select the option to open file location and then click on the file within File Explorer to get a quick response.  This issue does not happen with videos, Word documents, or PDFs.

Conclusion
- It will probably take some time to get all the issues corrected. In my case, they are not really critical issues, but they are nonetheless annoying and make you feel like
Microsoft again gave more importance to general compatibility than to stability and usability.

- It still seems to me that Microsoft is still insisting on forcing people to adopt the touch screen technologies with the Metro interface.  I insist it's still too early for that and Microsoft should adjust their OS's to accommodate to their user demands not the other way around.

- It was a rocky start, but I'm okay with the current application compatibility.  As long as I can play my Steam games and use my personal finance apps, I'm a happy camper.
It's a keeper, for now just because I feel too lazy to go through a factory reset back to Windows 7.  Three stars for now.  I'll keep you posted...",3
"2/2 update.  I'm still okay with the Win 8 desktop mode but I'm now officially in the hate camp on the metro, New Windows Interface, or whatever that rubbish is called.  Before anyone gives me grief, hear me out.  I've given metro more than enough chances to win me over.  I just can no longer take this Frankenstein version of Windows trying to be all things to all people, tablet and PC.  It's a gimmick and one with irritating repercussions.  Take a recent email for example.  I had to send an immediate response to someone with attachments.  I replied in Windows mail (since it was conveniently there), went to insert attachments and found there was no way to do so.  I did my usual edge of the screen mouse hovering and saw everything from charms, to running programs, to the metro option, but nothing for attachments.  I had to back out of mail and search the web for the answer.  I learned I have to right-click an empty area of the message to bring up a sub-menu on the bottom (not even the normal context menu) that has more options, including inserting attachments.  If I had a touchscreen, all I would have needed to do was swipe.  Therein lies the problem.  Microsoft spent so much time catering to the tablet and touch crowd, they ruined a lot of the traditional desktop functionality in this mode.  What was previously a fast paced mouse clicking, keyboard shortcut typing paradise has been turned into a mess.  I really wish they gave us the option to choose between whether or not we want all that touch garbage installed at all.  I definitely would keep it off my PC and save the space.  It's just not worth the aggravation.  Sure, it's cutesy and all, with it's colorful tiles and live content, but navigation, usability, and usefulness are minimal.  I live in the desktop environment and that's all I want.  So to that end, I'll be going back to Windows 7 for as long as Microsoft supports it.  Just in case this is the new permanent mindset of Microsoft, I invested in a backup.  After being primarily a Windows user for over twenty years, I bought my first MacBook this past fall.  I'd tinkered with OSX and Linux here and there and even own an older iMac, but after trying the release previews of Windows 8 extensively, I figured if I had to learn a radically different OS design, I may as well make the switch to the least radically changed OS. Looks like my gamble paid off.  I am neither an Apple lover (because believe me, they have their issues too), nor a Microsoft lover but I definitely have to agree with Tim Cook's quote, a spot-on assessment of Windows 8:  ""I suppose you could design a car that flies and floats, but I don't think it would do all of those things very well.""  In trying to compete with both the iPad and iMac in one swoop, Windows gave up their biggest advantage.  This can only help Linux and OSX.

That sums up my feelings of Windows 8 exactly. It tries to be a tablet and traditional PC combined but the end result is not very good.  I also wanted to point out, in my initial review I spoke of boot times and claims of incredibly fast boot times from people.  Well, I've recently started experiencing these short boot times myself and discovered it's because Microsoft has implemented a new shut-down scheme.  It's not really a ""shutdown"" in the traditional sense but more like an advanced hibernation mode.  I didn't initially experience these superfast boots but have been noticing them more and more lately.  I'm assuming it's because I'm no longer installing programs and other tasks that extend my boots/reboots.  At first, I thought I was somehow accidentally selecting sleep instead of shutdown.  I checked my event viewer and saw that it never mentions shutdown anymore, only sleep regardless of whether I select ""power off"".  I knew something was up, so I did a little digging and found info about the new boot mode.  There are parameters you can use to perform a true shutdown but once again, MS is forcing a PC to behave like a tablet.  I already have a tablet, so Windows 8 is not really necessary.  My advice, if you have a traditional PC and you're happy with Windows 7, stick with it.  If you primarily use your PC for web browsing, playing games and social activity, then Windows 8 isn't a bad choice, but if you're a power user and use your PC in a more traditional manner, you're likely not going to like it.  By the way, I'm STILL missing a couple drivers.  Last time that happened was Windows Vista.  That brought an interesting thought to mind; see if you recognize the pattern:  Windows 95/98, Windows ME, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8.  Notice a trend?  Long time Windows users will notice immediately.
--------------------------------------------------------------

I'm, in the camp with those who neither love nor hate Windows 8.  I decided to upgrade after holding onto my copy of Windows 8 for over two months.  I bought it on Black Friday and just couldn't convince myself to install it, based on my last experience with the final preview version.  Well, I recently discovered that if you don't download and install the Media Center before January 31st, it would no longer be free and you would have to pony up an additional $20 for the ability to download it and have the capability to play DVDs and such.  So, I installed this past weekend and have been playing around with it since.  So far, my feelings about it are mixed.  I do feel that the uproar over metro (the purists will have to forgive me for calling it that, but it has no real distinguishing name, so it will be metro for this review) vs the desktop is much ado about nothing.  I spend 90% of my time in the desktop and have no problem getting there via the big ""desktop"" button on the metro screen or hitting the Start+B buttons.  The start menu is also overblown.  Yes, I was pretty upset at how Microsoft initially hid the programs and all the steps I had to take to get to them, however, once I figured out how to use charms, navigation became as quick and easy as it was with the Start menu.  Also, just to avoid any confusion, the taskbar is still there.  Yes, the date/time and little icons are all still on the right and your quick-launch shortcuts are still on the left.  Only the Start menu is missing.  Although I'm no fan of the metro interface, it does have its moments.  I like seeing mail, calendar, and other events in real-time live tiles.  Comparing the traditional desktop to metro is like the difference between iOS and Android.  Although metro is useful at times, I'd still prefer the choice to not use it so much.  Speaking of live tiles, that's another concern of mine, security.  From what I've read and heard, be very careful what content you put on the computer, especially photos.  I'm honestly leery about placing any photos or other super sensitive info on my PC now that Windows is so cloud-centric.  It's one thing to know that yes, there is a possibility your system could get compromised and your data illegally stolen; It's quite another when your computer is knowingly advertising your content.  My biggest likes of Windows 8 are increased functionality, better security, SOME features of IE 10, like spell-check (welcome to the 21st century, finally IE...), the mail and calendar integration (No Outlook necessary!) and the live tiles.  Another plus is that you don't ""need"" a touchscreen to navigate either interface.  I find navigating with the mouse to be relatively easy and think I'd prefer it even if I did have a touchscreen, other than the hot spots I'll address in the next paragraph.  So, that's pretty much it for now in the like column.

On the flip side, my list of dislikes is quite lengthy.  First, despite running the Windows Upgrade Advisor and being told many programs and drivers were compatible, many were not.  The funny thing is, Windows installed native drivers for devices it claimed needed updating and did not have native drivers for others it claimed were compatible.  After a lot of searching high and low, I found almost all of the drivers but I'm still missing one driver.  Several of my ""compatible"" programs either wouldn't run properly or wouldn't install at all, despite being listed as compatible in the WUA.  My second gripe is with the navigation.  Although you get accustomed to it, some long time Windows users will be pretty miffed at the changes because most are counterintuitive. Quirky requirements like hovering over random edges of the screen to bring up menus and the lack of traditional navigation options.  Also, some features that should be pretty straightforward take a little detective work to figure out, like how to add additional accounts after mail is set up or how to close metro apps like mail, calendar or even the metro version of IE, which is noticeably different from the desktop version.  They also took away some ease of use such as advance settings in networking.  They made it pretty much like a tablet to configure networking. Speaking of tablets, the merge of desktop and metro touch-oriented OS is a little convoluted.  For instance, there are apps that will only work in one or the other.  An example of this is an application I own that I've used in Windows for over a decade.  Well, they also now offer an app store version.  My desktop version only runs in the desktop mode (even if launched from the metro interface) and the app store version only runs in the metro interface, leading me to believe that the app store version (along with many other apps are really geared toward tablets).  If you thought distinguishing phone from tablet apps was hard in Android, wait until you have fun trying to figure out which apps are geared toward tablets versus PCs in the Windows App Store.  Although this is the last complaint I'll type, the list goes on.  My final complaint is the installation process.  Technically, for an upgrade, you must have a previous version of Windows already installed.  I installed on a clean wiped system (my preference always) and was unable to activate Windows after installation.  I called Microsoft and a nice gentleman assisted me with getting it activated via an alternative method.  I hope Microsoft intends to change this in the future because I do not wish to install a prior OS every time I need to rebuild, nor do I trust their ""erase everything and reinstall Windows"" option because if a nasty enough piece of malware hits you, I don't think any part of your disk is guaranteed safe, even hidden restore partitions.

Overall, I don't regret the upgrade but had I not been pressed into upgrading now or losing the free media center, I likely would have stuck with Windows 7 for the foreseeable future.  I haven't personally observed any of the claimed performance gains nor any of the alleged sub-ten-second boot times, although I think the fast booters were booting from sleep mode and not a full power down.  Despite the aforementioned software and driver issues, I have not yet experienced any stability issues but I also haven't really stressed the system yet with some hardcore encoding or gaming.  Once I've had a chance to work out the kinks and truly test the OS, I'll be certain to report any and all issues encountered.",3
"The ""System Builder"" discs of Windows 8 are named this way because they are a full install and not an upgrade.  The assumption is that you are building your own machine and looking to put Windows 8 on a from-scratch install, but this is still a multi-boot friendly OS and if your intention instead is to install a full copy of Windows 8 without upgrading your current system, well, that works too:  you can put this on old hardware so long as your machine meets the system requirements.  There has been some confusion at the lack of an 'OEM' SKU for Windows, so I suspect that until we hear otherwise, this is our 'OEM' substitute for those of us who like to tinker with hardware.

If you're considering Windows 8, there are benefits many small and large. The patchwork way in which the OS seems to meld old into new can be confusing, and it's clear the UI pays lip service to mice while eagerly awaiting your first touch-screen or touch-pad purchase. But to give credit where credit is due, there are benefits under the surface to go with the drawbacks you see before your eyes. Putting Windows 8 Pro on a new system is a good hedge against longevity, but will require experienced Windows 7 (and below) users to be patient with the newer parts of the UI.

This version of Windows 8 is different from Windows 8 Pro in that it does not allow you to use Remote Desktop or BitLocker hard drive encryption, nor can you join the machine to an Active Directory Domain.  There are several native Windows 8 apps included with all versions of Windows 8:  News, Stocks, Weather, Pictures, E-mail, Music, Xbox integration (to your XBox account, to view your stats or stream content to/from your PC), and Facebook.  There is also support for Windows SkyDrive and a Windows Live account, to the point that your PC's user account can be fully integrated with your Windows Live account if that is what you wish.  While Windows Media Center is listed as requiring a separate license, right now Microsoft is offering that license for free on the Windows 8 website (Amazon won't let me put external links here or I would).

The biggest change in Windows 8 is that the Start Menu that we have had since Windows 95 is no longer a menu. It is a full-screen splash of square tiles instead of icons, which vary in width from one to two tiles wide. Some of this makes sense in that some of today's programs are more like the Windows Desktop Gadgets we've seen in Vista and 7: they sit idle, stream information and need to be big enough to be readable. Although this is the biggest visual change, if you've used Windows Media Center, Office 2010, or an XBox 360, you've already been interacting with similar interfaces. This sort of UI has been slowly making its way into Microsoft's products for a while now.

That said, the transition from the familiar Start Menu to the full-screen splash takes some getting used to. It may take some arranging to get the tiles laid out conveniently, but Microsoft makes this easy to do. The rest of the Windows 8 OS spends its time hopping between the old and the new look. The desktop looks exactly like it did in Windows 7 and Vista, except there's no Start Button: you're expected to press the Windows key or move your mouse to the bottom corner of the screen to launch the tile dashboard.  The desktop looks exactly as it did in 7, only without the Start Button. All programs can be launched directly off the tile screen, and while Windows 8 apps run one at a time in a full-screen view, older programs run from within the Desktop and can be resized. We have a version of Internet Explorer 10 accessible from the desktop that looks just like IE 9 did in Windows 7, then we have a version of Internet Explorer 10 in the tile screen that looks entirely different.  Windows 8 applications don't really ""close"" any more:  when you leave an application, it just disappears from view, like a smartphone OS would do. Some parts of the Control Panel have the tile look and feel and the options cascade left-to-right like the Home screen in Office 2010. Other parts of the Control Panel look exactly like they did in Windows 7 and before.

Windows 8 may appear to be a patchwork of old and new, but there's more going on under the covers. In earlier versions of Windows, the number of programs running in the background could get unwieldy and slow things down. There was a shift to rely more on Services, which are listeners that sit idle waiting to launch programs only when needed. Windows 7 started to get bogged down with a lot of running Services though, and so Microsoft have stripped several services out of Windows 8, which means Windows 8 runs more efficiently than Windows 7. Any machine that can run 7 can run 8 (and I remember installing 7 on some pretty old hardware!).

Where older versions of Windows would have to re-launch a program every time it is opened, in Windows 8 anything not being used by you is set aside and the resources it used handed back to the OS for other work.  Programs respond much faster on relaunch due to having been left in this standby mode. The Windows Vista and 7 ""Aero effects"" that gave your windows a glassy sheen and rounded corners used graphics and CPU to run, so they've been stripped out in favor of simple color schemes, a bit of glassiness at the Desktop, and blocky corners. Interaction with Windows in the Tile UI is easier if you have a touchscreen or you're using a tablet, and if you're a Windows Phone user the territory is already pretty familiar. The downside for me has been that I don't have a touchscreen, and so I spend a lot of time hunting along the edges of the screen for scrollbars and dragging around to be able to interact with everything. My chief complaint with the UI hasn't been with the Tile dashboard so much as it's been that the scroll bars are too skinny and at times I have to hunt for them.

Ultimately, time will tell whether people adjust to Windows 8 or long for the familiar.  I've found the IE 10 browser on the Tile side to be less compatible and more cranky with websites, but I expect that to change given time. I like the fact that antivirus and security are rolled into the OS without me having to take care of them or be interrupted with update notifications. The OS runs updates on a schedule that's far less aggressive than previous versions and thus far hasn't forced me into a reboot, and Microsoft has partnered with Adobe to roll their updates into Windows--no more random and frequent Adobe update nags. I've been told that the performance for gaming is supposed to be greater simply by virtue of a cleaner codebase, but I haven't seen anything substantially different apart from faster boot-up and shut-down times.  Gamers remember that you're also at the mercy of the game-maker--just as we've been with any OS release. The basic applications like Weather, Photos, Stocks, Mail, and more are very user-friendly, but solely within the context of the new look & feel:  expect little familar ground and a lot of new territory.

UPDATE:  Amazon customer Robert Haines points out (in the comments) that a program called Classic Shell will remove the Tiles interface and restore the 'classic' Start Menu.  There is also a program called Pokki that will let you customize your own UI.  A. Humphries also gives us a link in the comments below showing Stardock's product ""Start8"" and some good feedback on how it works.

UPDATE: Amazon customer AJ points out that although Windows 8 Pro may in the future require you to purchase a license for Windows Media Center separately, right now you can get a serial key for free via the Windows 8 site: just go to the Windows 8 ""Add Ons"" section. You may request up to 5 serial keys using different e-mail addresses and Microsoft will e-mail them to you within 24-48 hours.

UPDATE, 11/2013:  Microsoft has now released Windows 8.1, a minor update to the OS that mostly attempts to make the user experience better.  If you purhcase this copy of Windows 8, you will be offered the ability to update it to 8.1 at no additional cost.  The upgrade is pushed through the Windows Store that is part of Windows 8.  Personally, I've done clean installs of 8.1 from the MSDN media and done an in-place upgrade via the store, on both my desktop and laptop, and have not had good experiences.  I don't personally recommend the update at this time for that reason.  Peraps with time it will get better.

This review was posted under the System Builder DVD product listing of Windows 8. The three versions of Windows 8 are this ""just Windows 8"" version (which is a bit like Windows Home in earlier versions), ""Windows 8 Pro"", and ""Windows 8 Enterprise"". The generic Windows 8 that replaces ""Home"" in earlier versions has the basic feature set. The ""Pro"" flavor adds the BitLocker drive encryption we previously had to buy Windows Ultimate to obtain. It adds the ability to use Remote Desktop (that in my opinion should be in all versions of Windows), and it makes it easier to connect your computer to an Active Directory Domain. Windows 8 Pro is best for the power user or the small business and most people hardware-savvy enough to build their own machines will most likely prefer the added control they gain from using Pro.  If I were building a system for a non-savvy family member I might go with this standard version of Windows 8 though:  the likelihood of needing drive encryption or remote desktop on a system that would mostly be used for documents and web surfing isn't much, and I certainly don't have family or friends running their own AD Domains. ""Enterprise"" takes things one step further by being designed for use in medium to large businesses with corporate networks. There is also a ""Windows 8 RT"", but this version is solely intended for the ARM processors and other hardware built-in to tablet computers and is not intended for a desktop or laptop computer.",3
"This version of Windows 8 is referred to as the ""System Builder"" in that it is a full installation of Windows 8 and not an upgrade.  Windows 8 is a multi-boot friendly OS and the intention behind this particular disc is that persons building new machines can have a full version of the Windows 8 OS and install it without having to own a prior version of Windows--but it can also be installed on any hardware that meets the system requirements.  It is uncertain at this time whether this brand replaces the ""OEM"" versions many of us are familiar with, but for now the ""System Builder"" editions of Windows 8 are the only versions of Windows 8 being sold that are not an upgrade.  If you're building a new Windows machine it might make sense to take the plunge and go with the newest Microsoft OS.  If you want to keep your options open and do a dual-boot install on an older machine, thus far I've seen Windows 8 to be fairly multi-boot friendly, and I've even heard that the ""Windows Anywhere"" concept would allow you to install the OS on a removable drive (NOTE:  I have not tried this and do not have experience with it).

The different look and feel of Windows 8 boils down to one huge change:  the Start Menu that we have had since Windows 95 is no longer a menu.  It is a full-screen splash of tiles (formerly called ""the Metro UI""), each of which represents something installed on your computer.  This makes sense in that some of today's programs are more like the Windows Desktop Gadgets we've seen in Vista and 7:  they sit idle, stream information to you, and need a bit more room to be easy to read than the older Start Menu could allow them to have--instead of icons they are square tiles, and some programs' tiles are two squares wide.  It may take some arranging by you to get the tiles presented in a layout that makes sense to you.  If you've used Windows Media Center, Office 2010, or an XBox 360, you've already been interacting with similar interfaces--this sort of UI has been slowly making its way into Microsoft's products for a while now, but it's been beefed up to be more touchscreen friendly.

The rest of the Windows 8 OS spends its time balancing between the old and the new.  The desktop looks exactly like it did in Windows 7 and Vista, except there's no Start Button: you're expected to press the Windows key or move your mouse to the bottom corner of the screen to launch the tile dashboard.  Older programs run from within the Desktop view, but all programs can be launched directly off the tile screen:  programs unique to Windows 8 run one at a time in full screen, while older programs that run within the desktop can be resized. We have a version of Internet Explorer accessible from the desktop that looks just like IE 9 did in 7, then we have a version of Internet Explorer in the tile screen that looks entirely different.  Some parts of the Control Panel have the full-screen tile look and feel and often the options cascade left-to-right like the ""File"" menu in any MS Office 2010 product.  Other parts of the Control Panel look exactly like they did in Windows 7 and before.

Windows 8 is not all about appearance however.  In earlier versions of Windows, the number of programs running in the background could get unwieldy and slow things down.  There was a shift to using more Services under the covers, which are listeners that sit idle waiting to launch programs so that the programs don't have to run all the time.  Windows 7 started to get bogged down with a lot of running Services though, and performance-tweaking power users got in the habit of going in and adjusting them all to get back lost performance.

Microsoft have stripped several services out of Windows 8.  They have made the installation footprint (space taken and resources used) a bit smaller than Windows 7, and they've made Windows 8 run on any hardware that could run 7.  Programs that used to run, shut down, then have to be fully spooled up to run again are instead ""exsanguinated"" (Microsoft's term):  put on a virtual shelf and the resources they used handed back to the OS for other work.  Re-launch the program and it'll respond much faster due to having been left in this standby mode.  The Windows Vista and 7 ""Aero effects"" that gave your windows a glossy sheen and rounded corners used graphics and CPU to run, so they've been stripped out in favor of simple color schemes, blocky edges, and a bit of glassiness when looking at the Desktop.  Interaction with Windows in this new look and feel is easier if you have a touchscreen or you're using a tablet, and if you're a Windows Phone user the territory is already pretty familiar.  The downside is that those of us still relying on a mouse and keyboard find our time spent hunting along the edges of the screen for scrollbars and dragging our screens around to be able to interact most of the time.  As odd as the tile interface is, my chief complaint hasn't been with it so much as it's been that the scroll bars in most Windows 8 programs are too skinny.  This pixel-hunt can be very annoying when you see that 10 pixels more width would make this problem go away.

Like all Windows OS releases, time will truly tell us the full story.  I've found the IE 10 browser to be less compatible and more cranky with websites, but I expect that to change given time.  I like the fact that antivirus and security are rolled into the OS without me having to take care of them or be interrupted with update notifications.  The OS runs updates on a schedule that's far less aggressive than previous versions and thus far hasn't forced me into a reboot.  I've been told that the performance for gaming is supposed to be greater simply by virtue of a cleaner codebase, but I haven't seen anything substantially different in my framerate despite higher benchmarks in 3DMark 11.  I have however seen faster boot-up and shut-down times on one machine.  And once my programs launch, I don't even think about that tile layout waiting for me underneath.

The basic applications like Weather, Photos, Stocks, Mail, and more are very user-friendly, but solely within the context of the new look & feel:  expect little familar ground and a lot of new territory.  If you have a Windows Live account and/or SkyDrive, these can integrate fully into the OS:  so much so that you would sign in to the computer with your Windows Live/Hotmail account and everything you do would be synced to Microsoft's cloud.

If you're considering Windows 8, there are many benefits under the covers.  The patchwork way in which the OS seems to meld old into new can be confusing, and it's clear the UI pays lip service to mice while eagerly awaiting your first touch-screen or touch-pad purchase.  But to give credit where credit is due, there are benefits under the surface to go with the drawbacks you see before your eyes.  Putting Windows 8 Pro on a new system is a good hedge against longevity, but will require experienced Windows 7 (and below) users to be patient with the newer parts of the UI.

UPDATE:  Amazon customer Robert Haines says that there is a program called ""Classic UI"" that would restore the old look, so if you're dead-set on new code that skips the new UI, you might want to try that.  Other customers say that Stardock's program is worth the money.

UPDATE: Amazon customer AJ points out that although Windows 8 Pro may in the future require you to purchase a license for Windows Media Center separately, right now you can get a serial key for free via the Windows 8 site: just go to the Windows 8 ""Add Ons"" section. You may request up to 5 serial keys using different e-mail addresses and Microsoft will e-mail them to you within 24-48 hours.

UPDATE, 11/2013:  Microsoft has now released Windows 8.1, a minor update to the OS that mostly attempts to make the user experience better.  If you purhcase this copy of Windows 8, you will be offered the ability to update it to 8.1 at no additional cost.  The upgrade is pushed through the Windows Store that is part of Windows 8.  Personally, I've done clean installs of 8.1 from the MSDN media and done an in-place upgrade via the store, on both my desktop and laptop, and have not had good experiences.  I don't personally recommend the update at this time for that reason.  Peraps with time it will get better.

This review was posted under the System Builder DVD product listing of Windows 8 Pro.  The three versions of Windows 8 are ""just Windows 8"" (which is like Windows Home in earlier versions), ""Windows 8 Pro"", and ""Windows 8 Enterprise"".  The generic Windows 8 that replaces ""Home"" in earlier versions has the basic feature set.  This ""Pro"" flavor adds the BitLocker drive encryption we previously had to buy Windows Ultimate to obtain.  It adds the ability to use Remote Desktop (that in my opinion should be in all versions of Windows), and it makes it easier to connect your computer to an Active Directory Domain.  Windows 8 Pro is best for the power user or the small business and most people hardware-savvy enough to build their own machines will most likely prefer the added control they gain from using Pro.  ""Enterprise"" takes things one step further by being designed for use in medium to large businesses with corporate networks.  There is also a ""Windows 8 RT"", but this version is solely intended for the ARM processors and other hardware built-in to tablet computers and is not intended for a desktop or laptop computer.",3
"Or like me they will find themselves tolerating over time by ignoring it's most obnoxious features.

I've been running Windows 8 upgrade for the last couple of days and wanted to give my initial impressions of the latest Microsoft OS, as someone that's been using Windows forever i.e. Win 3.11;it's not as bad as I thought it was going to be and then again not as good as it could be.

First, I ran the compatibility checker of course and it said all hardware was compatible and only had a couple of software problems like it said I had to uninstall security essentials and wireshark not compatible. Not bad I thought. First impressions are important and the Windows 8 upgrade setup program didn't give a good first impression. It's more confusing that the older Win7 installer for experienced user. I couldn't tell if I could install on separate partition since the only options were erase everything or upgrade everything. And a WARNING if you plan on keeping Windows 7 around in case you are not sure if you want to stick with Windows 8 don't run the installer inside Windows because it will automatically upgrade Windows 7 to Windows 8! Later I figured out you can get the more familiar win 7 installer,if you boot directly from the DVD that is, where it lets you choose what partition to install on and let's you erase, create new partitions and do a clean install. Anyways, I did a dual boot install just to play it safe and keep Win7 around if needed. After finishing the install ,which didn't really seem much faster than Win7, and actually I thought it locked up at one point but it was hard to tell with the new plain square logo which doesn't even pulsate anymore like Win7 did when you booted.

After the upgrade completed, I found out that my wireless didn't work. That's right even though it said my wireless was compatible it didn't work and I just got yellow exclamation next to it. I was about to give up but I figured I just try the trick I did when Vista first came out which is use another wireless usb stick to connect to the Internet and see if windows could find any drivers for it and sure enough that worked,so much for an improvement over Win7 in that regard.

The first time you log into Windows 8 it plays a video showing you how to use Windows by moving your mouse to the edges. You know the GUI is unintuitive when they have to show a video just so you can figure out how to use the new OS GUI! If you don't want to waste time fumbling around trying to figure out where everything went and disappeared to learning the Win+X shortcut is essential! Actually, this is the first Windows version where I've actually used the keyboard more than my mouse since some things now take too many steps i.e. like shutting down or are near impossible to do. I got stuck a couple of times in some of the new metro apps took over my entire screen and I wasn't able to quit or get back to the desktop! Tip: if this happens to you just hit the Windows key on your keyboard. If you really can't stand the new GUI you can recreate everything just like in Win7 for the most part and stay in the classic desktop instead of the new metro start screen. I think the two things that are going to annoy most people is the lack of the Start button and inability to boot directly to the old classic desktop instead of Metro. I know it still bugs me!

All the programs and games I normally use in Windows 7 seem to work just fine in Windows 8. If it doesn't you can try right clicking to troubleshoot compatibility. My WEI score is the same in Win8 as it was in Win7 so seems no performance change according to that benchmark. Seems to be way more stable than Vista or even Win7 when it first came out. Gotten a lot fewer crashes than when Win7 first came out. My problematic wireless usb, which I mentioned isn't compatible, even though Windows 8 says it is has been causing the most problems even causing a BSOD!

Another thing I didn't like is that there was like a 200MB update as soon as I first logged in and unlike Win7, Win8 rudely rebooted my computer in the middle of a browsing session and didn't warn me or give me option to postpone the reboot. At least on Mac OS X there is option to restore all your windows and browser to the way you had them, even after a reboot. Some of the things I do like about it so far is that you can now read pdf files without having to install acrobat just like mac os has always been able to, and IE now comes with Flash already built in. It's always annoying having to install all those basic programs.

I really like the new task manager, it gives you a lot more info than before and Microsoft now has something that even mac os does which is very cool and needed by people nowadays with bandwidth caps, metered connections. If your right click your wireless it'll tell you how much bandwidth you have used. Now that I think about it a lot of the new stuff in Win8 seems like it's copied directly from OS X. For example, there are no games included now and Microsoft basically forces you to get minesweeper and solitare from the app store now! The icons on the metro screen are just like a cross between the widgets in OS X dashboard and launchpad. It's looks like they also copied the Xbox GUI and brought it into windows.

Smartscreen, which caught me off guard first time I tried installing something I downloaded from the Internet, is Microsoft's version of Gatekeeper which does the same thing on OS X. It get's very annoying if you don't have an Internet connection because it will appear that the installation program is frozen until it figures out you aren't connected! So that is one of the new security features they added to Win8. Secure boot is another one that is causing uproar in the Linux community since it causes headaches if you want to dual boot Windows and Linux.

Biggest disappointments, from a technical point of view, is that Win8 isn't 64bit only like we thought it would be a couple of years ago. Even Mac OS X is now fully 64-bit although that upset the people that couldn't upgrade their older Macs. Also, the Achilles heel of Windows, the registry, because it's too easy to corrupt and render Windows useless, is still there along with the winsxs problem. The WinSxs problem can grow out of hand and eat up all your disk space! I've been saying since XP ,why can't they include .net into windows instead of making you download it like Java? A couple of programs I tried to run said I needed the .net 2 or 3 mainly Steam games and so I had to download another 20-200MB file for that to work and you have to be connected to net to download it since there is no standalone version.

Another big letdown is that only the server version got the new filesystem ReFS, win8 only got storage spaces, which is more software raid. Microsoft has been promising a new improved filesystem several Windows versions back. I think the hardcore power users are going to have to accept the fact that the future of both Windows and Mac OS X is going to become and more geared to the iPod and Xbox crowd with their simplistic touch GUI and interface. This is also the group I'm guessing will have a more favorable view of the new GUI changes. I guess I'd probably be way more impressed if I had a touch capable PC since a lot of the new stuff seems to be geared towards that? I mean the command line is still there somewhere but it's hidden pretty good just like in OS X. Only thing I've really seen for geeks is something that macs and linux have been able to do for a long time already which is run the operating system from an external or usb stick, called windows to go but you need enterprise version for that.

As far as improvements in performance go, I haven't really seen any performance increases or disc space savings to warrant being in a rush to upgrade. My boot times are pretty much the same as with Win7 but then again I have an SSD drive , so Windows has already been pretty fast using that. In fact, the upgrade installer said I needed to free up at least 20GB of space min to even start the upgrade! Still no less than Win7 and XP only needs 10GB. Personally, I think I'll stick with Win8 it since I need to do a clean install on my SSD anyways since I have a whole bunch of old Windows 7 updates hogging up my SSD (the WinSXS problem I mentioned above) and haven't really had any major show stoppers so far like Vista or even Win7 when it first came out.

Finally, you need to get the media center upgrade, to play DVD's, otherwise you can't even play dvd's without installing powerdvd or some other program! I think this new version of Windows would be a lot more popular if it wasn't for Microsoft arbitrarily removing the start button so users are forced to use the new metro start screen whether you want to or not!

Finally they did add a new option to disk cleanup that few will notice that addresses the WinSXS issue:
This is a MAJOR improvement over Windows 7, but I bet they only did it for Windows 8 because of all the ranting about WinSxS.
This is a fantastic news for SSD users!

You can find Disk Cleanup by typing: WIN Key and start typing Disk Cleanup
Click the Disk Cleanup's ""Clean up System Files"" Button in the middle of the screen.
Check the box for Previous Windows Installation(s)
Click ""OK"" button and click the ""Delete"" Confirmation button.
Now, only if they included a registry cleaner!
and fixed the start button and booting into metro issues this would be a solid OS upgrade!",3
"I obtained a $15 upgrade license to Windows 8 Pro more than a year ago, when I purchased my desktop computer.  I was one of the early adopters of Windows 8, but immediately regretted it due to major incompatibility and usability problems, so I went and reverted back to Windows 7.  At that time, I felt it was too early to write a fair review.  I mean, for me it was a major screw up from Microsoft, but I also felt that MS had a point in producing a touch-screen oriented OS, and that I should probably wait and see if this actually was the way to go in the near future.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt and stood down from blasting them with a negative review.
A year later comes Windows 8.1, claiming adjustments were implemented for the non-touch-screen user base, in an attempt to convince more people into adopting their new OS platform.
Windows 8.1 is free for Windows 8 users, so I decided to give it another chance.  I figured, why waste all of $15 dollars on a new OS and not take advantage of this redeeming opportunity? So here's how it went.

*** Edit: Forgot to mention the upgrade path for Windows 8.1.  You upgrade from Windows 7, to Windows 8, from 32 bit to 32 bit and 64 bit to 64 bit.  Going from 32 to 64 bit requires a full/fresh install (it wipes documents, programs, etc.), not an upgrade.  Also, you can't upgrade from Win 7 64-bit to Win 8 32-bit.  Once you upgrade to Windows 8, you can upgrade to 8.1 by downloading the point release in the Microsoft Store, available as a tile icon on the Windows 8 new Metro desktop.  The 8.1 download will be available only after you have applied all critical Windows 8 post-upgrade fixes.  It may take a few restarts until you get all Windows 8 updates.  If you plan to update directly from Win 7 to Win 8.1, you will require a full/fresh install, it is also not part of the upgrade path.  end Edit ***

Upgrade process:
Upgrade assistant displayed a report with potential application compatibility issues.
Not all of the installed applications are scanned during this process, only those apps that Microsoft has registered on their database.  You have to cross your fingers for other applications on your system to work with Windows 8.1.  I suggest some investigative work prior to committing to the upgrade process, especially if one of those unreported apps is considered critical for you.
The initial stages of the upgrade show you the incompatible applications and drivers for Windows 8.  This was scary at first, because one of the apps was the actual antivirus software, which ironically is their own MS Security Essentials. The actual reason for the message is that Windows 8 includes its own AV software integrated with the OS called Windows Defender. Security Essentials is now a pre Windows 8 product.
The other two incompatible applications were the Blue Tooth and USB 3.0 controllers.  Later after the upgrade I found out that these were actually replaced with Windows 8.1 versions, but this is not clearly explained during the upgrade; at that point they were just incompatible, okay? You figure it out.  It felt a little uncomfortable, sitting in front of your screen contemplating whether these incompatibilities will impact your upgrade or not.  I could imagine a non-technical user hitting Esc or Cancel immediately after seeing this.  I saw this as a challenge, I dared Windows 8.1 to mess with my working Windows 7 setup, so I followed their directions to uninstall Security Essentials and the USB and Bluetooth drivers and continue faithfully (blindly)with the process.  After that, a Steam game was reported as incompatible and two others required patches supposedly available from their developers.  Fortunately in this case, all the games worked fine after the upgrade was completed (with all Windows updates applied).
The actual upgrade took approximately two hours or so (including the initial download).  It actually took longer to apply the Windows updates after the actual upgrade.  In total, it took approximately 3.5 hrs to finish the entire upgrade, and most of this time was spent ""watching paint dry"".

Post upgrade issues (One major and one minor issue):

Major issue - Higher than normal CPU usage with and idle computer and abnormally high CPU temperatures (55C - 60C).  After some investigation, it was an Intel Storage Controller driver compatibility issue.  Replacing the Windows driver with the PC manufacturer's version made this issue go away.  If it wasn't for a small CPU temperature app (Speed Fan) I wouldn't have discovered the problem with who knows what future consequences.

Minor issue - A third party app that was not displayed on the Windows compatibility report, no longer works with Windows 8.1.  It was not a big deal for me because the software developer has not upgraded this software for almost two years now anyway (DarkBasic Pro).

Personal gripes:

- The new Metro interface - It's designed for touch screen devices, I have a Desktop.  Isn't it possible to write a piece of code to detect whether or not you have a touch screen device and adjust the Metro desktop accordingly?

- Windows button - It's there, but it does not work as I believe many of us were expecting it to work, to give us the familiar Start menu with All Programs.  You still have to use the metro interface to search or browse for your programs.  You'll have to get used to it.  On the positive side, the shortcut to common system options when you right click the Windows icons is a nice plus.

- File History - There is no Backup and Restore anymore.  It seems that with every Windows upgrade, a key functionality is removed from this important component.  From XP to Win 7 you lost the ability to backup to network drives, unless you purchased the Ultimate edition. Windows 8.1 replaced Backup and Restore with File History, which is limited to backing up files located in Documents, Music, Video, Desktop and Pictures folders.  You are no longer able to customize the backup to save files from other folder on your computer.  You will have to relocate folders into any of the valid backup folders.  It still saves backups on external drives only.  Shared drives or even Sky Drive are not backup options.
The automated backup occurs a few times during the day.  You can backup on demand, but have no control of the automated backup frequency.  The backup format is different than the format used in Windows 7.  If you used to have a backup in Windows 7 format, now you have two different sets of backups on the same drive.

- Minor gripe, it feels redundant having application shortcuts on your regular Desktop and your Metro desktop.

Pluses

- The Sports tile - It's nice to have an option to select favorite team news. The results, standings, and stats information is always up to date and quickly available.
- The News tile was awesome until it stopped working...
- In Metro, the option to search programs organized by most commonly used is very convenient
- I still have my Desktop and shortcuts.
- Windows boots a little faster and it handles CPU cycles very well.  Components are running cool and efficient.

Current issues

- News tile opens and closes and does not display news.  Currently I can't read news, although I can see the headline updates on the actual tile icon.

- The lock screen actually lives up to its name.  After a while of inactivity (haven't nailed the actual time it takes before the system locks up), the lock screen remains there and you can't get past it to the logon.  The mouse cursor icon moves, and the keyboard is responding (can see Caps lock light switching on and off) but it's not possible to get to the actual log on screen. Windows does not respond to Ctrl-Alt-Del, esc keys, mouse clicks, space bar or any key combination. The only solution is to power down, and then be greeted with a message that the computer did not shutdown cleanly during power up.

- Sky Drive - Stopped working the first day after I cancelled a large file upload.  There's an error message, but no option to resolve the issue.  The message shows up every time I open Sky drive, and have not been able to delete or add any more files ever since, and the message cannot be deleted. The only way to use Sky Drive is by using the ol' regular web browser method.

- File Search - For some reason it takes forever to open .jpg files directly from the search results, no matter how small the file size is.  You have to select the option to open file location and then click on the file within File Explorer to get a quick response.  This issue does not happen with videos, Word documents, or PDFs.

Conclusion
- It will probably take some time to get all the issues corrected. In my case, they are not really critical issues, but they are nonetheless annoying and make you feel like
Microsoft again gave more importance to general compatibility than to stability and usability.

- It still seems to me that Microsoft is still insisting on forcing people to adopt the touch screen technologies with the Metro interface.  I insist it's still too early for that and Microsoft should adjust their OS's to accommodate to their user demands not the other way around.

- It was a rocky start, but I'm okay with the current application compatibility.  As long as I can play my Steam games and use my personal finance apps, I'm a happy camper.
It's a keeper, for now just because I feel too lazy to go through a factory reset back to Windows 7.  Three stars for now.  I'll keep you posted...",3
"The initial portion of this review addresses the final stage of an progressive upgrade from Windows 7 with an intermediate step --lasting one year-- at Windows 8 before progressing to Windows 8.1.

Bottom line up front: If you are a power user of Windows 7, and you can keep running your current hardware with a Windows 7 variant: I can't offer a single compelling reason to make this change. If you're already using Windows 8, proceeding with the evolution to Windows 8.1 will provide a marginal improvement to the user experience with the return (sort of) of the Start button (with much less functionality than in earlier versions of Windows).

I've made this upgrade to two computers. For a desktop computer that met the full Windows Store system requirements, I proceeded with the upgrade from Windows 8 from the Store. A netbook I installed Windows 8 on did not have sufficient display resolution to install 8.1 directly from the Windows Store, so I had to run the installation separately via a downloadable 8.1 installer application.

The good news:
(1) In both installation cases, The Windows 8 to 8.1 upgrade was issue free (which mirrored the earlier Windows 7 to Windows 8 upgrade experience for both machines). It retained all of my previously installed OS settings, data files and applications.
(2) In addition to the return of a psuedo-Start menu, Windows 8.1 offers an option to boot directly to the Destop. Being able to bypass the Metro ""charms"" page can only be described as an awesome improvement.

The not so good news: once Windows 8.1 was in place, the user interface remains fundamentally the same Windows 8 experience that is kindly described as ""awkward at best"". After more than a year of using this operating system, I still feel like I'm working at half speed whenever I interacting with it.

Most of the 8.1 improvements over Windows 8 are under the hood. The biggest user interface change is the return --sort of-- of the Start button. It is rather non-intuitive in that you have to right mouse click to reveal it. Once you do, you'll learn that it is more like a cousin than a brother to the Start button from pre-Windows 8 versions. You will encounter an utter lack of customizing (no pinning programs you use most often, no recent documents listing, no dragging items from the task bar to the Star menu). 8.1 still forces you to its Metro/Charms ""alternate"" desktop for any real power-user functions. Yes, it's an improvement over Windows 8 for simpler navigation to start/shutdown options. For those used to a high degree of start menu customization, this will not slake your thirst (although you'll feel less like you're crawling through a desert towards a mirage than under Windows 8).

Like Windows 8, Windows 8.1 would really, really like you to establish an online log-in with Microsoft. It would also really, really like for you to permit Microsoft to ""improve your search and other user experiences"" (or something similar; if I were talking to you face-to-face, those would be big old air quotes"", because a cynical user might think Microsoft had another interest in compiling vast amounts of user data to improve marketing opportunity and revenue streams). You can bypass all this and set your log in via with a more traditional --and more private-- local user account, which is my preference. But the interface does not make this option highly visible.

Finally, prior to the installation of Windows 8.1, I had a nicely functioning dual-boot (Windows and Ubuntu) machine. No longer. The boot loader appears after POST, but the Windows/Ubuntu boot loader is non-responsive to either keyboard or mouse commands, and it simply pauses for the programmed delay (4 seconds in my case) and the goes to Windows. Since my Linux is a hobby, this is not a show-stopper, but this could be a deal-breaker for a user with a non-negotiable need for a multi-OS machine.

The remainder of this review addresses the earlier Windows 7 to Windows 8 ""upgrade"" that preceded the move to 8.1. If you are proceeding to Windows 8.1 directly from Windows 7, this is what you can expect.

---------

This review separates the Windows 8 upgrade/installation experience from the user interface experience. While I consider myself a power user of Windows 7, this didn't come only in its use since upgrading to that OS three years ago . Any proficiency I enjoyed as a Windows 7 user evolved from much longer experience acquired during the evolution of its predecessors (going back to Windows 95). Windows 8 offers a much different user interface (at least to ""start"" with...pun intended) that relies less on on your prior expertise with earlier Windows operating systems. Much of it will be familiar to users of earlier Windows versions, but it has enough differences to remind you frequently that this is *not* the Windows OS you've become --for better or worse-- familiar with. Because of this, I'm going easy on assessing it until I've had a more time using it for my normal productivity tasks (but so far, I'm lukewarm on the interface).

Since this is an *upgrade* version of Windows 8, this review emphasizes the *upgrade* process, which is not the same as a review focused on the overall user experience. So far, I'm neutral on the interface changes. Lets just say I won't be in a hurry to upgrade all of my existing Windows 7 machines to Windows 8.

Bottom line: This was by far the easiest, most intuitive Windows upgrade I've performed. This is compared with many Windows upgrades and fresh installs going back to 98, ME, Vista and 7. It took less than an hour and successfully retained my existing applications and data files.

What's in the box?
(1) 32-bit installation DVD
(2) 64-bit installation DVD
(3) a product key card
(4) a single page getting started guide

Windows 8 system requirements are essentially the same as Windows 7 (which were generally LESS demanding than Vista and XP requirements). I installed Windows 8 over Windows 7 on a 5-year old Dell XPS 420 with a 32-bit 3 GHZ Intel Core2 Duo processor, 4 GB RAM and an ATI Radeon HD 2600 video processor. Total upgrade time took less than an hour.

The installation process went as follows after inserting the installation DVD:
(1) ""Preparing"": took about 3 minutes to check for and download updates online.

(2) Windows 8 offered to either preserve your existing applications data files (and some settings) or do a fresh install. I chose to retain my applications and data. In either case, you'll want save --and have access to-- backup copies of your data files and application media/files BEFORE you go through the upgrade and installation.

(3) The install processes ran on my machine for about 28 minutes, then went through a series of restarts. During this time a ""percentage complete"" message ran on the monitor.

(4) After a final, farewell appearance of a Windows 7 desktop and another restart, Windows 8 went into a ""getting ready"" process. At this point it presented options for:
-personalization
-wireless network connections
-express or custom setup
-some privacy-related settings and registration options with Microsoft (these defaulted to not sharing or not required...which is good!)

(5) It then proceeded to a ""finalizing"" process. At this point is when the upgrade process really shined: it recognized an existing Linux/Ubuntu 12.04 partition on my hard drive and the existing Windows/Ubuntu dual-boot options. It not only preserved Ubuntu functionality, but offered options for selecting your default OS and delay options for the boot loader display.

After finalizing and restarting, Windows 8 recognized all my existing peripherals. All of my existing data and applications were available with no problem. Boot time is about 45 seconds and shutdown time is about 21 seconds.

Comments on the interface experience:
I understand some of the initial hostility this OS has received. While the familiar desktop metaphor lives on (and once you are there, the differences between this and previous Windows user experiences are minimal), before you get there, you have to learn to live with a separate ""Start"" page. Out of the box this page heavily populated with many online services that Microsoft would clearly be interested in driving your attention (and your wallet!) to. The good news is these are easily removable.

Your keyboard's Windows key will become a powerful tool, as it allows rapid switching between the desktop and start screens. If you have a Windows 8 compatible touchpad (like the Logitech T650), then its ""gestures"" also permit rapid switching.

At this point, I consider myself still learning the new interface. Some features seem less than intuitive (like how to shut down, for example), but look how we've grown accustomed to the ""Start"" button being the place to go to stop working!

As I write this, I'm learning to master both the new interface and use of a touchpad instead of a mouse. While I'm not yet working as intuitively as I was with Windows 7, the learning curve hasn't been a deal breaker. The start screen seems mostly an invitation to hook users into use of applications tied to a registered Microsoft account, and the cynical (and privacy-minded) part of me doesn't see great value added in this. It also a place to display your frequently used applications, files, folders and system controls for rapid access.

Bottom line: EASY upgrade process, Ubuntu-friendly and a little learning curve. We've certainly had worse new operating systems from Microsoft in the past...

Note: I've since performed a second install on a netbook that did not have sufficient video resolution to display Windows 8 tiled apps that run on its Start screen. Otherwise, this upgrade path was similarly problem free, and similarly retained existing applications and data present under Windows 7.",3
"The initial portion of this review addresses the final stage of an progressive upgrade from Windows 7 with an intermediate step --lasting one year-- at Windows 8 before progressing to Windows 8.1 shortly after its release in late 2013.

I've made this upgrade to three computers. For a desktop and a laptop meeting that met the full Windows Store system requirements, I proceeded with the upgrade from Windows 8 from the ""Store"" charm in Metro. A netbook running Windows 8 on did not have sufficient display resolution to install 8.1 directly from the Windows Store, so I had to run the installation separately via a downloadable 8.1 installer application.

The good news: In all installation cases, The Windows 8 to 8.1 upgrade was issue free (which mirrored the earlier Windows 7 to Windows 8 upgrade experience for both machines). It retained all of my previously installed OS settings, data files and applications.

The not so good news: once Windows 8.1 was in place, the user interface remains fundamentally the same Windows 8 experience that is kindly described as ""awkward at best"". After more than a year of using this operating system, I still feel like I'm working at half speed whenever I interacting with it.

Most of the 8.1 improvements over Windows 8 are under the hood. The biggest user interface change is the return --sort of-- of the Start button. It is rather non-intuitive in that you have to right mouse click to reveal it. Once you do, you'll learn that it is more like a cousin than a brother to the Start button from pre-Windows 8 versions. You will encounter an utter lack of customizing (no pinning programs you use most often, no recent documents listing, no dragging items from the task bar to the Star menu). 8.1 still forces you to its Metro/Charms ""alternate"" desktop for any real power-user functions. Yes, it's an improvement over Windows 8 for simpler navigation to start/shutdown options. For those used to a high degree of start menu customization, this will not slake your thirst (although you'll feel less like you're crawling through a desert towards a mirage than under Windows 8).

Like Windows 8, Windows 8.1 would really, really like you to establish an online log-in with Microsoft. It would also really, really like for you to permit Microsoft to ""improve your search and other user experiences"" (or something similar; if I were talking to you face-to-face, those would be big old air quotes"", because a cynical user might think Microsoft had another interest in compiling vast amounts of user data to improve marketing opportunity and revenue streams). You can bypass all this and set your log in via with a more traditional --and more private-- local user account, which is my preference. But the interface does not make this option highly visible.

Finally, prior to the installation of Windows 8.1, I had a nicely functioning dual-boot (Windows and Ubuntu) machine. No longer. The boot loader appears after POST, but the Windows/Ubuntu boot loader is non-responsive to either keyboard or mouse commands, and it simply pauses for the programmed delay (4 seconds in my case) and the goes to Windows. Since my Linux is a hobby, this is not a show-stopper, but this could be a deal-breaker for a user with a non-negotiable need for a multi-OS machine.

The remainder of this review addresses the earlier Windows 7 to Windows 8 ""upgrade"" that preceded the move to 8.1. If you are proceeding to Windows 8.1 directly from Windows 7, this is what you can expect.

---------

This review separates the Windows 8 upgrade/installation experience from the user interface experience. While I consider myself a power user of Windows 7, this didn't come only in its use since upgrading to that OS three years ago . Any proficiency I enjoyed as a Windows 7 user evolved from much longer experience acquired during the evolution of its predecessors (going back to Windows 95). Windows 8 offers a much different user interface (at least to ""start"" with...pun intended) that relies less on on your prior expertise with earlier Windows operating systems. Much of it will be familiar to users of earlier Windows versions, but it has enough differences to remind you frequently that this is *not* the Windows OS you've become --for better or worse-- familiar with. Because of this, I'm going easy on assessing it until I've had a more time using it for my normal productivity tasks (but so far, I'm lukewarm on the interface).

Since this is an *upgrade* version of Windows 8, this review emphasizes the *upgrade* process, which is not the same as a review focused on the overall user experience. So far, I'm neutral on the interface changes. Lets just say I won't be in a hurry to upgrade all of my existing Windows 7 machines to Windows 8.

Bottom line: This was by far the easiest, most intuitive Windows upgrade I've performed. This is compared with many Windows upgrades and fresh installs going back to 98, ME, Vista and 7. It took less than an hour and successfully retained my existing applications and data files.

What's in the box?
(1) 32-bit installation DVD
(2) 64-bit installation DVD
(3) a product key card
(4) a single page getting started guide

Windows 8 system requirements are essentially the same as Windows 7 (which were generally LESS demanding than Vista and XP requirements). I installed Windows 8 over Windows 7 on a 5-year old Dell XPS 420 with a 32-bit 3 GHZ Intel Core2 Duo processor, 4 GB RAM and an ATI Radeon HD 2600 video processor. Total upgrade time took less than an hour.

The installation process went as follows after inserting the installation DVD:
(1) ""Preparing"": took about 3 minutes to check for and download updates online.

(2) Windows 8 offered to either preserve your existing applications data files (and some settings) or do a fresh install. I chose to retain my applications and data. In either case, you'll want save --and have access to-- backup copies of your data files and application media/files BEFORE you go through the upgrade and installation.

(3) The install processes ran on my machine for about 28 minutes, then went through a series of restarts. During this time a ""percentage complete"" message ran on the monitor.

(4) After a final, farewell appearance of a Windows 7 desktop and another restart, Windows 8 went into a ""getting ready"" process. At this point it presented options for:
-personalization
-wireless network connections
-express or custom setup
-some privacy-related settings and registration options with Microsoft (these defaulted to not sharing or not required...which is good!)

(5) It then proceeded to a ""finalizing"" process. At this point is when the upgrade process really shined: it recognized an existing Linux/Ubuntu 12.04 partition on my hard drive and the existing Windows/Ubuntu dual-boot options. It not only preserved Ubuntu functionality, but offered options for selecting your default OS and delay options for the boot loader display.

After finalizing and restarting, Windows 8 recognized all my existing peripherals. All of my existing data and applications were available with no problem. Boot time is about 45 seconds and shutdown time is about 21 seconds.

Comments on the interface experience:
I understand some of the initial hostility this OS has received. While the familiar desktop metaphor lives on (and once you are there, the differences between this and previous Windows user experiences are minimal), before you get there, you have to learn to live with a separate ""Start"" page. Out of the box this page heavily populated with many online services that Microsoft would clearly be interested in driving your attention (and your wallet!) to. The good news is these are easily removable.

Your keyboard's Windows key will become a powerful tool, as it allows rapid switching between the desktop and start screens. If you have a Windows 8 compatible touchpad (like the Logitech T650), then its ""gestures"" also permit rapid switching.

At this point, I consider myself still learning the new interface. Some features seem less than intuitive (like how to shut down, for example), but look how we've grown accustomed to the ""Start"" button being the place to go to stop working!

As I write this, I'm learning to master both the new interface and use of a touchpad instead of a mouse. While I'm not yet working as intuitively as I was with Windows 7, the learning curve hasn't been a deal breaker. The start screen seems mostly an invitation to hook users into use of applications tied to a registered Microsoft account, and the cynical (and privacy-minded) part of me doesn't see great value added in this. It also a place to display your frequently used applications, files, folders and system controls for rapid access.

Bottom line: EASY upgrade process, Ubuntu-friendly and a little learning curve. We've certainly had worse new operating systems from Microsoft in the past...

Note: I've since performed a second install on a netbook that did not have sufficient video resolution to display Windows 8 tiled apps that run on its Start screen. Otherwise, this upgrade path was similarly problem free, and similarly retained existing applications and data present under Windows 7.",3
"Note: In this review, I purposefully did NOT read the user manual and I expected all features to be obvious (e.g. on a par with other video/audio editing software) in the execution of Pinnacle software.

In mid December, 2014: I loaded Pinnacle Plus V18 from the CD and got installation error messages from Windows:

1. Cant open .dtd file. Windows says this is a Unix hyperhelp support file. I don't know what is trying to open this file. I told it to use Pinnacle to open it, figuring it might be a Pinnacle help file.
2. Cant open .wmdb file. This is a windows media database file developed by Microsoft. So, what is trying to open it?
3. Cant open .all file. A .all file is on my computer. Steinberg VST uses .all files.
4. Cant open .ovw file. This is a Cool Edit Pro file.

In the above cases, if Pinnacle was trying to open these files, why would I not get an error message from Pinnacle?
I brought up Pinnacle. The program (organizer) started searching my entire disk for all possible movies, music, and photos, loading icons of them into a Media tab. I have hundreds of video files and thousands of pictures and audio files. It then proceeded to tell me about errors loading various files. In my opinion, it would be preferable, and far less time consuming, to allow me to open my own files and folders to add media, rather than defaulting to loading ALL media. It could give me an option to load all media.

There was a new version to download. So that took another 10 minutes or so.

Noticed the graphics on my screen were not very clear. The letters were tiny and jammed together. The program should make adjustments for the screen resolution I am using.

I brought up Pinnacle and tried to load a .MTS file from a folder. It did not seem to recognized .MTS files, so I could not use it to create the video I needed to edit. Dont know whether I didn't wait long enough or whether it was a new version, but so be it.

About a week later: I brought started Pinnacle again and it was now loading .MTS files - all of them on my disk. This time, I was able to drag and drop a .MTS file into the AV1 timeline. There is a view screen of the video loaded and current time position. To see if I could capture a picture or get a list of handy commands for the current video, I tried to right click on the current frame of the view screen. No option list came up. I would have preferred to see at least SOME commonly used options like Add Effect, Add Transition, save frame as Image, File Info, or things like that. Instead, I had to hunt for commands, icons, or options.

On the Media Tab, I wanted to drag and drop a movie. By the time the organizer finally finished loading all music, photos, and videos on my computer, it had hundreds of folder names, each one expanded and showing me icons of all the media files it recognized. I could not collapse these categories all at once via any options I found. I tried ctrl-minus keys at the same time, but that shortened the video I had in the timeline. So I undid that via ctrl-z (thinking that would undo the last command) and it removed the video from the AV1 timeline. Sigh.

I also notice that when I click on various things and edited video, the place in the Media Tab re-centered itself to a midpoint (in my photo library) that was not anywhere near where I actually was my position of hundreds of media folders. So I had to keep re-scrolling and finding where the clips were. Not good.

There is a Navigation title on the left side of the Media Tab and it has some options, but none to collapse all categories. It does allow view of only videos. But then, I have a folder where I keep my free video music from other video software. This is a really cumbersome user interface. Again, I should have been able to tell it what to load rather than having all this stuff visible in a miles-long longitudinal list of folders and files.

There is a 3D option at the menu top. This allows view of only 3D (to view only three-dimensional images and videos in my library). I clicked on this since I have NO 3D files on my computer. It never did complete, but it told me it was filtering... I stopped it because I had to sleep sometime.

Adjusting Video: The original video I shot was indoors and was too reddish and too saturated. I selected the video adjustments and clicked on White Balance and Levels. On my screen, this appeared to automatically adjust the picture, but it was not good looking on my screen. So, I played with the adjustments.

The individual adjustments are pretty good. There is one called Haze that I have not seen in other editors and appears to adjust the haziness of the video. That is a really nice and UNIQUE feature.

The White Balance adjustment works like a photo editor, except this is on the video section. You select (via an eyedropper) a spot on the current frame that is supposed to be white. The editor adjusts all the colors of that video in order to make that spot white. This is a very handy and user-friendly feature to have for color adjustment. I have not seen this photographic feature on other video editors.

The program appears to have other handy features, like its competitors, for things like splitting audio from video, taking a snapshot of a frame and saving it, splicing at the frame level, and others. Roxio (in my older versions) does not have frame by frame editing/splicing.

Audio: There is a graphic representation of the audio, panning, and volume. One of the volume adjustment knobs is for master level and one for current position. However, when I adjusted the current position volume, it lowered the level of the entire video. When I split the video, it adjusted the sound of the section I was on. So, the wording is misleading. However, you can add key frames (simply by clicking on the audio green line) to allow increasing or decreasing volume (and fade out/in) so that any loud or weak areas in the audio can be manually altered. This feature is similar to other product audio timeline methods, but in my opinion, it was more user friendly and obvious to a video-phile.

When I right click on a clip, it should allow me to add fade in and out of audio with some default setting (e.g. 1 second). I did not see this option anywhere and it seemed I had to manually add fade in and out of audio. I may have missed something, but it wasn't obvious.

Titles/Text: I really liked the way the titles allow for graphical real-time fade in and out, time stretching, colorizing, etc. The click and drag method of fade-in and fade-out for a clip is much easier to adjust than using new window timelines with separate marker drags and drops. Pinnacle allows it right on the clip itself without having to deal with new windows and marking/unmarking. So, by adjusting the timeline wide enough, it is much faster to create an overlapping fading in and out title/text for a clip. Also, I noticed that dragging the timeline out and in also keeps the fade in and out at the ends of the title. With some other video editing programs, one has to manually go back in and move the start of fade in or fade-out to a different position if the title is extended.

Snapshot a frame: It is easy to take a snapshot. Find the frame you want and click the camera button. This puts the picture in a Collection tab along with the other tabs for media and transitions, etc. However, I could not find an easy way to get all the photos I took from the Collection tab to the file folder I wanted them in. Instead, I had to click on each photo, right click, select export, and wait for the exporter to come up. Little did I know that each photo was in a different folder. I would much rather have the program ask me where to place photos than to put them somewhere and then allow users to later discover them somewhere on their drive. There was also an autoname checkbox. Thinking that this would auto-name each photo by adding a number to it, I checked it (and by the way, it did add a number to each photo). Because I did not know these were saved automatically somewhere else, the autoname came up on every single photo I was saving to the folder I had selected. I believed I had to click it and export each and every photo. And each photo save asked me if I wanted to overwrite every time I exported. Each photo save also gave me an option to open the folder to view the photo (which I declined since I had just saved it). Come on folks, just tell me in the beginning where photos are being saved, and don't ask me to open it each time!!

Clip Manipulation: One can mark a beginning clip, go to a later clip, and hold down shift and click on that last clip you want in the clicked series (just like clicking on first and last Windows files in an Explorer Window). You can also stay in zoom mode and hit the end key to get to the last clip. When you hit shift-click, all clips will then be selected in between. This allows grouping or moving a sequence of clips. Some other programs do not allow that shift-click to mark all clips in between. Rather, you have to use the mouse to click and drag across all clips to mark them for moving. Pinnacle allows both methods. That, I like!

On the down side, moving a clip to the left leaves the other clips where they were and creates a gap. There is a Magnetic Snapping button, and a Smart Editing selection that seem (as they are worded)  to allow for automatic clip moving. However, I could not get these to move the following clips to close a gap automatically. So, I had to select all clips (from the gap on) and move them manually. They snapped to the end of the last clip gap, but I would have preferred that the gap close automatically.

One last note. When you copy (ctrl-c) and paste (ctrl-v) a text title, it creates a duplicate of the text title to which you can then add or modify text, length, fades, etc. It does not affect the original title. At least one other competitive product changes the original title when you change the copy. I find that more difficult to work with than a clean, new, editable copy.

Disc Menus: I found this mostly straightforward to use. One great feature is that you can move sub-menus to a previous menu and delete the subsequent sub-menus. I cannot do this with other pre-canned menus and sub-menus. They do not allow moving of scenes or adding to the number of scenes the say Pinnacle does.

One thing seemed to be a bug. I changed the color of text on the Scene Selection button on the main menu. In the editor, I changed it to red, but it appeared black in the editor. When I clicked OK, the viewer and thumbnails showed red text. But pressing play on the menu viewer (to simulate a DVD menu) showed black. Then I discovered the Stereoscopic button had been checked. I don't recall checking this, but I might have. Since I don't have anything 3-D, this was a nuisance (as well as mind-bender).

Saving files: It was not apparent that I could save a project and have everything (including disc processing) saved. When I created a menu, it seemed to be a separate disc project file. It was not clear that the original movie project file had or had not been saved when I saved a disc project file. Since these are all in the same video editor, it would be easier to use if it were a single project save, and not separate saves. Also, it seemed to be an Export rather than a save. To this user, export implies a new changed rendering of a video file. This is completely different than saving the video editing of a file which is a completely separate formatting of an original file which does not change the original.

Burning to Disc: I could not burn the project to a DVD. Although I inserted a blank DVD+R and the file size to be written was only 17 minutes of video, it told me the medium did not match 4.7GB and asked if I should proceed anyway. I said Yes. It told me there was not enough room to burn the disc even though it showed there was plenty of room. I tried several blank DVD+R disks, and a dual layer blank disk. Same message.

I went to the website to see about technical support. The instructions said I should have received a number when I registered my product and that I had to have registered within the last 14 days to get technical support. I received a password via email but no such number. The only telephone number to call was a sales line. I checked the FAQs and found the error message I had received, but the only fix for it was to insert the proper sized disc. There is an option to submit an impersonal (email) request for technical support or to have paid support. This is a rabbit hole I did not go down. There was no technical chat capability.
So, now I have a fully edited movie, a fully edited menu, and no way to save it to a DVD or to be sure I have saved it to my hard drive. And, no way to contact Pinnacle directly in my hour of need before I shut down. Pinnacle users may derive what they will. Adobe encourages its users to contact them directly. Hmmm...

Summary: I found most of the software features to be as good as, or better than, competitive products.
  Copy and paste of a title creates an independent copy of that title;
  Adjusting video includes a haze adjustment;
  Clip length is easy to adjust and has the fade (video/audio) move with the adjustment;
  Marking clips for inclusion in a group is straightforward (click first and shift-click last marks all clips in between); and,
  Taking a frame snapshot is easy.

Some areas of improvement were the following.
 Initial installation gave mysterious error messages for file types I had to look up;
 Two new versions were released in the week I tested this;
 The automatic population of the library is very cumbersome when you have thousands of files on your system. It should ask  before doing this;
 Right clicking on the view port should have some kind of menu;
 A right click on the clip (audio or video) should allow for selection of either to fade-in and/or fade-out;
 Could not find an easy way to close gaps created when a clip is moved to the left or right.
 Have some way for users to contact the help desk when there is an obvious problem.
 There should at least be a technical chat capability for quick questions.",3
"UPDATE 4/23/13:  if you've installed Windows 7 or 8 FIRST, and the installation is 32-bit, then you can indeed install these older MS Office programs.  I installed MS Office Professional 2000 and 2002 on two Dell Windows 7 Professional 32-bit laptops.  The 2003 is installed on a third Dell Windows 7 Pro, but is an Optiplex.  Get 2002 or 2000, as 2003 (especially in Outlook) is very annoying.  The latter also removes backwards compatibility UNLESS you download the UnlockExcel.reg and UnlockWord.reg files from MS (free download).  And, be sure not to accept the MS Office 2003 bizillion updates for alleged problems.  Again, 2002 and prior are a better buy (more customizable, more add-ins, nicer), unless you have some specific need for 2003.

Rest of the review follows below, without further edit.

UPDATE 9/9/12: This review is long and unwieldy, sorry; it covers not only the upgrade version listed here; but also, this review compares full versions of Office 2003 and prior.  I'll be editing this review ad hoc, too.  The problem here is the LACK OF BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY imposed by later versions of Windows or Office.  So it becomes very complicated, to explain the variant problems with different MS versions of Office, and how to make them work.  If you have older files, you have to deal with these complex problems.  Hence this review:  it's mind-boggling.  MS has now made computing far more difficult than necessary.

According to Windows 7 Compatibility advisor, Office 2002 and prior are NOT compatible with Windows 7.  But according to users in the PC World forums, you can still use Office 2000-2002, especially Word and Excel, but might have problems with Outlook 2000, IF IF IF you configured it to run your email (the email passwords won't store, when Outlook 2000 is run from Win7 OS).  Google for PC World Office 2000, 2002 and for Windows 7.  Replace 'PC World' with 'MS Answers Forums' to see the same issues discussed in MS Answers Forums.  Pity that MS won't support its own products, when the newer versions of the same products, are worse.

SHORT SUMMARY: The #1 reason to buy this older (pre-2003) software, now that it's outdated -- is for backwards-compatibility.  And, some of its older functions work better than in Word 2003 et seq.  And, if you migrate to Win 7, you'll lose Outlook Express (one of the few stable and good programs MS has written, so OF COURSE they get rid of it).  So you'll have to learn Microsoft Outlook, anyway.  This matters most, because Outlook after version 2000, stinks.  Your other alternative will be SmartSuite version 9.8 and prior, from IBM.  Those versions are also backwards-compatible.  Latest SmartSuite might not be able to read DOS files from Win7, IBM told me.  But SmartSuite itself, is able to run in Win7, per MS' own listing of 'compatible' programs.  So try buying here in Amazon, earlier versions of SmartSuite, which run between $6 - $50 (versions 9.8 and prior).  I'm testing those, so am writing reviews of SmartSuite as well (review is still in progress).  The latest version of SmartSuite can only be purchased at IBM, so far as I can tell, but it's still called version 9 (but is later than the versions sold here at Amazon).  The latest version costs about $400, so you'd be smart to get an earlier version here in Amazon, see if you like it.

For later versions of Word (or SmartSuite) can read Word 2000-2002 files, as well as files in other older programs for Windows (SmartSuite can read more older files, even from DOS).

Why is that important?  These older Windows programs thus become BRIDGE programs to enable later MS software to read word processing and spreadsheet software which is PRE-2000.  In short, you open those older files in Word/Excel 2000-2002, and then CONVERT them into Word/Excel 2000-2002.  At which point, later MS software can work with the same file.  Else, it's toast. So if you have many old files, you need Office XP 2000 or 2002, as a 'bridge' back to your old files.  So now the question:  WHICH?  2000, or 2002?  No simple answer. Depends on what Office products you're using now, and whether you use Acrobat. The rest of this review is on these complex questions.

WARNING:  Windows 7 will not work with Outlook 2000.  Lots of complaints about that, in MS Answers forums.  Problem with passwords;  they won't store in Outlook 2000, when operated in Windows 7, because Windows 7 no longer allows you to use email directly from your computer;  you have to use it in conjunction with Windows Live mail -- a horrible thing.  (Why MS keeps on wrecking its own older-but-good features, is beyond my comprehension.)

So if you're planning to use Outlook 2000 in Windows 7, DO NOT install it with email enabled.  Maybe then it will work in Windows 7, because people have told me they can get Office 2000 to work even in Windows 8, but without Outlook email enabled.  So maybe you can install it and only in the new Windows version, enable email?  I don't know, but it's worth a shot.

====== OFFICE 2000 versus 2002 ======

Office 2000 works best in Win98SE and XP Home.  Office 2002 runs better in XP Professional; because the service packs convert Office 2000 into Word 2002 -- with bugs. So if like I did, you then reinstall 2000 to get rid of the bugs, the reinstallation conflicts with the updates. So that problem is solved if you upgrade to Office version 2002.

BUT BEWARE:  select CUSTOM installation of 2002. If you're on Windows XP Professional OS, DO NOT UPGRADE OUTLOOK 2000 to 2002.  So don't install Outlook 2002, if you're using Outlook 2000.  That's what I did (see last three paragraphs of this review).

====== OUTLOOK 2000 versus later editions ======

Outlook 2000 still beats the competing PIM and other calendar management software 'out there' for Windows, if you have a lot of recurring events in your year, i.e., you are an tax accountant, actuary, tax lawyer who deals with annual IRS deadlines.  Outlook is too much hassle to use, unless you have a lot of legal or other deadlines which you must track annually.  Same would be said if you are a buyer or supplier of regular shipments.  Buggy and cumbersome though Outlook is, once you properly set it up for recurring events/appointments, they keep on going forever.  Holidays, not so good: the list is stale-dated after a few years;  it's a hassle to go to MS to update your holidays, but they do provide updated lists (current one runs 2007-2012).  I just don't use them, have a paper calendar for that stuff.

Here's how I use it:  your usage will of course differ, but you can tell the PATTERN, and then adapt for your needs.  Key here is RECURRING DEADLINES.  Everyone has recurring deatlines.  Outlook shines in that respect.  So (as stated again below), a) I keep a thin wireback 8.5 x 11 paper calendar for basics on holidays, and workload planning.  Easy to store in the files, easier then to get a sense of where to look for stuff in Outlook.  Next, b) I programmed legal deadlines in Excel based on the client year end, because in pensions you end up having six or seven separate deadlines a month, centering around the 15th  and the end of the month, based on the Plan or client fiscal year end.  It's a nightmare.  So that master list of deadlines based on year end, helps a great deal.  Finally, c) in Outlook I then plotted a generic calendar by year end, so the deadlines show as 'events' in my calendar each day, week, month.  So Outlook is a glorified alarm clock.  Hassle to program, but easier than using a PDA or cellphone.  (Sidekick is next best, but you can't really run it properly in a DOS window, after Win98SE.)

A client is likewise an 'event' keyed to that particular year end.  Because in my business, the penalties are high for missing deadlines.  IRS almost always forgives the penalty if you've good reason for being late, but no one wants to go through that angst.  Hopefully this paragraph gave you ideas you can extrapolate for your own usage.

You might want to know about printing.  You can print any configuration you'll likely want, but remember that the longer the timeline per print job, the smaller the font needs to be, and the harder it will be to get decent output.  Daily, weekly, monthly works well.  A whole year can be done, but it's not useful.  You can configure the day/week/month with filters to create a blank calendar.  But that will cost you more time than if you just bought one.

Frankly, you'll waste time to print calendars.  The minute you print them, you'll find something you need to change.  So better to go paperless, if you need something to distribute: for this, you print to pdf.  Lots of good pdf printers out there, and you probably already have one on your machine.  My favorite is Smart PDF Creator Pro, but I also have Acrobat 9 (the latter creates the smallest file size of any pdf print program I've seen).  So you 'print' to the pdf printer on your machine, saving paper, time and guilt when you find, five seconds later, that the format is screwy or you left something out.  Outlook also exports to devices:  here it might matter that you use Outlook 2003, depending on your device.  Many more devices are configured to interface with Outlook, than with the other PIM software 'out there'.  It's usually a hassle to set up the first few times, because the names in your device don't match the names in Outlook, so you go through trial-and-error finding out which OUTLOOK names 'port' to your device.  But in the end, it is worth the effort.

Frankly, the old At-A-Glance monthly or weekly calendars are great.  But the problem is, if you have a lot of complicated recurring items you'll later need to SEARCH for, the paper method is no good.  So I keep paper for just the basics (like holidays and planning out my workload), but record the details in Outlook.  Stuff done stays in Outlook forever if you want it to, and you can archive anything for any period, manually or automatically (pick manual, never trust MS automated anything).

Outlook 2000 is the best version.  It's 'views' are very configurable;  it's extremely buggy (as is true of all MS products), but is better than later versions of Outlook. On XP Home, Outlook 2002 will 'obey' the Outlook 2000 settings you have, but you lose future 'view' configurability.  Outlook 2003 will not recognize the Outlook 2000 settings on XP Home; nor will Outlook 2002 on XP Professional OS.  I don't know whether the settings will be recognized on Win7, since I won't upgrade to that terrible, new OS.  (Win 7 is still VISTA, but with some corrections.)

Outlook 2000 can display custom-sized and positioned units, all on the same 'page': tasks, calendar, etc.  For example, you can widen or narrow dimensions;  say, Notes and Tasks alongside a daily or weekly calendar.  Again, THE reason to get Outlook, is its ability to set recurring events, and link them to notes, tasks, and journalling.  Bugs all have workarounds.  Since this is software you'd use daily, you'll get used to the workarounds.

(Old Borland Sidekick, and the old Lotus Metro were less buggy, but also less configurable.  Forget WordPerfect's PIM.  All business contact management software, stinks.  Been there, done that, have the war wounds.)

By contrast, Outlook 2002 (in XP Pro) et seq. only allow one view at a time, Calendar OR Notes OR Tasks. You must open new windows to view, say, Notes and/or Tasks alongside each other; of course you must resize the windows each time. So you're constantly stuck with moving them around.

In short, the last viable version of Outlook, is 2000.  Part of its viability ports over when you upgrade in 2002 in XP Home; but only data is ported over for Outlook 2003, which is utterly dysfunctional.  For example, your 'contacts' begin with REAMS of BLANKS, and there is no option for NAME fields.  What drunk designed that ????  The only way you can deal with it is to sort DESCENDING, or GUESS how many BLANKS you must first delete before you can reach the 'A' in contacts.  God forbid you click on any of the letters (which are supposed to be address-book-tabs), and above all don't click on 123, because then you can't sort at all -- well, until you leave 'Contacts', at which point when you return, your names are necessarily bass-ackwards.  But at least then you can see how many BLANKS you have to delete, and then reset sort to ascending.  Still, you can't organize FIELDS in Contacts.  Oh, wait -- you can specify the fields, but you can't SEE them, and there is no 'current view' available listing NAMES first.  None of this hassle applied in older versions of Outlook.  Unbelievable.

But finally, Outlook 2003 allows you to specify a certain folder to open on startup (i.e., your calendar, instead of that useless Outlook Today with too much white space and no configurability).  In Outlook 2000, you specify this by selecting Tools Options Other Advanced Options button, then pick what you want to display at startup from the drop-down box. (Sorry for the arcane step names.  Clarity is not, an MS forte.)

Outlook 2003 imposes problems when editing tasks, i.e., the highlighter seems to be on one task though you've clicked on a different one, so you'll think you delete the HIGHLIGHTED one; but instead you deleted the task on which your CURSOR (not mouse), resides.

Something must be wrong with the water, in Redmond WA.

Outlook 2002 et seq, FORCE TWO LINES OF ICONS.  You can't uncheck that Options box. When installing In XP Professional, it crashes, then tells you it can't use your prior version settings or your store, would you like to use the default. If you say no, the program quits. If you say yes, it wipes out your prior settings, and you have to do them all over: that's a week's work.

Same 'week' cost is true for Outlook 2000, but when you get it configured rightly, it's a decent program;  it has a nice PDA transfer capability, is easy to import and export to other formats.

====== PHOTO EDITOR 2000 versus later editions ======

DO NOT UPGRADE THE PHOTO EDITOR, either.  The 2000 version is much more full-featured.  The 2002 replacement isn't bad, but it's not as good as the year 2000 version.

====== OTHER OFFICE PROGRAMS (excepting Word and Excel) ======

Business Contact Manager, Front Page, Power Point and Access are useless programs, all glitch and no gain.  You might need Access, though, as many other non-MS programs, use its structure and features.  MS Power Point can result in a pretty slide show, but in Windows Movie Maker you can do more, and more easily.  (Pity Microsoft is so short-sighted, it won't modernize WMM.  MS is losing profits, by not modernizing it.  Again, the MS programs that are actually USEFUL, get scant MS attention.  The programs we NEED to be useful as well but are so buggy you itch for a gun, are 'upgraded' to be more buggy, still.)

Document Imaging and Scanning is marginally better in Office 2002, can be quite useful.  The default tiff file is easy to manipulate, small in size, and most older scanners can thus 'talk' to MS Document Imaging (i.e., the Brother line of MFC).  You have to tweak the MS settings each time; but especially for older scanners and files, these programs are a godsend.  They are somewhat easier to use than Acrobat and PaperPort, but operate along much the same lines.  Like MS, Acrobat is phasing out backwards-compatibility.

====== WORD and EXCEL 2000 and 2002 versus later editions ======

Acrobat can't work with Word post-2002, though it claims compatibility.  It can't work with Word 2000, per its own website (see my review on Acrobat 9, here in Amazon.)

So that leaves Word 2002 and Excel 2002.  GET THEM, if you ever used Win98SE or even Win 3.1 -- and thus have old computer files from that time and prior.  Office 2002 is the last MS version to support backwards compatibility with the powerhouse software of yesteryear (Word Perfect, Quattro Pro, Lotus 1-2-3, Ami, etc).  Later versions ELIMINATE backwards-compatibility; and worse, impose a 'restriction policy' you can't override without screaming (see my review of Word 2003 in Amazon).

So you will need Office 2002 or 2000 to READ older files.  Moreover, older software CANNOT SEARCH the drive. WordPerfect through X5 cannot search its own files on a disk.  Only can search its own files within a directory of a disk.  Windows, by contrast, can't read WordPerfect files to search for text.  This was not a problem in 98SE, but is a problem now.  So if you don't have some 'bridge' software that CAN read those old files, you're stuck.

If you're on XP Professional OS, then old spreadsheets like Lotus 1-2-3 wk1's, must be converted via an older version of Excel; to enable a later version of Excel, to read the file.  In XP Home (but NOT Professional), Office 2003's Excel CAN read Lotus 1-2-3 files, but later versions of Excel, cannot;  because, in later versions, the wk1 format is deemed dangerous, and you can't fix the Excel default to accept that format.  So, you'd have to convert the wk1 to an Excel format. This is especially true, if you want your family/friends/clients to read wk1 files.

Any version of Office is mediocre, buggy; what automation they should allow, they prohibit.  What automation they impose, wrecks your work. For example, DEFAULTS at installation involve 'autoformat' and 'update style', which on the surface, sound harmless and even beneficial. But if you don't spend hours examining and unchecking these and other defaults prior to creating an important document, you'll have regrets.

Example: say you install, didn't check the defaults, and start to write a document. You create bulleted lists. When you've reached page 18, you decide to reformat the indentation and type of bullets on THAT page.  YOU think you're only changing the format of the latest bullet list.  Surprise surprise -- ALL your previous bulleted lists, ALSO changed to CONFORM to your latest 'auto update style'.

So everything's bass-ackwards with MS software:  before you do anything, you must carefully review every default setting, and figure out how to change it.

So TURN OFF ALL AUTOMATED FUNCTIONS just after installation.  Before you create any document, call up each program and examine its Options and Customize and Autoformat.  It will take all day to figure out what you must turn off or on. Then hit the SAVE (floppy disk) icon to save, without naming the document/spreadsheet.  For that first document/spreadsheet which comes up, is the DEFAULT.  Word's default is Normal.dot, and Excel's default is Book1.xls.  But you won't see the former's name when you open Word;  instead, it labels as Doc1.doc;  but it IS, Normal.dot.  So make your changes to the Options (including Color, for Excel), then hit the SAVE (floppy disk) icon to save it IN the default.

So always have a backup copy before you edit in Word or Excel 2002.  Never trust that what you edited, was all that changed.  Read the entire document over.

What about their vaunted templates?  Yecccch.  And what if you design one of your own?  Well, here's the problem: you can't SEE the formatting so if you backspace, you just wiped it out.  Thankfully, there's 'Reveal Formatting' (in 'Format' menu, or separately moveable as an icon -- tricky thing to create it).  So if your Formatting is REVEALED (by a frame on the right side of your document) -- as you type, you can see what formatting is used for that line.  This is far better than Word Perfect's stupid Reveal Codes, but the latter at least smartly warns if you're deleting a 'style' or 'format'; or (at least in WP 9) flat presumes you only mean to delete text.  Now if only WP would get rid of auto-formatting for a printer hooked up to your system...

Word is not so smart.  It could be MADE to be smart, if they souped up their current option to 'show formatting marks' to INCLUDE the style identifiers.  So you can't see the STYLE, except via Reveal Formatting' frame at right of your document.

It is easy to change and add styles, but spend the hour or two it takes to figure out how to add those styles to Normal.dot, because a changed style only 'stays' with the document you edit.  Same problem is true for Excel, but Excel allows you to always COPY to and from Book1.xls, as you work.  This matters a bunch, for MS default colors are egregious.  In Excel but not Word, you can change the colors, save them to Book1.xls, and then 'copy' them into whatever other worksheet you later open.  Else, any colors you change (using Tools Options Color tab), are only good for that worksheet and maybe for that SESSION.  (It's quirky: sometimes my Tools Options Colors modifications for a worksheet; save; and sometimes not, though I always go through the same steps, and have been doing this for years.)

=== OTHER TIPS ===

A.  In Word, check the box in General tab which asks to be prompted to update the default template, 'Normal.dot'.  Else, any changes you make in program function (i.e., icons or options), won't be preserved once you close the program.  Similarly, if you goofed up your settings during a session, when prompted to update at close program, you can select 'no'; thus your goofups won't be saved. :)

B.  Word is notorious for not enabling underlined blanks.  So to make blank underlined spaces, select Tools Options, then select the Compatibility tab, and check off 'draw underline on trailing spaces'.  Then hit the 'default' button at lower right, and click Yes.  You've just enabled underlined blanks in all future documents. To enable them in past documents: repeat the foregoing steps, after having opened each such other document.  The other way to do it, is to tap out your spaces, end them with punctuation, then paint UP TO the punctuation mark you made.  Word will then draw the underline -- BECAUSE that punctuation mark is on the same line.  Weird.

C.  Comments in Word are incredibly stupid.  You're better off making footnotes or endnotes or objects, since you can optionally hide these from printing.  Bookmarks are a great alternative, since you can bookmark a section, so when the person clicks on it, can be redirected to the comment on some page not to be printed, then use the 'Web' Menu's back or forward buttons, to return back to where he was reading.  Comments in Excel are even more stupid, and no matter how you set them, a) you can't set a DEFAULT NOTE STYLE so are stuck with the ungainly defaults the stupid programmers impose; b) every time you load the worksheet, when you go to EDIT the comments, your comment on edit might be MILES AWAY from the cell (though anchored to the cell, properly readable as a comment).  I've spent hours slowly moving some edited comment which is anchored, say, to column E, but when opened for edit is somehow suddenly the size of a thin line, and way over in column FN, where no worksheet cells are active.  Doesn't matter whether you set the comment to move and resize with the cell, or move but not resize (no reason NOT to move the comment for a cell).  Each single comment must be individually formatted, but all formatting options are available.

D. In Excel, to make the Print Preview show color, select a PDF printer in Page Setup, and make sure that 'black and white' is NOT checked in Page Setup Sheet tab.  This enables you to print to pdf file, and keep the colors.  A black-and-white printer will print colors as shades, anyway.  So you don't need to do anything special.  (Older printers couldn't print shades, so the 'black-and-white' option in Page Setup Sheet is something of a holdover.  Any laser printer I've worked with, naturally recognizes color as a shade of gray.  If you have a color printer, generally you won't want to print black-and-white, either, as black ink is more expensive for color printers.)

E.  Editing text in Excel actually allows you full formatting options.  Edit in the formula bar, and when you want to bold or color or highlight only a specific portion of the text, then do it like you would in Word: select the text then pick whatever formatting you want to apply to the selection.  You can also conditionally format cells, but it's buggy and limited.  3-D type function is easy enough, where in one tab you reference another worksheet by tab name -- what's hard, is that the instructions don't make it clear, how to do this.  It's TABNAME!Cellname  -- be sure to include the exclamation.  Cellname can be either a named range or an address.  If a named range, be sure you've allowed 'accept labels in formulas', in the Tools Options Calculation tab. This is especially important if you're importing a spreadsheet with named ranges (i.e., from Lotus 1-2-3).  If you don't allow those 'labels', ALL YOUR NAMED RANGES ARE CONVERTED TO CELL ADDRESSES INSTEAD, AND YOU CANNOT RENAME THEM.  So says Excel help.  I've not tested that warning for accuracy.

F.  Else, in either 2000 or 2002, the footnotes, endnotes, section headers, table of contents, etc. are cumbersome but useful.  The 'styles' are quirky;  sometimes a backspace while working on a document, undoes or changes the style to something bizarre.  Bookmarks are handy. Customize your icons, to save time later.  In Word/Excel 2002, they insanely group the icons so that too much space is used.  So to end that problem, you must move the icons around to make them fit in the top window line (next to 'Help');  then, fit the rest of the icons so that they only take up ONE line. This fixing, takes hours.  Again, the stupid DEFAULTS pay no attention to customer need, usage, or even common sense.

G.  Word can't merge well with a database.  Comma-delimited or a text file is all it really knows.  But WordPerfect, is even more cumbersome and glitchy.  After years of trying to get either program to merge well, I fell back to my old DOS Multimate Advantage II.  I use old DOS Sidekick on a 486, to create a paste file which then runs the merge.  There ought to be a way to do the same thing in either Word or WordPerfect, but I've not found it.  (IBM's SmartSuite version 9.8 backwards, claim to enable real merging with a named range in a spreadsheet, even with DOS Lotus 1-2-3.  I'm testing that claim, now.  Will post its results in my SmartSuite review here in Amazon.)

====== SUMMARY AND INSTALLATION TIPS ======

SUMMING UP: On the whole, Office 2002 or 2000 is good enough for basic functions like a letter or a simple spreadsheet; for pretty colors but minimal functionality. Excel's ability to do complex calculations -- especially with dates -- is awful. However -- very ironic -- if you programmed the functions in DOS Lotus 1-2-3, the pre-2003 versions of Excel recognize them correctly, and suddenly can handle dates and other complex calculations.  In short, to make Exel really excel, you need DOS Lotus.  (Oddly, Lotus Release 3-5 for Windows, can't handle these calculations well.  SmartSuite did seem to recognize/calculate the functions correctly, when I uploaded a DOS Lotus 1-2-3 worksheet into SmartSuite version 9.6 and 9.1.)

Hence the need for Office 2002 or 2000, in order to 'read' your wk1 files, and make Excel, useful.  (Years ago I begged IBM to re-release DOS Lotus 1-2-3 -- they own its rights, now -- and never got an answer.  So the only way you can get DOS 1-2-3 version 2.x, is to buy it from the secondary market, i.e., some 'vintage software' warehouse.  Check here in Amazon, maybe someone's selling it.)

Again, Office 2002 runs more smoothly than 2000, in XP Pro;  but Outlook in 2002 is inflexible, compared to the 2000 version.  There are also more add-ins created for 2000.  Another flipside: 2002 is compatible with Acrobat 9 and X, but 2000 is not.  Not to worry: buy Smart PDF Creator Pro, which can what Adobe can do for a much lower price; and will work with these older MS Office programs.  So I just use Smart PDF Creator Pro with pre-2002 MS Office (and anything else).

Also, get the CONVERTERS, so that 2002 (or 2000) can read and use LATER versions of Word and Excel (like xlsx and docx extensions).  The converters do work.  Google on fileconverters.exe , to get the download from Microsoft.  That's its program name.

So now you're looking at a hybrid installation, Word 2002 and Excel 2002, but older versions of Outlook and Photo. On XP Pro OS, I installed Office 2003, over 2000; then uninstalled 2003, because it's so clunky and dysfunctional; then installed 2002; then uninstalled Outlook 2002, then reinstalled ONLY Outlook 2000 (to a different directory).  Works well, and all my overrides of the defaults, still work.  Will do the same for Photo 2000, later.  I always prefer the full version of the software to upgrades.  I hope you know, that even the upgrade version IS a full version.  But then you might have copyright concerns later.  Best to buy each 'upgrade' as a full version, so you can continue to separately use the old version, on some other machine.  Here, you've seen how that might be needful.

Alternative is to have one machine with 2000, and the other with 2002.  So my XP Pro machine, has the above hybrid;  my XP Home OS netbook, still has Office 2003; which was installed over Office 2000.  My other XP Home desktop, has Office 2002 installed over 2000.  And an old Win98SE laptop, still has 2000.  In short, to assure backwards-compatibility, I have multiple computers from 286 forward;  these run on DOS, Win98SE, XP.  And in case I need it, I have the older programs, too -- like Lotus, Multimate, Word Perfect, Word 97, etc.  Still have Win95 OS, too.  Even, Win 3.1 and 3.11.

This way, you can read files from older software going all the way back to the 1980's.  You know: when Noah was born. :)",3
"From what I can tell, this is the non-alcoholic version of Crest's ""Invigorating Clean Mint"" mouthwash.  Instead of the alcohol, which is a natural (and tasty) preservative, you get parabens.  The user should be aware of this, as some people claim they cause cancer (I'm too uninformed about that topic to state an opinion, but some people might wish to look into it).

Amazingly, this actually tastes very good, whereas every non-alcoholic mouthwash I've ever had before (mostly in hotels) has been horrible.  The ironic thing is that it says they don't use alcohol so that you don't get that burn.  Despite the fact that the burn is what makes me feel like it's doing its job, there is more burn in this than the version with the alcohol!  Admittedly, that burn is slightly different.

Seems like a good mouthwash.",4
"The mouthwash burn sensation in the Crest Pro-Health mouthwashes is stronger than in some of the other Crest formulas, but is similar to the Scope mouthwash burn. I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to the mouthwash burn, so the strength of it is usually the first thing I notice when trying out a new mouthwash. My husband who seems immune to the strength of every mouthwash out there, seems fine with this Crest formula and has no problem washing with it. I haven't had any issues with this mouthwash turning my teeth colors or causing any kind of build, and neither has my mouthwash addicted husband. So it seems to work well. It leaves your breath smelling great and lasts quite a while. I like this wintergreen version a bit more than the mint, since I've always been a fan of the more refreshing taste of wintergreen.

One thing I do appreciate is that Crest did not use Yellow #5 food coloring to make this mouthwash, since most companies use that color to produce the green hue in their products (including Scope). Some people, myself included, have a sever food allergy to Yellow #5 and can't use or eat anything with that food coloring it it. For those with this condition, note that Crest has used Yellow #6 instead to create the mouthwashes green color. The Crest Pro-Heath mouth wash in the Invigorating Clean version, which is an even greener colored mouthwash, also doesn't use Yellow #5, and used #6. So anyone with this food coloring sensitivity who wants to try these out, can do so knowing these won't have Yellow #5 in them.",4
"I am reviewing this on behalf of my boyfriend who is the lucky user of this electric shaver. He still insists that razor a blade gives a closer shave and I agree, the skin is a lot smoother and clearer but this is great for the weekends when he wants to get rid of the stubble and not scratch my face off. This enables him to get a smooth feeling on the skin without stripping and irritating it, and no creams and products are needed. The 3 rotating heads really adjust to the contour of the face and they snap open for easy clean up with water. I've seen him use it and it's a cinch, fast, easy and no mess!

Overall this is a great product, it works well and the face feels and looks good afterwards and it takes very little time to use. Better than shaving when it comes to comfort but my man still prefers the razor when he has to shave for work. This makes a great holiday gift, a gadget that people wouldn't run out and buy for themselves necessarily and fun to have as an option in the morning.

"You know how annoying it is to keep in mind that every 30-45 days you must throw away your old toothbrush and then find the same kind with the same either soft or medium head and it is never exactly the same and you have to get used to it again and then whole cycle repeats itself?

Well, no more. I have an automatic toothbrush and all I do now is put its head in this neat sanitizer and it kills all the bacteria and I can go on for another 20-30 days without having to worry about repeating this process. The product has UV bulb, which is what actually kills the bacteria. There is an extra brush head holder for different models of brush heads (Oral-B-FlexiSoft and FlossAction and most Sonicare models). I didn't have troubles putting the holder into the Sanitizer. The cleaning takes approximately 10 minutes and when complete it shuts itself off. It was prebuilt with a drip tray to get rid of excess water. This is a great gift for anyone in your family. Folks, it doesn't get any easier or more practical than this.",4
"I've been experimenting with various homemade cleaning product recipes and liquid castile soap seems to be a staple.  I like the famous Dr. Bronner's stuff, but wasn't feeling up to paying for it.  Dr. Woods, however, seems to provide as respectable a soap as one could ask for.  While any real faults in any of my experiments are probably due to the recipe itself, this ingredient has reacted as expected and I got to say I've had some great results.  When using this soap on its own, I've been impressed as well.  The almond aroma is not overwhelming, but clean and natural.  I've seen some reviews complaining this doesn't sud well, but I have no complaints there.  It rinses completely as well with no surface residue.  What causes me to most to recommend this soap is the price.  I find this a great buy.",4
"I was surprised that the tools have in this kit are full sized.  My experience of mani-pedicure kits has been tiny little toys that are cute but useless.  I'm putting this kit in my travel bag, so I'll never leave on a trip without it.

This kit is a bit too bulky to throw in a purse; I carry huge purses, and it's still too big.  I also think it's not really practical for an office; how many opportunities in an average office are there to give yourself the kind of pedicure in which toe separators and a callous file would be involved?

Still, this is almost the perfect travel kit.  It's a great start, and there's plenty of room in the storage bag for add-ins, like cuticle remover, a bottle of polish, and some polish remover wipes.",4
"This review is for the ""Urban Spa Boucle Bath Mitt For Shower, Bath, Exfoliating and Cleansing"" - basically a bath mitt with a natural boucl yarn.
You only get one mitt which has a soft exfoliating surface that is less harsh than a loofah yet still exfoliates effectively.

The mitt is thin and it fits my hand normally if not a little loose. I have large hands.  I was perplexed by all the reviews about these being small.  Maybe this points to a QC issue?

It performs well in the shower - gently abrasing skin.  I use it with a high quality body wash.

Overall - this is a decent mitt but nothing spectacular.  I've used products from my local stores that are as good or better for perhaps less price.  It does work and it does leave my skin feeling soft and refreshed.  I would recommend it with reservations.",4
"I have many tools to help me keep my feet soft in the summer time.  When I wear sandals all day, my heels can get ruff and dry looking so I feel it is important to take proper care of them.  My overall impression of this buffing brush was light way and perhaps not super expensive.  I didn't feel much of a grit difference between the two sides of the brush, I wish one side was grittier than the other side.  I did feel like overall it did a nice job on my heels and pad of my foot.  I typically like to use these dry but you can also use this one wet.  I have used about 4 times and overall the grit is holding up fairly well compared to other files that I have purchased before.",4
"As a shaving cream, this performs well.  It's moisturizing and it washes off without leaving residue.  It works even with razors that are kind of dull (which is good, because I forget to change my razor out as often as I should) -- I didn't cut myself at all.

Because this isn't a foaming product, you do have to use more than you would with some competing products.  I found it non-irritating, too.  (You can see the full ingredients list if you scroll down the main product page.)

This does have a strong smell.  I kind of like it, but I have heard from plenty of people who detest the scent.  It's an artificial blueberry sort of scent.  So if you have reactions to strong fragrances, you may want to stay away.",4
"If you share a bathroom with a female, be it a wife, girlfriend, daughter, are roommate, you know what a loofa is because it is most likely hanging from your shower head right now.  And the Axe Detailer Shower Tool is basically a loofa marketed to guys.  The only thing different from the female in your life's besides the color scheme is the flip side that has a rougher scrubber on it for tougher places on your body like the feet, elbows, etc., but that side just feels like an afterthought and I found myself cleaning those areas with the scrubbing side after awhile.  In the end the Ax Shower Tool does get the job done and basically you need to ask yourself, ""Do I want another loofa hanging on my showerhead?""",4
"Finally seeing results.  But don't get the wrong idea.  This result-delay is probably not a CLEAN & CLEAR problem.  For some reason our teen boy thought he should use this cleanser  without a washcloth... AND apparently a washcloth is an extremely important part of getting the upper hand on breakouts.

The Backstory
Our boy is 14 and is having to begin shaving several times a week. (Somehow it doesn't seem right that our baby is shaving. sigh.)  This shaving is aggravating his breakouts taking them up a level.  We got this Clean & Clear Cleanser to see what results we could get with an over the counter product.  After a week and a half there wasn't (initially) enough improvement so we made an appointment with a dermatologist.

We've since CANCELLED that appointment because I happened to watch boy wash his face one night. No Wash Cloth.  I smacked my forehead and took the time to show him how to properly wash his face.  Apparently this is a thing guys don't all know.  It's been a week since the demonstration (which included a mention that you don't scrub your face fiercely. That the skin there is delicate, particularly under the eyes....)  and his face is looking really good.  I suspect in another few days even the small spots will be gone.

SUMMING IT  UP
This is working for us.  If you've got  younger teen using it, I highly recommend making sure that they know what they should be doing.  Don't assume they read the directions, even if they read everything else that crosses their path.

No irritation, easy to use, and the salicylic acid is working to make considerable changes in his complexion.",4

Both sudz up nicely with body wash and should work well with salt or sugar scrubs as well. It is easy to slip on and has a handy loop for hanging and drying in the shower.

The natural bamboo and jute mitt is a little small on my hand (6ft tall man) but it works. It should be fine on smaller hands. I'm a hairy guy and some of my body hair does attach itself to the mitt even after thoroughly rinsing and wringing out. That doesn't bother me, but it might limit shareablity with my wife. I also worry that over time it might get a musty smell since it takes a while to dry, but as long as I keep using it with soap, I hope that it won't be an issue.

"I think I may be in the minority here. I really love the ""clean"" feel of Listerine (a product that is heavily endorsed by my dentist and hygienist), and genuinely missed it here. But I also use ACT ... so, I am used to products that don't necessarily provide that exciting tingle (my dentist has me use Listerine in the morning and ACT before bed). So, I replaced my Listerine with this and while my mouth didn't feel as excitingly clean, it claims to protect enamel, so that might be a nice bonus.

After this bottle is gone, I plan on returning to Listerine (I supposed it is a part of my routine now ... and I am always loathe to deviate from the course of action my dentist plans for me). However, this seems to do no harm and could be great for those with a low-threshold for strong products like Listerine (there is a person in my family who does not use Listerine because they find it painful ... this would be ideal for her). So, if this is you, give it a try. (If you like it, then consult your dentist).",4
"My teen has been using this mouthwash for about two years.  I'm not sure why but both of my children have had a problem with cavities.  I believe it's because we have well water which isn't fluoridated.  We have always been brushers.

My son I can't quite get used to using the mouthwash, but my daughter does and I'm sure it's the non-alcoholic nature of the wash that makes it acceptable as it's not that sting-y.

SUMMARY
Since my young teenagers are using this mouthwash I wanted one without alcohol.  My daughter uses it on a regular basis and for about two years.  It's impossible to say whether the mouthwash has worked or if the kids are just flossing and brushing more effectively, but they have had fewer cavities and improved dental reports.",4
"My 12 year old just got braces for the first time and the procedure to floss between his teeth was never going to happen. So the orthodontist recommended getting a Waterpik instead.

After looking at all the models, we choose this one. It holds a lot of water. It has storage in the lid for all the attachments, and it seemed easy to use.

I looked at the ones that were battery powered but I didn't think they would hold enough water and I couldn't see him refilling it to finish. This model has a big range of pressure that changes quickly with the turn of a dial. it does have to be plugged in and the handle is connected by a water tube. This does limit the distance from the unit to the mouth but it is more than enough if you are standing at a vanity.

There is a huge variety of tips but I don't think we will be using more than two or three. I actually wish that there were two or three of the basic tips for multiple family members instead of some of the other fancy tips.

The tips pop on and off easily and there is a 'pause' button on the handle that allow you to shut the water spray off quickly. This way, you can turn it on, position it in your mouth and then start the water spray.

It is not a clean process. It is almost impossible to use this without splashing water at some point.

The bottom line is that it does what it promises and my son has been using it. We'll see how good his teeth are when the braces come off in two years...",4
"The perfect, complete package for that person that needs an electric toothbrush.  Complete with toothpaste, floss and mouthwash, this would be a great gift.

The toothbrush has 5 settings, and it lists them in the description.  I prefer the sensitive setting, as I recently had gum surgery and am now very aware of how hard I am brushing, which leads me into that nice feature.  This toothbrush will slow and the red light will come on if you are brushing too hard.  I like that, because it reminds me to use lighter pressure.  It comes with a separate display that keeps track of how long you are brushing, and also has a clock.  The brush pauses when it is time to switch sides.  I like the carrying case, as you can place the unit and the separate brushes in it.

I think it is a bit much with the display, personally.  The separate display portion is kind of a hassle.  I also wish it had a setting memory.  Every time you restart the toothbrush, it starts over at the first setting, so I have to press the arrow down to get to the sensitive setting.  It takes about 7 seconds, so you have wasted that time with the brush out of your mouth, trying to find the correct setting you like.

I like it, it works well, there are just a few things I would prefer be different.  I prefer a little more of a simplistic toothbrush.",4
"I'll come clean here ... I totally thought this was a leave-in. I had never heard of a ""mousse-style"" rinse-out conditioner. Luckily, I read the back before even hopping into the shower.  Now, I think the scent may be polarizing. For me, it translated as ""pleasant"" and ""clean"" (I thought it smelled like a blend of citrus and mint, which I found to be a very refreshing fragrance). I think because I gravitate towards the uncommon, this registered as very likeable. Now, I definitely used WAY too much the first time. (I think I just enjoyed the texture and the experience. LOL!) So, just be careful of that. Finally, it is easy to distribute and rinsed super clean. My only concern is any potential rust from the canister. I usually leave my shampoo and conditioner in the shower area ... but I was worried that this container could stain my tub/shower (I had done this accidentally with a shave cream many years ago). So, I find myself taking this into the shower and carrying it out of the shower ... and occasionally forgetting it, wrapping a towel around me and going to grab it. I guess, I'm flummoxed by metal containers in the shower.

Understand, the conditioning aspect is very light (so as to allow for volume and movement), so if you have damaged hair, this may not be the best choice. However, it certainly does leave plenty of bounce. By all means, it does what it claims!",4
"This product is dispensed from an aerosol can. On the face of it I thought it was a mousse product. Fortunately, I read the instructions. While the product didn't indicate that the can needed to be shaken, I shook it and then dispensed a small amount in the palm of my hand and worked it through my towel dried hair. I left it on for 3 minutes and then rinsed thoroughly. I lightly towel dried my hair again and blow dried my hair with a rounded hair brush starting at the roots. My hair looked as though it had more volume, but I subsequently repeated the process this morning and applied my regular mousse before styling. My hair looked better despite the initial benefits of just this conditioner alone.",4
"This Fekkai Foam Conditioner is unusual for a foam in that the directions say to apply to wet hair after washing, wait 2 - 3 minutes and then rinse out. Normally foam conditioners are left in the hair and then dried and styled as usual. In fact, that's what I did the first time. It worked pretty well but left just a slight bit of heaviness to my fine hair.  Then I read the directions which I should have done before using it. The next couple times I used it as instructed and I liked the results better. It seemed to add a little volume and body to my fine hair. It didn't do a super job of detangling though. The foam is very full and luxurious. The dispensing mechanism is nice because it puts quite a large amount in your hand with only a light touch. It makes it very easy to use.

I love the fragrance which smells like fresh grapefruit and citrus. It's very natural scent, not like something cooked up in a lab. It's one of my favorite things about the product. After drying my hair the fragrance went away so I wouldn't have to worry about it conflicting with my cologne.",4
"First off - I love the scent. A hint of flower and mint makes a great combination that doesn't overpower and is gone by the time I leave the door in the morning.

I do have very fine hair and this works great. I wouldn't recommend it for thick hair - you'd have to use far too much of it. But for thin hair that gets limp fast if the product has too much wax/silicates, this gives volume without weighing down hair.  I didn't have to use a lot of styling products afterwards that always seem to make my thin hair stiffen and flatten.

A small ball rapidly expands as you put it in your hair, so a little goes a lot way.  I use this on days when I need a bit of extra conditioning - for meetings and such.  It is more expensive than store bought conditions but on par with salon varieties.  And I do trust the Fekkai name.",4
"Easy to apply with minimal prep involved (you basically affix a strip to the tooth in need of soothing and let it sit for 10 minutes) these strips are good for medium grade and below tooth sensitivity issues. As far as results go your mileage will vary but I do have one tooth in particular with mild, persistent issues whenever it comes into contact with ice. The strip does tone done the sensation by approximately 50% in my estimation so not necessarily an insta-cure but good enough to be noticeable.

Couple of things to keep in mind - each strip is very small and will cover 1 or 2 teeth each. The strips also do not 'stick' very well to the tooth so you'll need to be patient during the 10 minutes of application and try not to talk or move your mouth around. Also, I really like the convenience of having each strip individually packed making it easy to keep one in your bag/wallet while you're out and about should you ever need one.",4
These strips work to numb pain or cold sensitivity on teeth where the gum exposes a tiny bit of the dentin at the base of the tooth. Sometimes acidic foods can irritate this area and cause sensitivity. These strips are very easy to use. You just press one of the straps against the tooth and gum that is hurting and leave it in place for 10 minutes. I was really surprised that this actually worked and continued to work for several days. I am on the seventh day now and my tooth feels just slightly sensitive again. I do eat a lot of acidic foods and drink kombucha which is kind of sour so that may contribute to the strips not lasting as long. But I still think they offer a definite benefit and start to work quickly. It Is a product that I will keep on hand from now on.,4
"These consist of a wide, rather hard and sharp, plastic strip with a small stripe of gel on one side. You place one in your mouth on the gum line, outside of the tongue area, next to the aching tooth and leave in place for ten minutes. The instructions do not say to trim the plastic strip to fit, but in actual use, it was necessary to trim the strip in order to get the strip in place and have a comfortable fit for an aching  lower molar.

These worked very well, my son (30 years old, lives with me because he is disabled) had a tooth ache two weeks ago, we used one of these and his tooth hasn't bothered him since, but it was awkward to put in place, after one failed attempt of him trying to put a strip, we resorted to trimming the wide plastic strip before removing the backing and I put on a pair of disposable medical gloves and put the strip in for him.

I highly recommended the product and think it would be a great addition to any home medicine cabinet or first aid kit",4
"I noticed a difference the next day, after I used these.  I used it on one side of my mouth, on my lower back teeth which is the most sensitive spot in my mouth.  The next day, I put cold water in there and swished it around.  It was still sensitive, but I didn't have the screaming sensitivity that I usually have.  I think with continued use, this can dramatically minimize the sensitivity.

The strips are kind of hard to get off the sheet.  I wasn't sure if I was doing it right, and there weren't any instructions.  You have a big sheet of plastic with a little piece of the sensitivity strip in the middle.  You have to peel that part off, but it doesn't come off easily.  It is a little tricky to do.  I didn't notice a taste.  You aren't supposed to eat or drink for 30 minutes after you use them and you only leave them on for 10 minutes.

I am going to try these a week before my next dental cleaning, in January.  If I notice a difference, I will come back and change my review to 5 stars, and you will all be hearing about it!  For now, I recommend giving these a try.",4
"A few years ago I was head butted by a pit bull while volunteering at an animal shelter. No damage according to my dentist but I do suffer from occasional sensitivity in the area where I was hit. I've used specialized toothpaste but the transient nature of the sensitivity makes it hard to justify.  These tabs do seem to provide relief. They are small and adhere without issue. Leave them on for ten minutes and abstain from eating or drinking for another half hour. The effect is supposed to last for up to a month.

So far these have provided relief and  are as effective as the toothpastes. They don't cover a large area and it takes some dexterity to get them in harder to reach places. I would check with a dentist first to make sure the problem tooth isn't crack or cavity. But all in all, a fast and effective way to get some relief from sensitivity.",4
"Since a conditioner affects your hair differently based on its unique qualities, I will first state that my hair is very long, thick, wavy, soft, and aging (I'm 50). It is not color treated. I have some flyaway hair and split ends, but nothing too overwhelming. My main concerns are shine enhancement/retention, ease of combing out, and body retention. My hair can take some pretty heavy conditioning without flattening out.

This conditioner left my hair very soft and made it easy to comb through my wet hair after shampooing and conditioning. It's creamy and thick so you don't need a large amount for coverage, even with relatively voluminous hair. While this didn't do too much to enhance shine, it didn't dull what I already had. I found that it smoothed hair a little less (some ""frizzy"" parts) than some conditioners in the lower portions (despite my attention to even distribution) and did a better job smoothing the top. It did not suppress the natural waves my hair has or weigh it down.

All in all, I think this is a pretty good conditioner, but it may work better for someone with younger hair who doesn't need so much in the way of shine enhancement.",4
"I was a little disappointed in this soap because it just didn't have a strong enough Patchouli scent.
If you like to keep scented soaps in your lingerie drawer for a short time before using them to wash with, take this soap and go straight to the shower or bath.
That old fashioned way of scenting your clothes won't work with this one.
You will, however, really appreciate it in terms of cleaning your skin without stripping down all of the natural oils that keep us nice and soft. Patchouli is also a terrific scent for any gender. Even though the fragrance is not strong, a light Patchouli does come across while you're bathing.
The generously-sized bar lasts a nice long time.",4
"I have another brand of bar soap with a much more potent patchouli fragrance.  I had hoped that I would be able to bury my nose in this bar from Pre de Provence and imagine that I had just opened a bottle of patchouli essential oil.  No, no, it did not happen.  While it is a lovely fragrance, it is somewhat meek and mild.  Maybe that is what you are looking for, but I wanted deep, true, powerful patchouli.

With this bar from Pre de Provence I do get rich, smoothing and soothing moisturizing.  It was opportune that I had recently purchased two bars of soap from Plantlife, patchouli and sandalwood.  Oh, my!  Those fragrances are potent and wonderful!  Way more so than those from Pre de Provence.  Having the two patchouli bars at the same time allowed me to see the moisturizing qualities of both soaps.  The Plantlife dried my skin.  This Pre de Provence always left my skin soft and supple.  It was a BIG difference; so easy to see when I had the two together.

So, when it comes to the patchouli and the sandalwood soaps, which one you would like better depends on what you are looking for in a soap:  True potent fragrance or moisturizing luxury.  For me it boils down to my skin's needs in the cooler, drier months, and that means I go with the Pre de Provence.

If you do want to try the Plantlife patchouli, this is it:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Patchouli-100-Pure-amp-Natural-Aromatherapy-Herbal-Soap-4-oz-113g/dp/B000146LKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Patchouli 100% Pure & Natural Aromatherapy Herbal Soap- 4 oz (113g)</a>.  Maybe you might be interested in an Italian bar soap put out by Pre de Provence.  It has a mix of patchouli and rosewood and bergamot:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Via-Mercato-Italian-Soap-Bar-200g-No-1-Patchouli-and-Rosewood/dp/B01JPVO2DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Via Mercato Italian Soap Bar (200g), No. 1 - Patchouli and Rosewood</a>.  It has a lovely, intriguing and subtle fragrance.

A word on the size of this bar:  I have long fingers, so this large 250g size is not awkward in my hand.  But I can easily see that it might be a problem for smaller hands.  There is patchouli in the 200g size, but not the 150g.  Here is the link:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pre-de-Provence-Shea-Butter-Enriched-Artisanal-French-Soap-Bar-200-g-Traditional-Fragrance-Patchouli/dp/B000HLEY68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pre de Provence Shea Butter Enriched Artisanal French Soap Bar (200 g), Traditional Fragrance - Patchouli</a>.",4
"I love Pre de Provence bar soaps, and I love sandalwood.  By reading lots of reviews, I notice that many people do not like potent scents, and prefer light, delicate or unobtrusive fragrances.  I am not one of them.  I don't particularly like heavy, sweet and cloying scents, but I do love to breathe in intense, true fragrances.  (I say all this not to disrespect those who like unscented or light scents, but to let you know where my rating is coming from.)

I wanted to take a deep breath with my nose right up on this large bar of sandalwood and be able to say, ""Ahhh, sandalwood!""  No, that did not happen.  Yes, the sandalwood fragrance is there, but there are other scents as well, and together, it all gentles down the sandalwood.  It is a lovely soap, but not the sandalwood fragrance I was hoping for.

I have a bar of Plantlife Sandalwood soap that I bought about six weeks ago,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sandalwood-100-Pure-Natural-Aromatherapy-Herbal-Soap-4-oz-113g/dp/B00112DRHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sandalwood 100% Pure & Natural Aromatherapy Herbal Soap- 4 oz (113g)</a>.  It has way more sandalwood fragrance than this Pre de Provence.  But, interestingly, I noticed something when I traded that bar for the Pre de Provence:  While the Plantlife has the fragrance, Pre de Provence has the moisturizers.  When using the Pre de Provence, I definitely noticed that my legs, feet, arms, hands were not dry.  As soon as I went back to the Plantlife--just one day--that soap dried out my skin.

So, depends on what you are looking for in your soap.  If you want the intense fragrance, choose Plantlife, and give up soft and smooth skin.  I found both to give great lather, but only the Pre de Provence gave moisture.

A word about the size of this 250g bar:  If you have long fingers or large hands, you will be able to grasp this bar easily.  If you have small hands, you might be better off with the 200g bar,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pre-de-Provence-Shea-Butter-Enriched-Artisanal-French-Soap-Bar-200-g-Traditional-Fragrance-Sandalwood/dp/B001UFZOMS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pre de Provence Shea Butter Enriched Artisanal French Soap Bar (200 g), Traditional Fragrance - Sandalwood</a>, or the soap on a rope,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pre-de-Provence-Soap-On-a-Rope-Sandalwood-200-Gram/dp/B074QWY7CG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pre de Provence Soap On a Rope, Sandalwood, 200 Gram</a>.

"Oh my, this is one of the soaps I new arrived the moment I opened my mailbox because I could smell it already.  Then I took it out of the package, put it in my soap holder in my bathroom and when I went to bed at night, I could smell it just walking up my stairs.  The strength of the smell did die down after a couple days.  And about putting it in my soap holder, this bar is so big it barely even fit, much bigger than your standard bar for better or worse.  Better in that it will likely last almost twice as long.  Worse in that it is almost too big to hold (and probably is for people with small hands; I will not name names).  I guess I never put much thought into what Pomegranate smelled like, and now that I have taken a long strong whiff of it, I cannot say it is my favorite smell.  But more importantly it does leave me feeling clean without drying my skin and that is really all you can ask of your soap.",4
"I tend to be the sort of person who just buys the cheapest soap with the lightest scent available rather than try to find something with particular qualities. However, after using this soap, I may have to rethink that habit. This soap really does seem to leave skin feeling both clean (with no film left after rinsing) and quite soft. The claims on the back about containing 1/4 moisturizing cream appear to be quite true. Compared to the sometimes tight, post shower feel that I get with my usual choice of soap (generally the plain Kirkland brand at Costco), this is clearly a superior bar of soap.

The only drawback to this soap is the scent, which is the usual strong smell for men's hair and body products. If it were a little less intense, it'd be okay, but it is so strong that the paper box the soap comes in reeks of it. If you're okay with the strong smell and you want something which leaves you very clean but still with soft skin, this is a pretty good choice which is several cuts above the cheap stuff.",4
"I am reviewing the Bath Salts.

Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender bath salts come in a plastic 19 ounce container with a screw lid.  There is no protective seal on the product bottle.

Lavender salts are fragrant salts that you pour into your bathwater when the bathtub is filling with water.  They relax you, and help to ease tensions with their floral fragrances.

These bath salts are quite potent.  A little bit goes a long way, as the scent is pungent.

Pamper yourself after a long day by adding these to your bath.  Relax and inhale the beautiful fragrance of lavender.

These also work well when incorporated into sachets.

The only reason I subtracted a star is because I had to give my tub an extra rinse after taking my Lavender incensed bath with these salts.",4
"My daughter, a verified kid, won't use adult toothpaste.  She almost refused to use Colgate Kids toothpaste because it looks so much like adult toothpaste.  Hint to the makers: Your design team really needs to step up to the plate.  Throw some color on that tube!

After I convinced her to use the toothpaste, she was quite happy.  Bubblegum (ahem, bubble fruit) isn't her favorite flavor, but she says it tastes just like the other sparkly toothpastes, and she likes the pump action because it's less mess than traditional tubes.  Yes, the pump and the rocket stand are definite pluses.  No more toothpaste all over the sink.  She still uses the toothpaste without complaint, so it's a thumbs up from her.",4
"Colgate is my favorite brand of toothpaste.  I and my family always use Optic White.  This review is for Maximum Cavity Protection for growing adult teeth, which is a new concept.  The toothpaste comes in a stand up container that has a press style pump.  You press the pump to express toothpaste, which is a sparkly green colored gel.

The flavor is mild bubble fruit and that is exactly the way the toothpaste tastes, with just a hint of mint added.  The toothpaste offers maximum cavity protection with anticavity  0.24% fluoride.  It promises to fortify weak spots on enamel and helps to reduce plaque buildup with regular brushing.  It also freshens breathe.  It does not have whitening properties, which is the only reason I deducted a star.  My college age daughter brushes with  whitening toothpaste,  so she will brush with this toothpaste first, for cavity protection, to reduce plaque buildup, and to fortify weak spots on enamel, then finish with a whitening toothpaste (like Colgate Optic White) or mouthwash, for whitening benefits.

The toothpaste tastes good and offers some serious benefits for growing adult teeth.  Perfect for my 19 year old daughter!",4
"My kids love using the Colgate pumps. I think it just seems fun to them and they are easier for kids to operate than having to squeeze tubes. I do feel like the pumps leave a little bit left in the bottom though so you get a little bit less product with them. The pumps are definitely less messy though.

Our order came as 6 pumps of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection in mild bubble fruit flavor. The toothpaste is a blue gel. Its slightly fruity but still minty. All 6 pumps had an expiration date of 10/2017 (this is 8/2016) so the expiration date is over a year out - plenty of time to use all 6 pumps. All the pumps have a safety seal on the pump that has to be broken off so you know they are sealed and safe.

The kids really like this flavor and the pump.",4
"I love essie nail polish, I have a nice size collection of it. I also love gel nail polish - I have my own tools (LED light). Nail polish never lasts more than 24 hours on my fingernail no matter what I do. I was excited to try the 2 step polish that requires no cure.

I did two test runs:

Did no nail prep. Just followed directions, two coats of color, one coat of top.

Dries quickly, leaves great gloss

Day 1: Looks great
Day 2: very small chipping to start on dominate hand.
Day 3: chipping on 85% of nails

I remove all polish and prep my nails this time just as I would with doing real gel nails. (Push back cuitical, buf nail to remove shine, cleans, add dehydrator, two coats color, one coat of top.

Day 1-2: Looks great
Day 3: chipping starting on dominate hand
Day 4: removed

Because I can get a much longer wear than my regular polish I say this is a win. A girl (or guy) that tylically gets a fairly long wear with regular polish may get a 5-7 day wear but 14 days may be a streach!

Beautiful color!!!",4
"I have loved the essie line of nail polish for years just for their sheer, wearable colors which go well-beyond their cult classic, ballet slippers. I was curious to see if this gel polish could be as a good as the gel manicures available in salons. My conclusion: It's very close. The pros: This polish goes on smoothly and dries so quickly. The special oval-like brush gives excellent results. The gel top coat has a strong smell, but it does leave my nails looking like they have just been polished. Usually two days in there is a slight dullness and even some chipping, but I have seen none of that. I got this as a freebie, but I would gladly buy this. It's a great way to get a salon-like manicure in 15 minutes of actual polishing time. (And I didn't use anything to speed up the process.)",4
"This is a complete set to get you started with the Electric toothbrush (for two to share)....four brush attachments, toothpaste, mouthwash, and floss.  But the star of the kit, the best thing about it for sure, is the enclosed clock and brushing ""meter"".  What it does is keeps track of how long you brush, giving you four stars for 30 seconds on each mouth quadrant.  You can also get a fifth star (for tongue) if you go a total of 2 1/2 minutes.  For me, that's not a big deal.  But for my six year old, the stars have been a boon to getting him to brush more thoroughly.

He brushes with enthusiasm now, and I've noticed his teeth looking much cleaner than with just a brush alone.  For me, it's a helpful reminder to brush longer than I was used to.  The whole set is convenient, with a countertop charger and no batteries being required.  And having a clock in the bathroom was new to me, and very convenient.

However, two things keep me from giving it five stars.  One, the price point.  I wouldn't pay more than $50 for this set.  In all actuality, it doesn't seem worth the extremely high price point.  I mean, a Crest tote bag?  What am I going to do with that?  I don't think the set warrants the price.

The other minor point about this is you have to brush with your mouth tightly closed or you get watery toothpaste sprayed all over the mirror and counter.  Not to mention your face!  My son has to brush before he dresses or his school shirts get ruined.  So, it's a minor thing to get used to, but sort of annoying.

In all, a great set that would be better if it were more affordable.",4
A spare thermofuse.  Two years ago my dryer spun but there was no heat.  I got a service tech undid the back and changed it in seconds.  So I decided for the price I ordered a spare just in case.,4
"I like this unit but am deducting one star because of the limited viewing angles. When you view from the sides or from the top or bottom, the display becomes much more difficult to read. It's not nearly as clear as the product photos. The display is also rather glossy to you wouldn't want it reflecting something bright, like a window.",4
Works great. Best price I could find on the internest. Shipped quickly with no problems. Will buy this again in 8 months when I need another one.,4
I only use the namebrand filters. I believe that you get what you pay for and I have used these filters for years. They suit my needs.,4
"I used this today, going in from the roof.

Pros:
* Works great to clean out lint - almost ""fun"" to use and see the lint come out
* Comes with a short & helpful DVD (English & French)
* I almost gave it 5 stars but because of the cons I think 4 stars is more appropriate

Cons:
* *** BE CAREFUL *** Have to be careful not to purposely or *accidentally* put the drill into reverse or the brush head will detach/unscrew
* *** BE CAREFUL *** Set your drill clutch to no more than half of the maximum setting or the rods may break from too much torque
* I wonder about the possibility of a rod breaking or brush unscrewing... I wonder how tough this thing is... it seems decent, but I would be more confident if it seemed very well built instead of just ""decent"".

Other:
* See the photos I uploaded. I was surprised how much lint came out.
* My 3-year-old enjoyed watching the DVD over and over!
* I went in from the exhaust on the roof and had the dryer blowing cool air out",4
Getting these burner covers at stores used to be easy. I am glad I found Amazon for my future needs. They are value priced and come from a good dealer.,4
"This did the trick to make my dryer new again. It is a bit different than the original. You have to splice 2 wires together, so be prepared with wire cutters and something to crimp it. The replacement needs screws to secure to the element and in my bag there wasn't any, so I had to make a quick trip to the hardware store to buy them. (all of `10 cents,but added an extra hour to my repair time). All in all my clothes are actually drying at the right time now and I don't have to run it a second time. It came new in plastic bag.",4
"Great product but they need to include more rods in the kit. I had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasn't enough so Ill end up spending $60+ dollars on this kit which isn't terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town, but still, its plastic rods with a brush attached....thats overpriced for something so simple.

So enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review. It works GREAT if you aren't an idiot and use common sense when using it.

1.  Always CLOCKWISE..... again always CLOCKWISE, I cant be anymore clear about this.
2.  Use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number 1 above. Its a good safety measure so just do it, it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape.
3.  Feed one rod at a time, taping each one as you go.
4.  Dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached. If you get resistance, remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggle/shift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue. Most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things. (1) You have a large bend in your duct or (2) you have a lot of blockage. If its number 2, start pulling the rod out (with or without the drill attached (if the drill remains attached, remember to always spin  CLOCKWISE) as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area. Pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again (I didn't disconnect rods during this step but I did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure I didn't damage the rods).
5.  Once youve reached the end of your vent, start pulling your rods out the same way you went in (CLOCKWISE) so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning.  I pushed the brush through 2-3 times in total from different sides of the vent since I was short a few rods and used the leaf blower 4-6 times in between to ensure I was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house (never blow the leaf blower into the house, only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a HUGE mess in your house.
6.  Lastly, Id recommend using a face mask/respirator mask as this stuff is messy and you don't know whats growing in it. I had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time I clean it as its not fun to breath in.",4
"It is so handy to have this many reading glasses at such a reasonable price.  I like this style reading glasses instead of the ones with nose pieces, I find this style more comfortable.  These glasses are very nice...cheaper than Walmart!",4
"great price for the product, though the sizes tend to be bigger (based on mens size i think).  there wasn't a size chart to refer to when i was ordering, so i ended up buying two, each at a difference size.",4
"The shoes fit well in the arch area. They are a little wider in the toe area of the shoe, you feel like you have a lot of room. This does not make the shoe uncomfortable, just had to get used to it. Love the shoe.",4
It looks a bit nicer on the picture. Its very light in such a way that when I held the box I wondered if there was just paper filling inside. They are comfortable for the most. Good looking training shoes overall.,4
"Very good overall.
Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.
Now these shoes are ideal for a basic workout or cross training, I would not get them to do 25,000 steps in Walt Disney World.
Solid choice, overall.",4
I have had this style before in a different color and have received many compliments on the shoes.  They are great walking shoes!  I wear orthotics and these shoes are one of the best I have found to accommodate them for fit.,4
"It's been a long time since I've worked a cross training shoe. This shoe is very light and minimally passed compared to running shoes. That's not meant to be a knock, just a fact.

I ordered the shoes half a size up because as a former runner, I'm used to my feet needing room to spread and swell. I wish I hadn't because they feel a little roomy. I have orthotics, so I think I can remedy the issue once I swap those in.

Otherwise, very good shoes",4
"I was wearing running shoes for cardio dance classes at the gym because I thought they would be sufficient. After getting 2 blood blisters I did some research and found out cross trainers would be more appropriate which is how I ended up buying this pair. They are slightly longer in look then I  would like but I think that is typical of cross trainers. Also, the lacing is done in a way that allows you to tie too tightly if you're not careful (my toes were tingling during one particular work out when I had done this). Other then that I am very happy with the shoes.",4
"Nikes usually run small and I'm a 7.5, so I ordered these in an 8 and they were actually very roomy.  I love them but they are definitely bright orange/coral and not bright crimson like the description said.  I thought they'd be more red in hue to wear with my Ohio State clothes, but instead I use them for running.",4
"Arrived on time. I probably should have gone with a 7.5 instead of an 8 because they do seem a little big, but if I wear thick socks they are fine. Also, they can sometimes make a very annoying squeaky noise when I run on certain surfaces so I'm trying to get them worn in. Over-all, I am satisfied with my purchase!",4
I was really excited when I opened the box to see the color is exactly like the image shows! I have the Nike flex tr 5 and used the same size to order these. They are a little bigger than expected but still comfortable.,4
"i bought a pair from DSW for 50$ and they are very comfortable but i bought a size 6.5 when I normally where a size 7.  and even the 6.5 feels a little roomy.  I have wide flat feet btw.  im not sure if I will keep them even though i love their look and comfort.  I've been having feet problems while taking a gym class and I think they won't give me enough support when running.  they're great for wearing at home or gym and doing exercises in one place- extremely light weight and flexible, but i don't know if they'll last long if you use them everywhere else.  :(  i really like them but i cant just buy 2 different shoes.
also, i really like the strings inside the lining on the side of the shoes to adjust and make the shoe fit snug. it makes me feel secure :D",4
"I've worn these to work out for 5 days in a row now. Initially, my arches ached but over time the discomfort subsided entirely. I've done everything from bootcamps, resistance training, running and Zumba. So yeah.., they are truly crosstrainers ;-)",4
"The picture makes the shoe look like it has a ""boxier"" toe rather than the ""pointier"" toe that it actually has. I have wider feet and generally need to buy a size or half size longer to get a comfortable width (in any brand of shoe). I was shooting for a rounder, broader toe design which is more comfortable for me, and I feel that the pictures of this shoe didn't accurately depict what I received, in that one detail. Otherwise, ""the shoe fits."" So I am wearing it.",4
"I am a recess aide and on my feet all day long. I tried these shoes on in the store before purchasing them on Amazon. They are very lightweight and comfortable. I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.

**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them. They are comfortable, and I love them even more now.",4
"I used the text option to send these last minute gift cards to my Granddaughters (via their mom's phone). Works really well, you get a confirmation email that it has been received, and a confirmation that the cards have been redeemed. Granddaughter's very happy with the card design. I love the options you have when you send Amazon gift cards!",4
"!Always good to give an Amazon Gift Card! I wish they would stop putting the ""A"" symbol on the cards they send with the gift card, really sort of botches the message.",4
"Another gift card for an upcoming bd!!! :) I know, it's a super easy purchase. I just wanted to make sure recipient was able to have alittle drink of whatever he wanted at Starbucks. I don't really buy alot at Starbucks,  but I know people who do. It's just a convient, gift because their located in so many cities, and people seem to really like Starbucks. Happy w purchase would repurchase again! :)",4
"Got this for a seven year old on her birthday, and she's been so excited about her bear it's crazy.  Every day she asks if she can go build her bear, but it's just been too cold.

"UPDATE: 5/31/16

After all the ""hulabaloo"" about an empty Noodles & Co. gift card, I found out from Noodles corporate office customer setvice that you CANNOT enter all the numbers on the back of the gift card to check the balance...only the last 14 numbers from the card. As it turns out, my gift card was fully loaded and ready to use.  Apparently Noodles had several complaints about the issue over the last few months because they added a special note to their gift card page...""If your gift card number has 19 digits, please only enter the last 14 digits of your card number, omitting the first 5 digits."".

**If you recently gifted a Noodles & Co. gift card, please have your giftee recheck their card balance (only enter the last 14 digits of their card number, omitting the first 5 digits) or contact Noodles directly like I did.  You won't regret either transaction.  It would be nice if AMAZON or the gift card seller would add this info to the product description to save time & money for everyone.

The web page is:  [...]

RUNNING LOW? Check your gift card balance anytime! Enter your gift card ID number found on the back of your card in the box below and click on the ""Submit"" button. If it's time to fill up, you can refuel at your neighborhood Noodles & Company.

If your gift card number has 19 digits, please only enter the last 14 digits of your card number, omitting the first 5 digits.

TIP:  Do join the eClub rewards.  You can get free food and get coupons by email.  It's worth the extra little bit of time plus you will learn about new offerings and menu changes.  I especially love the BOGO coupons.  I like to buy a salad and get a second one for the next day or share with a friend.  Gift the card another look.

NOTE: I was not compensated for my review.

===============================
Feb 2016
When I first purchased my gift card  I went online to the Noodles website and checked the balance on my NEW gift card several times and each time it said NO BALANCE.  I was very frustrated and angry.  AMAZON was kind enough the replace the card with a new one.",4
"Subway makes a goof sandwich for sure. The prices are great and the food is always fresh. The bread options are nice, I like the italian herb personally. Definitely a healthy option when your on the go and want something good for you.",4
"The food there is better than average, but I still like Texas Roadhouse which is cheaper than Outback on many steak menus. The gift card purchase on Amazon is a great saving.",4
I was never a fan of outback but I recently ate here after using my gift card and the food was really good. There's nothing like the bloomin onion its so damn good. The cheeseburgers are great and a decent size. Overall Outback is definitely one of the better chain restaurants out there.,4
"Domnio's is always good for a basic pizza, everyone will eat it and the prices are very reasonable. This pizza won't blow you away but it's definitely not bad either. Overall this gift card would make a great gift for anyone since their are  a ton of locations everywhere and it is very affordable.",4
I like the fact that they come in a multi pack. I will split them up for gifts and keep 1 for myself. It will give me the incentive to stop at the nearby Cold Stone since I always forget and I crave it often.,4
It's a good place for snack before a movie start but there's no much meal to eat for dinner. I love their bread and cookies but they should offer more real meals.,4
"This was a good gift for college student, father of college student, my daughter who loves getting gift cards.  Next year, I will make these for $25.00 as they did not turn out to be as popular as I anticipated.",4
"Originally, my first review was a 1 star disaster.  I had to reschedule a ticket purchase and AMC sent the email to refund the money but the gift card kept showing $0 balance.  Finally got that problem resolved.
A few weeks went by and I receive an email from AMC.  It says that not only was the amount spent on my credit card was refunded (had to use my credit card due to no balance) but the entire balance was returned to my AMC card.  That is what a business should do when the customer is right and they are wrong.  AMC regained my business and I have since returned to AMC to see a movie.  Thank you AMC!",4
This was very convenient and easy to use. It appeared quickly in my email and I could use it that same day. The only thing I did not like was that I could not use it for a future order. That is why I went down a star. I missed that convenience.,4
"I like whole foods meat and bakery sections but everything else is wicked over priced and strange. I like my normal regular brands I've always known so all these ""fancy"" grocery items do nothing for me.",4
"Great for us and relatives on our Christmas list.  We used the $15 one right away on soup, salad, and breadsticks.  That is about all we like from Olive Garden.",4
"Olive Garden is good, not your authentic Italian food but it does the trick for a chain restaurant. Some prices are a little high but the fact you get salad and bread sticks with your dinner (for takeout too) makes it worth it. I recommend the chicken Marsala,  it's my favorite item on the menu....sooo good!!",4
"The ""convenience fee"" is annoying if you're not buying tickets for a movie you actually expect to be sold out, like on a premier night or something. I'm glad I bought Beauty and the Beast tickets in advance, though, because it was sold out when I got to the theater. Fandango is just nice and easy to use.",4
"We love these Amazon Gift card boxes. we send each of the Grandkids a $50 card, and their parents help them pick out their goodies on the Amazon site. Really a big hit with the kids!",4
"Very easy to use this gift card. I just wish I would have been able to use it at Drury Inn, but that hotel didn't take online gift cards. There is a large selection of hotels to choose from though. The gift card arrived right on time, with super fast delivery. This gift card made making reservations quick and easy, and took away a lot of the stress involved in traveling. Would definitely buy another gift card in the future when I plan on traveling. Even with making last minute bookings was able to get a nice hotel at a reasonable price. The only thing that would make this gift card better is an email delivery option. Other than that well worthy buy.",4
"Maximum PC is a magazine for electronics freaks, offering many different articles about electronics; how to buy them, how to repair them, how to get the most out of them, and how best to replace them. This magazine is aimed in one primary direction: Making the most out of the electronic devices available. This is accomplished through the many instructional articles, how to guides, and question and answer sessions.

When Maximum PC isn't offering words of wisdom on ways to improve your life with electronics, the magazine is usually offering reviews of new products. The reviews section is one of the largest parts of each issue and while it does a nice job bringing new products to the forefront, the reviews are often less than stellar. Rather than analyze a few products in- depth, Maximum PC instead prefers to offer shorter reviews of many products. This part of the magazine seems more concerned with quantity than quality, in contrast to most of the remainder of the magazine.

One thing about Maximum PC that isn't to my liking is the technical nature of many articles. Maximum PC likes to get to the root of things (literally), and it is common to find articles talking about circuits, memory, and other boring subjects. This is fine for those who take their technology to the extremes, but I have no interest in learning about the inter-workings of the wiring inside my personal computer or the electronic pulses that cause my printer to respond on queue. This is a little too much technology for me, but I know there are some readers who will relish the depths that Maximum PC goes to when it strips down electronic devices into their component parts.

Overall, Maximum PC is a pretty good electronics magazine for young and middle- aged adults. It loses me from time to time when it gets overly technical, but it still ranks as a good magazine about electronics. The numerous question and answer sessions, the educational articles, and the product reviews make this a magazine worth reading.",4
"This magazine has a lower cover price than some of its competitors, and makes up for it with a massive amount of ads. A few ads contain coupons, for those that like to cut those little things out (unfortunately they are hardly ever for anything I want !). The paper is also a lot thinner than the higher priced home/garden publications, and the photographs do not reproduce that well on it.
On the bright side, there are many nice d&eacute;cor ideas, and simply terrific recipes.
Taking the October 2003 edition as an example, Fall colors and produce are the theme. It has some ideas on how to display gourds, and an article on a community pumpkin patch, from the June planting by 140 neighbors and friends in a 6000 square ft. area, to harvest time.
There are numerous articles on remodeling, ""Foolproof Potted Plants"", on the joys of having hardy succulents in your home, and a lovely piece with lots of photographs on actor Peter Strauss' gorgeous Ojai, California garden.
The best article of all, is ""The Magic of Soup"", and some of these recipes are so good they might end up in your family for generations. They are simple to prepare, with easy to find ingredients, and will make a healthy, hearty meal for those frosty days ahead. Also included with the recipes is the preparation and cooking time, and nutritional statistics.
As someone who writes a lot of notes and cards, I appreciate the final page which is about letter writing, and how this vanishing form of communicating is good for the soul.
All things considered, this magazine gives good value, and is meant for those of us who do not live in a mansion or have hours to devote to a single recipe.",4
"Texas Monthly Magazine is a magazine about a state, its places, and its people. This publication covers Texas culture, travel, music, arts, dining, special events, and more. Each issue takes readers on a journey throughout the state and keeps them up to date on the Lone Star State and her people.

Texas Monthly Magazine has more departments than the typical magazine and many of them are fun to read, offering a quick look inside a lesser- known town, festival, or individual that calls Texas home. A good example is the department titled Street Smarts. This short section offers a glimpse inside one of Texas' thousands of small towns along with a numbered list of special points of interest in the city. The music and books departments are fun, too, because they present some popular and soon- to- be- popular media from Texas residents. Another department I like for its pleasant amusement is one called the Manual. It presents something Texas- related in the areas of fashion and style and then offers some advice on the best usage or display of the item based on Texas culture.

Texas Monthly Magazine offers several long, featured articles and they can usually be found starting in the middle of each issue and continuing all the way to about the three- quarter mark. These longer featured articles can focus on most anything, from travel to art to food, to the people who create the art and prepare the food.  There are usually at least a few current event- type articles related to something important in the news while the other featured articles include stories about people, events, etc., that are generally timeless.

Texas Monthly Magazine is a well- written, well- edited magazine and it a nice reference and reading tool for Texas residents who like to learn more about the state and find new places to visit and things to try. I like having it handy, but if I could change one thing about this magazine, it would be the number of ads in each issue. True, all magazines need advertisements in order to generate reveune, but the number of ads in Texas Monthly Magazine is a tad excessive. Each issue opens up with about eighteen pages of ads before even reaching the table of contents. The next hundred or so pages have ads on every other page and the ads only diminish when you get to one of the featured articles. After that, the ads return for the remainder of the issue, with the final thirty to fifty pages consisting of practically nothing but ads.

Going back to the positive points, another reason to like Texas Monthly is the long length of each issue. The magazine is much longer than most, with some issues approaching 300 pages in length. Yes, the ads are excessive, but even if all the ads were removed, you would still have a very large amount of reading material in each issue- much more than found in the majority of magazines.

Texas is a very large, very diverse state with many things to offer and Texas Monthly is a very enjoyable read that helps Texas residents keep up with some of the many happenings in this great state. The ads are excessive, but when all factors are taken into account, this is still an enjoyable publication that every Texan should read and that many outsiders will enjoy as well.",4
"Bottom-line: Popular Science is my new personal science and technology advisor designed to enrich my knowledge of science and technology spanning the globe.

I have always delved into the minutia of how things work.  This natural curiosity grew from, where I don't know where it comes from exactly.  Perhaps it part of the male brain, or perhaps just part of mine; I like to take things apart and see how they work.  It's not enough to know that if I pay my electric bill on time, when I flick on a light switch I will have light; I want to know how the electricity is generated and how it got to the switch.  That same curiosity led me to my current profession as an Information Technology professional.  What started out as a hobby, a need to know how computers worked, has turned into a second career for me.

All of this explains why I subscribe to and read Popular Science Magazine [...], whose slogan is The Future Is Now.  As magazines go, Popular Science is a pretty thin rag, but that does not mean the monthly is not packed with all manner of useful and informative information.  it does mean that the magazine is not (over) burdened with page after page of annoying advertising.  There is of course advertising, a magazine could not survive without it, but is it not overly intrusive and overbearing.

Regular sections in the magazine include:

o Features: feature length articles;
o Megapixels
o What's New
o Headlines
o How 2.0
o FYI
o Other Stuff: includes Letters, and editor's note.

My favorite section is What's New; I tend to read it first every month.  Each section is filled with six or seven pages of text and illustrations one the latest and greatest new products and prototypes from across the world in the science, general technology and astronomy fields. The latest issue featured a big bold article on the future of police equipment, called Cop Tech; Inside The Police R&R Lab. A flashy title to be sure, but is backed up with quality writing as well as pictures and or images of the equipment and gadgets discussed in the article.

Other articles in this month's (February 2007) magazine include:

o Protect Everything; the future of personal security.
o Journey From The Center of The Earth; Popsci Innovator
o It Came From The Lab; Uncommon Knowledge
o Fly The Friendly Seas; Concepts & Prototypes

The articles for the most part are well written, concise, and comprehensive.  Aside from the feature articles, the most informative portion of the magazine are the one or two page explanation features wherein some present or future gadget is explained, usually accompanied by an illustration.  For example on page 27 of this month's issue under the Headlines section the magazine explains in great detail--complete with illustration--how the Department of Energy is building a greener coal plant, that will extract Hydrogen--called Syngas--from water and use it to produce electricity.  The coal is used in the process and the Carbon it creates as a by-product is pumped underground into a saline solution.  The item was short, but came away from it with a thorough understanding of a process I had heretofore never heard of.

I have only one minor quibble with the magazine: almost one third of the back half of the monthly is given over to adverting.  Not the expensive glossy, glamorous kind, but the shady little, not so sure you can thrust what their advertising kind found is too many other wise respectable magazines.

Subscriptions

Popular Science Magazine is published by Time 4 Media. In addition to the English language edition, Popular Science is also published in China, Israel, Korea and Mexico. Book shelf sells for a cover price of $3.99 US, Canada $4.99, while a 12-month subscription will set you back $15.95 and a 24-month subscription checks in at 21.95. If you are doing the math--and you should--that's a 77% saving off the single copy price. You might be able to find a better deal at one of the on-line magazine subscription sites like Magazines.com, or e-Subscription.com.

Conclusion

Other than that one decidedly minor quibble, I have no qualms recommending Popular Science to anyone who asks.  The magazine is my new personal science and technology advisor designed to enrich my knowledge of science and technology spanning the globe.",4
"Popular Science is a magazine I have been reading on and off for more than twenty years and it ranks as a science magazine for the masses. As most readers will tell you, Popular Science is a beginner's science publication and is generally intended for those who are curious about science and want to gain a better understanding of science and technology.

Popular Science is more about technology than science and this is evident from the departments and most of the featured articles. Yes, Popular Science does include articles about atoms, chemicals, outer space, physics, etc., but the majority of the articles are about modern technology and its uses and applications. The technology articles are dedicated to subjects such as new vehicles, environmental trends, electronic devices, and more. Articles like these might seem a little out of scope, but one has to remember that the first word in the title of the magazine is Popular. Technology is huge, so it makes sense that the magazine would dedicate such a large percentage of its articles to high tech.

The writing in Popular Science is very good, but as I said before, this magazine is intended more as a beginner's guide to science and technology. This means the articles will be perfectly fine for those with limited science and technology knowledge.  For those with a more advanced scientific mind, some of the articles may be too elementary. However, every issue can be counted on for at least a couple of in-depth, intellectual articles. Also, one needs to keep in mind that the articles are generally short and cover only a page or two. This is nice for those with shorter attention spans and for those who want to soak up as many facts about as many different things as possible.

Learning more about science and technology is certainly a good idea and Popular Science is a good choice of reading material for those who are scientifically curious, want to improve their science knowledge level, and want to learn about the latest technology. The magazine could prove to be a little too simplistic for those with a working or educational background in science, but for everyone else, Popular Science presents a good means to keep up with the latest in science and high tech with writing that is clear and intelligent without going over the top.",4
"The New Yorker was started by Harold Ross as a humor magazine, and grew into one of the world's most celebrated literary magazines. It never really made money or had a huge circulation, but survived thanks to the generosity of a number of private owners and publishers. I began reading the New Yorker thanks to my mother, who subscribed for nearly four decades. Through it I discovered Berton Rouche's fascinating ""Medical Detective"" stories, Calvin Trillin's hilarious stories about food and travel, the brilliant writing of John McPhee, and scores of other contemporary reporters and short story writers.
Then, in the 1980s, Trisha Brown then managed to completely trash the magazine in only a few short years. Circulation took off- for a time, at least- but the reputation of the New Yorker was sacrificed as it was turned into a gossip magazine. The low point, for me, at least, was a fawning article on poor Erich Honnekar's trial in Germany where he was being charged for ordering the shootings of those East Germans who tried to flee to the west. (Brown's husband, it turned out, had been retained by Honnekar's defense team to do PR work).
Old time subscribers defected by the thousands, and the new subscribers, being a fickle lot, let their subscriptions lapse as well once The New Yorker was no longer a hip fashion accessory to be seen on your coffeetable alongside the latest issue of Interview.
In recent years the magazine has regained some- but not all- or its former glory. The political analysis is still of the fawning variety (neither the Clintons nor the Kennedys can do any wrong) and the fiction has become even more parochial, but a lot of the good reporting has returned. I don't subscribe, but I do peruse issues on the newstand regularly in case I might come across a particularly intersting story. I suggest you might do the same.",4
"Kiplinger's Personal Finance is a worthy challenge to Money Magazine for a monthly dose of economic and investing trends, helpful financial tips, and - in KPF's case - a kind of populist advocacy for the little guy investor.

I came to KPF by way of the well-read hand-me-downs of one of Kiplinger Letters (for which, see elsewhere on [...]) that were pressed into my hands by my mother-in-law 25 years ago.  She probably thought that without I'd lead her daughter into the financial wilderness, where we would thirst and die in good romantic fashion.

I eventually migrated up the Kiplinger food chain to the glossier KPF and have never left.

Much of the information provided by KPF (mutual fund and ETF results and the like) are widely available. The same could be said of the investing advice (look for no-loads with low fees, diversify, don't bail under pressure).

Where KPF excels is in the short articles and tips, which have often prodded me to take money- and/or sanity-saving moves. Two fine recent examples: the articles in the September 2006 issue entitled 'Buy a 2006 car on sale?' and '5 things to ask about silk ties'.  Both of these articles provided solid input into two buying decisions I'm likely to make in the new year. What's more, the conclusions reached by these two authors are probably *not* the ones you'd anticipate.

In terms of macro-economic instincts, the Kiplinger Washington Editors run bullish, though not quite so much as Money's more cosmopolitan-posed writers. KPF won't lure you into buying quite as many fancy gentleman's toys either, a fact that is well observed by their authors, who tend to be mutual fund companies rather than designer suit or German auto makers.

Don't get me wrong, I read other financial rags and might not be as enthusiastic about KPF if it were my only source. But KPF's monthly arrival is still always welcomed, as it has been for years. It remains firmly entrenched in my top tier.",4
"Popular Mechanics is a magazine dedicated to mechanics, repair, industry, and technology. This magazine offers timely articles that are often intelligent, thought- provoking, and often fascinating and/or awe- inspiring. They often talk about mechanical achievements, impressive technology, record- setting feats, etc. These articles show what humans are capable of doing and they remain in your memory for some time.

These achievement- type articles are often the best in each issue, however, Popular Mechanics is more than just a magazine about incredible achievements. With Popular Mechanics, you get articles about cars, home improvement, repair, etc., which are more practical than anything. Car enthusiasts often enjoy Popular Mechanics more than anyone, due to the magazine's consistent articles on automobiles and reviews of automobiles. There are, in fact, multiple articles on automobiles and/or automotive technology in each issue and they are often among the lengthiest in the magazine.

Besides cars, Popular Mechanics likes to devote space to the subject of home repair and improvement. These articles are nice because they offer practical advice that can help do- it- yourself readers save a good deal of cash. They are often educational in nature, too. How Your House Works, for example, is a subsection of the Home department and it describes in detail how a certain part of your home functions. It might sound boring at first, but it is often fascinating to learn what goes on behind the walls, under the foundation, inside the appliances, etc. Sometimes, the educational lesson is obvious but other times, the lessons learned are eye- opening and will expose homeowners to things about their home they never knew existed.

Popular Mechanics is, overall, a very nice publication that I will continue to read. I like the articles that emphasize fascinating innovation and achievement best, but I can also agree that the home and automotive articles are very practical and useful. The over- emphasis on automobiles is a small complaint about Popular Mechanics, but the magazine as a whole is very good and very readable.",4
"Health Magazine is a publication that gears its articles toward a wide array of health- related issues and concerns. When I came across a copy for the first time, I picked it up to read with a degree of skepticism. I thought it would be a magazine exclusively about nutrition, but that turned out not to be the case. This magazine does spend some time talking about healthy eating habits, but this is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this magazine. The editors of this publication talk about all sorts of health topics, like mental health, relationships, parenting, physical fitness, etc. Because of this, Health has something that will appeal to almost anyone who reads it.

This magazine is divided into five main areas: Beauty, Body, Fitness, Mind, and Food. My personal favorites are the Mind and Food sections. I like the Mind area the best because it's the one where I usually find articles that are most relevant to my own health concerns. Here, you can learn about useful things like how to reduce stress in your work and in life, how to deal with problem children, and other informative topics. To a lesser extent, I also like the Food section because it includes some very interesting recipes that show how you can spice up ordinary, routine meals for little cost and minimal effort.

If there is one thing to criticize about this publication, it would have to be the fact that it is primarily geared toward women. The Beauty section, for example, is focused almost entirely on feminine concerns, with advice on makeup, eliminating wrinkles, etc. Some of these articles could, of course, be applied toward men but they are mostly centered on woman and the models used in the photos throughout most of the sections of the magazine are female. On the flip side, however, my criticism will prove to be an asset for women, many of whom will find this magazine very useful.

Still, in spite of this small criticism, Health is still a very good magazine for all to read. Remember- this is not just a nutrition magazine. The importance of vitamins, minerals, fats, proteins, and carbs comprises only a small part of the publication. The remaining sections of the magazine feature some very useful articles on mental health, relationships, disease control and prevention, healthy cooking, etc., making Health a good publication with articles and columns that anyone can relate to.",4
"Runner's world is a very traditional magazine with geared towards mostly a middle-aged audience.  The authors manage to give the same advice every month and make it sound different.  That may be one of the things that makes this magazine so motivational.  I keep reading about people who have run every day for the last fifty years or who run in 30 below weather, and I wonder what's keeping me off the roads.
The Rave Run two page spread photographs are lovely.  They each show a runner in a really cool environment with a quote.  I have some of them hanging on my wall.  I get especially motivated by the one of a man running through the woods when the trees are coated with ice and the ground blanketed with snow.  It looks so beautiful, who wouldn't want to go out and run.  The ask the expert or Q&A section has the most diverse and informative information from month to month mostly because the questions come from readers and the answers come for a variety of experts.  The nutrition section isn't particularly useful.  The science seems simplified to the point that it isn't exactly true, and the suggested menu for one of the carbohydrate dinners starts out with 1 cup broiled swordfish along with five or six other things; not really practical in my opinion.
Runner's World has a nice coverage of racing events past (results) and future (racing calendars), and my hometown of Boulder, CO is mentioned somewhere at least once per issue :).  Runner's World encourages everyone to be a winner even if he or she doesn't finish first.  It is full of tips for beginners just staring to run and more advance information about training for seasoned amateurs.  Some of the information is useful and some is not, but there is enough useful information to make reading worthwhile.",4
"Parents magazine is a very good publication about raising kids to be happy, healthy adults. It offers some good advice about the task of parenthood, illustrating the hard work and rewards that go hand in hand if parents perform their role in the best possible manner.

I like this magazine as a whole, but there are a few things that potential readers need to know about before they pick up a copy to read. First of all, the articles in Parents magazine deal mostly with younger children, below twelve years of age. You won't find much of value in this magazine if you have teenagers. It is intended more for families with youngsters.

Another thing about this magazine that makes it less practical than it otherwise would be is the suggestions for family activities. The ideas presented here are all pretty good, but the problem is that the majority of them involve outlays of cash and/or time that are unrealistic for most families. I can agree, for example, that adding a game room would make a nice addition to one's house and would add tremendously to a family's time spent together. But how many among us can afford a home addition? Parents magazine talks about activities and enhancements like this in an unrealistic way, making them seem much simpler and easier to implement than they really are.

Aside from distractions like that, however, Parents is a very good magazine to read. It's one of the longest magazines you can buy, with 200 to 300 pages per issue. Add to that the low subscription price, a few pages of coupons, and the generally sound parental advice and you have all the makings of a good magazine for young families.",4
"This is primarily my wife's subscription, so this is mostly her input - she has me read a couple features each month.  There are so many things she finds useful about the magazine - I can tell you she spends several hours reading each issue and regularly cuts out articles to save in our ""parenting"" file or to put on the fridge.  Here are just a few of the great regular features of each monthly issue:
- ""As They Grow"", pointers and insights related to a particular subject, one each for eight different age groups (from pregnancy to pre-teen years)
- ""can you help?"", suggestions from readers about how to handle a common problem, such as the dentist or cutting your child's nails
- Suggestions to keep your child busy in the house
- An Emergency Guide pull-out for dealing with various situations like electrical shock, bee stings, etc.
- Product recalls, usually with pictures
- Product testing and reviews (similar to Consumer Reports)
Why not 5 stars?  There are a couple annoying features in the magazine, such as ""out of the mouths of babes"" and some of the suggestions for children's activities around the house sound easier to do than they really are (sort of like what people say about Martha Stewart).  It can also be a bit of a downer to read the stories about serious illnesses some children have had and how their families cope - not always what you're in the mood for when you're thinking about your own healthy child.  But overall, this magazine is the best one out there for parents AND they are branching out - we recently started receiving Baby Parents.  It's tough to know everything about raising your child so outside sources of information are key.  Parents magazine is a great resource that has been well worth the small subscription price.",4
"Sunset is a magazine dedicated to the people, culture, and lifestyle of the American west. This magazine divides its space among many different topics, such as food and entertainment, travel, recreation, gardening and more.

I have been reading this magazine for about six months now and there are several things about it that make it worthwhile. The thing that stands out the most are the photographs, and I'm not talking about just the stunning scenery one normally associates with the West (like the National Parks or the coastline). Even the ordinary pictures are striking. In the Gardening section, for example, it is common to find pictures of family homes that have beautifully landscaped yards full of blossoming flowers and colorful plants. In the Home & Design section, one can find nice photographs of home interiors, showing different designs and furniture.

One of the most unique qualities of Sunset is the fact that it is published in five different editions. There is a specially designed issue for the Northwest (Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska, and British Columbia), Northern California (Northern California and the majority of Nevada), Southern California (Southern California and Hawaii), The Southwest (Arizona, New Mexico, and the Las Vegas area of Nevada), and Rocky Mountain (Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah). This is a nice idea and it's one that other magazines should consider emulating. Based on where you live or where you have an active interest, this will be the region that your issue spends its pages covering. My subscription is for the Northern California region, so I am treated each month to articles about places like San Francisco, Sacramento, Reno (Nevada), Lake Tahoe, etc.

One of the specialties of this magazine is food and it is common to find recipes throughout every issue. There is a special section set aside for food, but one can expect to find food articles and recipes everywhere as they read. Even the cover page of each issue features a food dish. And as you might guess, the featured recipes are generally those types of cuisine normally associated with each specific region of the west, with plenty of generic recipes thrown in to make sure everyone has something to cook.

One of the specialty sections of this magazine that I like is the ""Value Vacation""- a subsection of Travel & Recreation. This section highlights a specific place to travel and then offers a day by day breakdown of things to do and places to see, with the cost for each itemized so you know exactly what to expect. The highlighted city or tourist area can be anyplace in the west and isn't limited to the region that your issue covers. This section is nice because it lets you see in black & white what it will cost for a few days of budget entertainment. It reminds me of some of the television programs shown on the Travel Channel.

Advertisements cover about 40 to 50 percent of the pages of each issue and they are often found in bunches in the front and back and on alternating pages for much of the rest of each issue (typical for most magazines). The ads can center on all sorts of different things. Because this is a combination travel/culture/food/entertainment/home & garden/living magazine, the ads cover a wide range of products and services, from laundry detergent to credit cards to cat food.

Overall, Sunset has proven itself an enjoyable magazine. I don't live in the western United States but this region is my favorite part of the country, so it makes sense that I would find something of value in this publication. I like the photography, the personal stories, the gardening and decorating ideas, and most other aspects of this magazine. If you're dead set in your ways and refuse to read about anything that deviates from your Eastern, Southern, or Midwestern lifestyle, then you may not like Sunset. But for the majority of people, Sunset has much to offer with pages and pages of eye- catching pictures and friendly articles about life in the American West.",4
"Bottom-Line: If you are looking for a magazine written for the not-so-average Joe, ""Men's Journal Magazine"" might be for you.

The world of Men's magazines, or magazines that are marketed towards a certain portion of the male reading populace, is littered with twaddle that only seems to appeal to the baser instincts of the male gender.  You know the magazines; they need not be mentioned here.  Some are happily folding tent never to heard from again.  Truth be told there are very few magazines that appeal to the more intellectual side of a man (yes ladies we do have such a side).

But recently as ""special gift"" for renewing my Bally's Total Fitness membership I received a 1 year subscription to ""Men's Journal Magazine"", ""a general interest, active lifestyle magazine with a focus on adventure, travel, equipment, sports, fitness, health, and style.""

""Men's Journal Magazine"", is published monthly by Wenner Media, the same publishing house that brings us such notable sidewalk fare as Us Weekly and Rolling Stone.  The magazine will set you back $3.95 an issue at the local newsstand, but 1 year subscriptions can be had for $9.95.  Inside each approximately 120-page magazine you will not find half clothed women dripping with sexy come hither stares.  Nor will you find the next Hollywood ""it"" girl, or wannabe skinny model with a fake tan gracing the pages of this Men's magazine.  No, ""Men's Journal"" is serious business folks; vapid men with one track minds and adolescent libido's need not apply!

""Men's Journal"" is a smartly written, thoughtfully designed magazine for the active intellectual male.  The magazine offer feature-length articles on a wide range of subjects based on the magazine's central theme: adventure, travel, equipment, sports, fitness, health, and style.

However, like most magazines in America, ""Men's Journal"" depends heavily on advertising to generate revenue, but unlike fashion magazines that seem to be 90% advertising and 10% substance, ""Men's Journal"" only dedicates every other page to colorful spreads bent on selling us stuff we don't really need, or in some cases don't need but really, really want, but can't afford.  To its credit, most of the advertising is not dedicated to men's fashions, wore by young impeccably sculpted and groomed men, or automobiles that are impossibly expensive, but instead to the business of adventure and sports.

Conclusion

When all is said and done I enjoy reading ""Men's Journal Magazine.""  Granted, given my current lifestyle (my days of adventures have been traded in for the American Dream and all that entails for now), the information the magazine imparts is only marginally useful to me.  The fitness articles are rater short and are mostly how-to's that while useful are just barely so.  Most of the equipment discussed in Men's Journal is for the magazines target audience with the appropriate disposable income; that's not me.

Nonetheless, when my subscription runs out in another ten months I will probably renew.  Why?  Because ""Men's Journal"" represents my kind of man: thoughtful, intelligent, adventurous (hey, I used to ride submarines, hike mountains and scuba dive and I still want to go sky-diving), man who actually appreciates full-length feature articles or two written by grown-ups for grown-ups.

If you are looking for a magazine written for the not-so-average Joe, filled with those little tidbits in life only men can appreciate, but also brings a healthy infusion of intelligent to its well written and information pages, ""Men's Journal Magazine"" might be for you.",4
"My mailbox overflows with magazines and among the themes, home and home- related topics are the most common. Dwell Magazine ranks as one of the better home magazines I read each month and it is one of only a few publications that I will return to throughout the month for entertainment and other purposes.

What makes Dwell a unique publication is its dedication to more interesting and unusual home remodeling and rebuilding ideas. Other modern home magazines exist, but Dwell Magazine takes the idea of modern to a slightly different level than other, similar publications. With Dwell Magazine, the reader is presented with unusual homes, both on the exterior and interior, and many of them are certainly eye- catching, if nothing else. This magazine is all about homes that offer distinction and some of the design ideas are very interesting and will stick with you for a long time.

Probably the most unique fact about Dwell Magazine is that, while it focuses on unusual and creative home design, it manages to maintain a level of livability. Other magazines that focus on unusual things- whether it's the home or something else- often take the weirdness factor to the extreme and they end up alienating most readers. But Dwell Magazine avoids making this mistake. The ideas it presents are unusual and creative, but still within the boundaries of taste and practicality.

Magazines usually offer articles that cover a large range of topics each month, but one other interesting aspect of Dwell Magazine is that each magazine is based on a specific theme. This theme is clearly spelled out on the front cover, directly under the magazine's name, in bold letters. This is nice because you already have a good idea what to expect when you open the pages of any issue. The featured articles for the month will stick to the main theme for that particular issue.

Dwell Magazine is one of hundreds of publications that focus on the home, but it easily stands out in the pack and I rank it among my favorites in this genre. I'm not into home design on a do-it-yourself level, but I do like to look at homes and the rooms within homes and I am always open to new ideas. Dwell Magazine offers plenty of creative ideas every month and it's a good magazine to consult for home makeover plans.",4
"Entrepreneur magazine is one of my favorite business publications and it's the type of magazine I can count on for up- to- date information on business startups and for possible resolutions of common problems to the small business owner. A monthly publication, this magazine is designed to appeal to those who are presently owners of a small enterprise or who aspire to open their own business in the near future.

What I enjoy most about this magazine are its personal articles- stories about ordinary people like you and me who have successfully started a new business venture. These people share their success stories with the reader, offering insight on what strategies helped them reach their present level of success and what challenges they still face. The people featured in the articles are more down to earth types who own smaller companies, making the magazine more realistic and something I and others can better relate to. Many other business magazines spend too much time interviewing billionaire CEO's and others who, while they may have some interesting stories to share, live lifestyles and have problems that only someone of their stature can relate.

On the practical side, Entrepreneur contains many timely articles about common issues/problems/challenges that arise when you own your own company. Money, marketing, management, and other key topics are covered in each issue, with a regular department for these critical aspects of business ownership. In these sections, you can learn about tax law changes, legal issues with benefits, and other related topics.

Entrepreneur organizes each issue quite nicely, with colored tabs on the pages that indicate which section (money, technology, marketing, etc.) they pertain to. This makes it that much easier to sift through, to find the information you need. And there is a section titled ""Sources"" that helps to index the different services and companies mentioned in each issue.

Overall, this is a useful, practical magazine that can come in very handy for present business owners and for those who have an interest in proprietorship. It keeps business owners up to date with the latest changes in laws and it offers some creative solutions to the everyday problems that small businesses encounter each day.",4
"Bottom-Line: A glossy well put together magazine ""Bon Appetit Magazine"" is well worth the subscription that is if you are a serious cook.  And even a not so serious one.

The world of cooking, gourmet and otherwise magazines is festooned with glossy covers adorned with tempting dishes of un-nameable foods we are supposed to enjoy preparing. But ""Bon Appetit Magazine"" has them all whipped with its life-sized scrumptious looking delicacies begging to be devoured.  For instance the June 2008 issue has a picture of a Cheddar Burger with Chipotle Ketchup; the life-sized burger looks absolutely delectable.

""Bon Appetit Magazine"", which bills itself as a food and entertaining magazine, is published monthly by Conde Nast Publications Inc. and is aimed at serious-minded cooks who passionate about the dishes they prepare.  They, like me are interested in what new in the world of cooking; not only that but they, like me have a keen interest in straying from the norm in the dishes they cook.

Unfortunately like most magazines in America, ""Bon Appetit Magazine"" depends heavily on advertising to generate revenue, dedicates every other page to colorful spreads bent on selling us stuff we don't really need, or in some cases don't need but really, really want, but can't afford.  To its credit, most of the advertising is dedicated to cooking and the stuff of cooks.

Bon Appetit Magazine Contents

""Bon Appetit Magazine"" --a monthly publication--is a striking combination of the trivial and useful information and divided up in the following sections:

o Fast, Easy, Fresh
o Family Style:
o At the Market
o Cooking Life
o Health Wise
o Wine & Spirits
o Prep School
o Features

Conclusion

A glossy well put together magazine ""Bon Appetit Magazine"" is well worth the subscription that is if you are a serious cook.  However, even the not-so-serious cook will find something within the folds of the gorgeous magazine.  When all is said and done I enjoy reading ""Bon Appetit Magazine"" not only because of the well put together articles and outstanding recipes, but also because the food look so darned inviting!  How come my dishes never turn out looking like the cover of a magazine?

While I have to admit that some of the recipes are a little out there, the ones I have prepared have turned out well enough.  Be prepared you will have to shop for these ingredients; the average ""Bon Appetit"" recipe does not use your usual American kitchen staples.

For instance in the June 2008 issue a recipe for Hazelnut-crusted chicken with raspberry sauce calls for lightly packed fresh raspberries, safflower oil, chopped hazelnuts, panko (Japanese breadcrumbs), and finely chopped mint leaves; not exactly stuff one might find at the local Jewel.

Did I mention that the photography in ""Bon Appetit Magazine"" is a feast in-and-of-itself?  No doubt there is a healthy dose of staging and a whole lot of Photoshop behind the gloss, but the effect is real enough.  Ready to pick one up yet?",4
"I love hiking and the outdoors. I've always enjoyed reading backpacker and three years ago, I subscribed for three years. Now, my subscripiton is coming to an end. I almost didn't renew, as with other magazines of late, the quality is going downhill and the magazine has lost about 20 pages. It is not what is used to be. There seems to be a trend out there, and I can't be the only one that notices it, but over the last year or so, some of my favorite magazines have cut down on the amount of pages in each issue and it is noticeable. I know the economy is in a sh-t, but I did pay in advance for a cerain magazine. Suddenly, all these magazine shrink the issues without any notice what so over. And they expect to keep us when the price remains the same for less of the magazine. I don't know. For this reason, I didn't want to pay a lot to renew. I figured I'd renew for one more year to give it a chance, and see where the magazine is headed. Happily, the price at Amazon.com beat the renewal/new subscription prices offered by Backpacker magazine itself. Imagine that. Hopefully, Backpacker goes back to where it was, instead of where it seems to be going. If it doesn't, it'll be another magazine I will not renew. You'd think the publishers would want to keep the subscribers they do have, but they don't. I know because I have contacted editors of a few magazines: Smart Computing for one and the editor first asked me what I missed. When I told him, he couldn't care less. What a bad attitude! Needless to say, I cancelled my three subscription and received a refund, only partial because they wanted to keep all my money.",4
"Bottom-line: ""Money Magazine"" is my new personal financial advisor and hopefully its sage advice will help me navigate the pitfalls of personal investing.

Okay, I'll admit it my latest job move left us with a little more disposable income, and a pay raise last month helped immensely.  So we now have more money to invest, but I do not want to pay someone to do it for me, I want to keep my hands on my own stash thank you very much.  But I will admit I need practical advice on where to invest my money, not only for retirement, but for my 11-year-old's college education.

I briefly though about subscribing to Fortune Magazine, but quickly dismissed the magazine: too upscale with little practical advice to the average middle class American.  I have long read the Money Magazine section on CNN.com, and found the information timely and utilitarian in the extreme.  So I decided to subscribe to the print edition.

""Money Magazine,"" which bills itself as the magazine ""For you, your family, your future,"" is a monthly rag published by Time Warner Inc.  The magazine covers a broad swath of personal money matters from investing in education to sound retirement advice; from which stocks and bonds are the best long range pick, to the best places to live in America.

Checking in at 156 pages (this issue), ""Money Magazine"" is refreshingly free of endless pages of wall-to-wall advertising, though every other page does tend to be an advertisement; I guess they have to pay the bills somehow.  But the advertisements contained within do not interfere with information presented in the magazine, nor do they compromise the quality.  From cover to cover, page-to-page ""Money Magazine"" has proven a very useful reference source on all matter concerning personal finance.

Regular sections in the magazine include:

o Features: feature length articles;
o Start: tips and helpful shorts on money management;
o Plan: planning for retirement, and other financial planning articles;
o Home: tips and articles dealing with the home;
o Invest: investment tips and stock, bonds, and mutual funds;
o Spend: smart ways to spend your money.

The latest issue featured the magazines seminal ""America's Best Places to Live"" issue, in which the periodical lists the best place to bring up a family based on certain criterion, including Education, Jobs/Economy, Safety, Ease of Living, Arts/Leisure, and Park Space. I was pleasantly surprised to find two cities I used to live on the list.

Other articles in this months (August 2006) magazine include

o The Last 401(K) Guide You'll Ever Need; five rules that really matter.
o America's Best Places to Live
o Everything You Know About Kids and Money is Wrong; teaching kids about money doesn't work.  Here's what needs to be done.
o Hidden Assets; that dusty folder with the old savings bonds, forgotten gift certificates and yellowed insurance policies may hold some real treasures.
o Can Money Buy Happiness; research sheds light on how you can (and can't) spend your way to a sunnier outlook.
o Quest For The Simple Life; the Edels have raised frugal living to an art.  In our consumer culture, that's anything but simple.

The articles for the most part are well written, concise, and comprehensive.  The most useful part is the detailed advice on stock, bonds, and mutual funds picks.  There is never a hard sell; the information is presented in a well laid out and easy to read format.  For instance in the Invest section of this months magazine, ""Money Magazine"" laid out a listing of (70) blue-chip growth stock one could invest in the long haul.  For each stock the magazine listed the name of the stock, including ticker symbol, Price, 1-Month Return, 12-month Return, P/E Ratio, Earnings Growth, and Yield of the particular stock.  The same format is repeated for bonds and mutual funds throughout the magazine.

But not all is sunshine and glossy pages.  Though I found the recent article on The Best Places to Live in America useful; it was short of a lot of pertinent information.  Cary, NC caught my wife's eye as a possible retirement spot, but the print article was short on detail.  On-line however, a lot more information was to be had including the median family income for the area, as well as median home price, and tax information.  The content on-line was much more involved; this is both a curse and a blessing; a curse for those who lack Internet access and a blessing for those who don't mind gleaming more information on-line.  I have Internet access and I would have preferred to get the information from the magazine' print edition, or both places.

Other than that one decidedly minor quibble, I have no qualms recommending ""Money Magazine"" to anyone who asks.  The magazine is my new personal financial advisor and hopefully its sage advice will help me navigate the pitfalls of personal investing.",4
"Traditional Home is a nice little magazine about home living and the many ways to make a home look great, both inside and out. This magazine takes a slightly different approach to homes when compared to others of its genre. Instead of focusing on size and modern amenities, Traditional Home directs its attention toward classic style and elegance with an up- to- date twist.

Home decorating/improvement are the main subjects in Traditional Home and there are several departments and main features dedicated to adding a touch of classic style to your house. One article might talk about the addition of different comforters and pillows to your bedroom. Another could talk about adding antique clocks to your family room. Still another might focus on sprucing up the outside of your home by planting flowering bushes. These features and departments all have the same goal in mind: To take a plain, drab room or exterior and spice it up with some old- fashioned elegance.

Not all of the pages in Traditional Home are dedicated to the subject of decorating. The magazine does offer a few more subject areas to make it better rounded. It is common, for example, to find an article or two about home entertainment and this is especially true around the holiday season. There are also some articles that are related to travel; e.g., travel to visit a unique antique shop or partake in a home decorating event.

Traditional Home is a classy magazine and there are many things I like about this publication. One nice quality is that the suggestions for decorating are not comprised of items exclusively for the rich and famous, like many other, similar magazines. Yes, there are some more expensive ideas presented here but there are an equal number of less expensive ideas for both decorating and for entertaining. Another quality I like is the personal touch so common in most of the articles. Ordinary people share their personal stories about why they chose to remodel their bathroom the way they did; why they celebrate Christmas the way they do; or why they added a collection of antique art to their family room. These personal touches help make the magazine more then just a buyer's guide- they make it a magazine that is nice to read and relate to.

Overall, Traditional Home is a nice magazine about homes, decorating, and entertaining with plenty of colorful photos that offer great interior visual appeal. It is amazing what can be done to an ordinary room with some dedicated effort, and Traditional Home aims to guide readers in this direction; helping to turn a plain, boring home into a feast for the visual senses.",4
"The Wine Spectator is one of those magazines designed to reassure you that you're rich or that you soon could be, all in the context of a shared love for the fruit of the vine.

There's lots of deadly serious material in this glossy, pleasing publication. But if you're a lover of wine who is *not* rich - the category includes this reviewer - you need to learn to take it with a sense of humor. Just enjoy the game.

That game includes a travelogue of the world's wine regions as well as the possibility of gaining a decent education via month-by-month reading in viticulture and wine appreciation itself. This reader is in it for the long haul - I hope to enjoy good wine at an affordable cost for the duration of this earthly slog - and the Wine Spectator is my companion along the way.

My job takes me out for many dinners in various parts of the world that include wine-splendored places like France, South Africa, Chile, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand and - of course - Northern California.  But with wineries now in 49 of the USA's fifty states, what's *not* a wine region these days?

On those business treks, I find myself out for dinner as often as not. It's personally satisfying to know just enough to order a Pinotage in Capetown, since only South Africa produces this varietal, or to opt for one of Argentina's persuasive Malbecs because they're just *that* good.  We're not talking wine snobbery here, just satisfaction at the margins of life's all too margin-less journeys.

If this sounds like your game, the Wine Spectator may be a worthwhile investment. Even if not, consider splitting a subscription with a colleague. That's what I do. At half the price, I get a fine magazine and avoid burdening my bookshelves with one more heavy, beautiful, pleasant magazine. Life can deal you worse.",4
"Wine Spectator is a good wine magazine that seeks to keep the reader informed about new wine products, wine facts and education, and wine events. This magazine is published 17 times per year, so it is available often enough that most wine lovers will have more than their fill of reading material.

Most of the material in Wine Spectator deals with buying wine, and you can expect to find several rating lists in every issue. The editors of the magazine supply the majority of the wine ratings, so when you read that one wine earned 95 points and another only 80, you need to keep in mind that these ratings are from the perspective of people who have sampled hundreds or even thousands of different wines. And with each rating or analysis, there is often contact information, such as the name of the winery or web page, so that you can learn more and/or inquire on making a purchase.

To help shoppers find the wines in each issue, Wine Spectator includes a detachable card that includes the names of the different featured wines. This is a handy addition, because it eliminates the need to copy down names of wine on paper or attempt to memorize the titles. All you do is check off the wines you like on the card and take it with you to your favorite beverage store for easy reference.

Wine Spectator seems to have an obsession with lists and with outlandish proclamations. It is common to find lists like ""World's 100 Greatest Pinot"" or ""The 50 Finest California Reds"". Consumers are attracted to listings, and that is probably why the magazine gave in and made lists a regular part of most issues. And it is common to find extreme statements like ""This is the best Cabernet Sauvignon on the Planet"" or ""Greatest German White Wine Ever"". The publication does this to attract attention and sell more issues, but it could get annoying to some readers.

In spite of these few annoyances, Wine Spectator is still a good magazine. The writers at Wine Spectator are very good, very convincing, and very persuasive. They really know wine, and it comes through in their articles and recommendations. The editors articulate themselves very well and they know just the right way to describe the different brands and styles. It all adds up to a very informative magazine publication on the world of wine.",4
"Bottom-line: Within its 130 or so glossy pages I have found a home, a resting place from which I can gleam my needed automotive knowledge.

Like most men in their twenties I was a car guy.  I ate and drank the elixir of horsepower, torque, RPM's, and colored sheet metal.  I could recite long lists of carlines and their varying specifications.  I subscribed to and devoured all of the (four) the nation's most popular car magazines of the time: ""Car & Driver,"" Motor Trend, Road & Track, and the beauty queen of them all, Automobile Magazine.  But as time and overseas assignments took my attention elsewhere, one-by-one my subscriptions lapsed and my car fetish all but died.

But, now in the autumn of my life, I have rekindled my love of cars, especially expensive high performance mid-sized cars from well-known and well respected nameplates we all know: Cadillac, BMW, Audi, Lexus, Lincoln, Jaguar, and of course Mercedes-Benz.  So when I got a $5.00 off coupon from Magazines.com via e-mail, I plowed through the 230 or so men's magazines before finally deciding on ""Car & Driver Magazine"" published monthly by Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S., Inc.

Like most car magazines, ""Car & Driver"" is full of glossy, colorful, pictures and serious well written articles, car comparisons, and long-term road tests, but the magazine offers so much more.  Unlike the other automobile periodicals, ""Car & Driver"" serves up truly useful (practical) information for the everyman, or woman.  This subtle distinction elevates ""Car & Driver"" above the rest and makes it far and away the best car rag for my hard earned money.

However, like other three American car magazines ""Car & Driver"" covers a broad swath of the American automobile scene, but it also does a fair job of delving into the international automobile scene as well.  And the reaches far-a-field to bring readers the off-beat, the exotic and the really expensive, but fear not the Chevrolet Aveo's of this world also find a place inside the glossy pages of ""Car & Driver"" magazine.  And the magazine does this is a format that is easy to follow and extremely inviting.

For instance in the October 2008 issue ""Car & Driver"" featured the previews/road tests of the following cars: Acura ZDX, Alfa 8C Spider, 2011 BMW X1, Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG, 2010 Ford Shelby Mustang GT500 Convertible, 2009 Pontiac G8 GXP, plus a comprehensive write-up on The Best Cars for $20,000.  Add to these two very well written and equally as comprehensive comparison article: Audi R8 V-10 vs. Ferrari 430 Scuderia, and you have receipt for the most useful automobile magazine this side of the pond.

Another strong incentive to read ""Car & Driver"" is its decided lack of wall-to-wall advertisements.  Most of the magazine is dedicated to substance; the articles are what make ""Car & Driver"" such a joy to read.  The articles are well written, concise, and comprehensive.  And although the writers fill the paragraphs with lexicon of the automobile industry, the prose never talks down to the reader, or looses my interest along the way.

Another way ""Car & Driver"" distinguishes itself from the rest, is its more than comprehensive write-up on each automobile within the magazine.  Even the shortest articles, or write-up's feature a detailed description of the car, its interior and exterior specifications, road test results, pricing, and possible competitors.  No other magazine that I have read thus far--Automobile, Motor Trend, or Road & Track--offers as much useful information.

Interspersed between these nuggets of auto knowledge are other articles that deal with esoteric but informative tidbits from the automotive arena.  For instance the same issue that brought us the above mentioned articles offered up a 6-page article on a WWII era Jeep!  Not exactly need to know information, but human interest stories are always welcome in this world seemingly filled with nothing by death and mayhem.

Even some of the photographs in ""Car & Driver Magazine"" have a story to tell in the guise of in-depth exterior and mechanical analysis.  In the final analysis there is no other car magazine I would rather subscribe to than ""Car & Driver Magazine.""  Within its 130 or so glossy pages I have found a home, a resting place from which I can gleam my needed automotive knowledge.  For me there is no other Car Mag!",4
"Motorcycle enthusiasts are a unique breed and the main quality that sets them apart from the rest of civilization is their unyielding enthusiasm for their chosen sport/hobby. They often become consumed with biking and, like golf fanatics and others, they view every spare moment as an excuse to partake in their chosen activity.

Cycle World is a magazine designed with the motorcycle enthusiast in mind. This publication is made for the type of biker who not only likes to ride his cycle, but also liked to learn as much about motorcycles as possible. There are, of course, plenty of articles in each issue of Cycle World that talk about the joys of riding and the sport of motorcycle racing. But Cycle World includes other articles, too- articles that only the well- rounded motorcycle fan will be likely to read and appreciate. Some articles focus on new technology. Others dispense advice on motorcycle repair. There are also travel articles and personality profiles as well, making for a nicely rounded publication.

I'm not a motorcycle enthusiast or even a casual fan, but I still like certain sections of Cycle World and I try to read a few of them every month. My favorite sections of Cycle World are those that feature new products. Cycle World is among the first publications to report on new motorcycles and other related products and the magazine includes plenty of great photos, test data, and various statistics. In a matter of minutes, one can quickly learn the pros and cons of a specific motorcycle and more easily make a buying decision. Even though I am not a fan, I still like these articles because, like articles on new cars, they often include some very cool new product offerings that can easily impress anyone- even a nonfan like me.

Motorcycles are loved by their many enthusiastic fans and Cycle World is a magazine intended for those who want a well- rounded publication about motorcycles, their upkeep, and their use for entertainment. Most of the pages in each issue are dedicated to the different motorcycles produced by different manufacturers, but there is plenty other information to be found in this magazine about motorcycles and Cycle World makes a good choice for those who want to know how to ride, repair, and enjoy their hobby as much as possible.",4
"Bottom-line: Within its 130 or so glossy pages I have found a home, a resting place from which I can gleam my needed automotive knowledge.

Like a lot of middle-aged men I am a car guy.  I eat and drink--more or less--the elixir of horsepower, torque, RPM's, painted wheels, ergonomic cockpits, and colored sheet metal.  I can recite long lists of carlines and their varying specifications.  At various times in the last five years I have subscribed to and devoured three of the nation's most popular car magazines: Motor Trend, Automobile, and Car & Driver.  But, I recently gave up my subscription to Automobile and received a $5.00 off coupon from Magazines.com via e-mail; I replaced it with ""Road & Track Magazine,"" published monthly by Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S., Inc.

Like most car magazines, ""Road & Track Magazine"" is full of glossy, colorful, pictures and serious well written articles, car comparisons, and long-term road tests, but the magazine has little to distinguish itself from its brethren.  I used to read ""Road & Track Magazine"" back in my twenties, and while the magazine has moved itself smartly into the 21st century, the basic formula that made the magazine fun and informative back in the 1980's remains virtually unchanged.

""Road & Track Magazine"" does an excellent job of covering the national (American) and International car scene. And the reaches far-a-field to bring readers the off-beat, the exotic and the really expensive, but fear not the Chevrolet Volt's, Suzuki Swift's and Toyota Corolla's of the world also find a place inside the glossy pages of ""Road & Track Magazine.""  And the magazine does this is in a format that is easy to follow and extremely inviting.

For instance in the June 2010 issue ""Road & Track Magazine"" featured the previews/road tests of the following cars: Jaguar XJ, Audi R8 Spyder; Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 vs. Nissan GTR vs. Porsche 911 Turbo; plus a long-term test wrap-up of the Acura TL SH-AWD, as well as a features write-up on the Suzuki Swift, Mazda Demio, and Toyota iQ.  Add to these two very well written and equally as comprehensive competition articles: Electric Boogaloo -Tesla vs. Lotus, and Formula 1, Then & Now, and you have receipt for the most useful automobile magazine in the country.

Because of its name ""Road & Track Magazine"" does seem to cover the racing circuit more than it fellows, which would be fine if I followed Formula 1, NASCAR, and notable figures from that world, but I don't so I tend to skip over those articles.

Interspersed between these nuggets of auto knowledge are other articles that deal with esoteric but informative tidbits from the automotive arena.  For instance the same issue that brought us the above mentioned articles offered up an excellent 2-page article on the past, present and future of the spark plug!  Not exactly need to know information, but for anyone with a keen interest in the internal combustion engine--like me--this article hit the spot.

When the final page is turned is ""Road & Track Magazine"" different enough from the other two car periodicals I read to renew my subscription?  In a word: no.  While I certainly enjoy reading the magazines various articles and columns there just isn't enough between the glossy covers to justify renewing the subscription.  I'm just not into the auto racing scene and ""Road & Track Magazine"" is big into Formula 1, NASCAR and other racing related themes.

For raw, general automotive new ""Road & Track Magazine"" is not as good as Motor Trend, Automobile, or Car & Driver.  But with a subscription cost of only $9.97 (or less, over at Magazines.com) per year, you can afford to grab 12 issues and make up your own mind.",4
"Coastal Living is a professionally- made magazine with lots of enticing photographs, personal stories, and general advice on making the most out of life on the coast. The emphasis in Coastal Living is on waterfront property and the events and entertainment that often take place in cities with a large coastal area.

Much of what you read in Coastal Living pertains to better- known waterfront areas in the United States. Such popular destinations as Boston, Miami, New York, Long Island, California, Cape Cod, South Padre Island, and other tourist- oriented places comprise a large portion of the featured articles in this magazine. Many of these places (like New York City) have very expensive waterfront property than can often be next to impossible to buy. But these areas also include lots of tourist activities, which is why they are so frequently highlighted in this magazine.

Besides the well- known destinations, Coastal Living also includes a good number of featured articles on lesser- known places. Many of these lack the fast- pace and the extensive nightlife of the more popular destinations, but they also offer better deals on property and an opportunity to get away from the chaos of the larger cities. Such places as the Delaware coast, Michigan, Ohio's Lake Erie coast, and others are often very quaint and interesting. Also, they offer property that is far more reasonable in price and is often within the affordability range for many buyers.

Much of the properties you see and read about in Coastal Living are quite expensive. But remember- the majority of the homes are on major coastlines, so you can't expect to find them for selling for a low cost. These are high- demand, low supply properties and they vary greatly in price, but they are all expensive. In a popular area, these homes can sell up to the tens of millions of dollars. But in less popular areas, you can sometimes find some bargain prices on waterfront property. For example, Coastal Living has highlighted many Great Lakes properties that are priced very close to the overall U.S. average. They are not as cheap as most areas of the inner cities, no. But they are priced within the reach of many families.

The emphasis in Coastal Living seems to be on properties- both main residences and vacation properties that are adjacent to a major coastline. But there are other items promoted for sale besides property. And much of this other merchandise is also quite costly. In the ""Currents"" section, for example, it is common to find things like lawn furniture, cufflinks, fancy pitchers, and other things selling for many times the usual price. Most of it is intended for those who want a little bit more and are willing (and able) to pay the price.

Coastal Living is a personal magazine. Most of the stories involve families and couples who enjoy the coast. They share with the reader such things as how they keep their homes protected from the sea, what they do for entertainment, how they like to decorate, and why living on the coast means so much to them. Photos of families and couples often grace the pages of these types of articles, giving them a friendly, domestic feel.

Most of what you will find in Coastal Living relates to the United States coast. There is only an occasional article about other coastal areas, like those of Mexico, the Caribbean, and other places. True, you will sometimes find an article about Hawaii or Alaska. But for the most part, Coastal Living tries to keep its journalism concentrated on places that lie within close proximity to the majority of Americans.

Overall, Coastal Living is a very good magazine for people who enjoy vacationing on the coast, finding entertainment on the coast and, of course, living on the coast. The photography and presentation are excellent and it's interesting to read about the big- city life on the coast as well as some of the more ""unknown"" destinations. It provides great reading and a useful reference for people who already live on the coast or who are interested in purchasing waterfront property.",4
"I was most interested in the article titled ""Clean Energy, Dirty Coal"" by James Fallows. I didn't appreciate his gratuitous digs at China, but more importantly, the article meandered on forever without any useful detail or statistics.

""God Help You. You're on Dialysis"" was much better, though covering the topic of those unfortunate enough to require kidney dialysis. Every year, over 100,000 Americans start, and 25% die within 12 months, a fatality rate the writer report as one of the worst in the developed world - despite spending about $77,000/patient, believed to be more than any other nation. Meanwhile, our government has kept secret clinic-specific data that could help patients make better decisions (Medicare agreed to release them after this article), and the two corporate chains dominating the system (DaVita, Fresnius) together earn about $2 billion in operating profits/year. More than 80% are for-profit.

The author reviewed inspection reports for more than 1,500 clinics out of 5,000 from 2002-09, finding reports of filthy or unsafe conditions in almost half the units checked. Sixty clinics had at least five citations for prescription errors. Consequences are seldom meaningful - just 16 clinics were closed from 2000 to 2008.

Italy spends about one-third less than the U.S., and only about 11% die each year, vs. 20% in the U.S. Patients have more than 5X as much contact with their physicians as in the U.S. Patients start dialysis sooner than in the U.S.

The 'good news' is that Medicare is now moving to improve dialysis care.

""Your Child Left Behind"" reports on a study by Hanushek that compares individual American states with foreign countries, looking at 15-year-old students ranked as the best at math in each location. Only 6% of U.S. students perform at the advanced-proficiency level in math, lagging some 30 other nations, including Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea, Finland, Switzerland, Belgium, and Netherlands, in that order. OECD nations trailing us included only Portugal, Greece, Turkey, and Mexico. Massachusetts ranks as the best state, behind 16 other nations. Even restricting U.S. students to whites or those with at least one college-educated parent put New York below Poland's all children, and Illinois' pupils with at least one college-educated parent performed lower than all students in Iceland, France, Estonia, and Sweden.

On a per student basis, we spend more than all but Luxembourg, Switzerland, and Norway.",4
"The Atlantic is an intellectual magazine and one that I have been reading on and off for many years. This magazine is best known for its political/current events/social articles that tackle some tough issues of the day and it delivers most effectively when it's offering some commentary on world events and social issues and these are the articles I turn to first when I read The Atlantic. I like the political articles best, but there are plenty of other non- political yet very thoughtful articles in each issue.
Most every article in The Atlantic is thoughtful and well- written. Look closely at the authors of some of the stories in this magazine and you will notice some high- profile names on more than one occasion. Christopher Hitchens, Mark Bowden, Eric Schlosser, and others are known to contribute an article or two in each issue of The Atlantic. These writers, and others like them, are ready to offer their take on some of the critical issues of the day.

The Atlantic certainly offers some interesting, thoughtful, intellectual articles and one fact that sets them apart from those found in most other magazines is that the featured articles are often very long- sometimes exceeding ten pages in length. Most magazines shy away from articles this long because they know that most reader's have an attention span that is far too short to finish the entire piece of reading in one sitting. But The Atlantic is different. If the subject matter is such that an article needs to be ten- plus pages in order to thoroughly cover everything, then The Atlantic is quick to oblige. I appreciate the excellent coverage but I must admit that some articles are almost too long. Even when I have an interest in the subject matter, I often end up stopping halfway through because I cannot hold my attention any longer.

Another section I like in The Atlantic is the book reviews section. To present a fair and balanced perspective, The Atlantic reviews new books from many different genres and I like that there are different reviews of varying lengths. One section of The Atlantic called Cover to Cover includes short summaries of many different books. These are nice when you don't have time to read a lengthy review of a book and just want the basics. But there are also some very long book reviews in The Atlantic, along with some advertisements for new books that include a short, 50 to 100 word summary of the book. I like reading the reviews, but I like this section best for its exposure to new book releases. It is like looking at a quick rundown of intellectual books and I have, in fact, discovered some very good titles from this part of the magazine.

Overall, The Atlantic ranks among my favorite magazines and I look forward to some serious, intellectual reading in each issue. I admit that some articles are a tad too lengthy, but I still like The Atlantic for its intellectual stimulation and for its focus on current events. It's a very good magazine for cerebral types who like to read about politics and social issues.",4
"Bottom-Line: When all is said and done I have to admit that I enjoy reading ""Esquire Magazine;"" who knows the magazine just might make me a better man!

The world of men's magazines is festooned with glossy covers adorned with half dressed woman and mostly vapid content geared toward the more Neanderthal and or juvenile among us.  In a world filled with Maxim and Stuff magazines, ""Esquire"" magazine stands out as a periodical with substance, style and intellect, but at the same time is not afraid to feature a beautiful woman on the cover and within it glossy folds.

""Esquire Magazine,"" whose tag line is Man at His Best, was founded in 1933 and is published monthly by the venerable Hearst Corporation.  The magazine has a long history of featuring noted authors of their day, including Malcolm Muggeridge, William F. Buckley, and Truman Capote among other notables.

However, ""Esquire Magazine"" is known and has been known as much for its artsy cover designs as its high-brow content and had given birth to a few notable art designer careers.  To this date the cover of ""Esquire,"" remains a work of art with big bold colors, and larger than life personas framed by flowing text.  The covers alone rival another venerable men's magazine--Playboy--in style and sex appeal.  The only difference is that ""Esquire"" gives equal deference to men on its covers, though they--thankfully--are not shown in various stages of undress.

""Esquire Magazine""--a monthly publication, is a striking combination of the trivial and useful information, from its (mostly) useless monthly column The Guide to Sex to the interesting 10 Things You Don't Know about Women, written by a different female celeb, which I find somewhat useful.  The first third of the magazine is devoted to these little nuggets of information designed to help craft a better man.

In addition to the monthly Features section, Esquire also includes a rather lengthy and engaged celebrity interview; this month it is Angelina Jolie, two months ago it was the delectable Halle Barry.  Some might find these sort of celeb-driven interview trite, given the massive print and video coverage already afforded far too many so-call celebrities, but there is something to be learned from the oft-candid gab-fests with the stars.

But, ""Esquire Magazine"" because it is a men's magazine, does pay homage to barely dressed, well crafted (meaning air-brushed) women within it covers, just not so many as, say Maxim or Stuff, but they are well represented.  And ""Esquire Magazine"" in not above objectifying women as its yearly Sexist Woman Alive anointment clearly shows.  The reigning queen Scarlett Johansson is set to give up her crown soon to a new winner, so the magazine has started drooping clues as to who the next winner will be; it is up to us to figure out who before the moniker is bestowed upon another blonde-haired, blue eyed American beauty; women of color need not apply it seems.

However, If the two latter magazines take the stance that the way to a man's mind it through his eyeballs and groin, ""Esquire Magazine"" appeals to a higher sensibility hinting that men might just learn a thing or two from the fairer sex, thus elevating the intellectual discourse between the genders.

And great writing is still at the forefront of the magazines agenda.  If the first third of the rag is dedicated to the snippet, the later half is devoted to lengthy articles, with little or no commercial interruption (YES!).  Excerpts from novels written by both males and females find a home within ""Esquire Magazine"".  And authors, both known and unknown grace the pages.

But there are investigative articles as well, which I less compelling but, but welcome nonetheless.  A recent article featured a man who is now in charge of security at a major nuclear power plant in the U.S. who used to work for Blackwater as a paid gun for hire.  The article portrays the man as something more than a macho ape with a gun for hire; he is given a decidedly human face and heart, which I found oddly engaging.

Conclusion

When all is said and done I have to admit that I enjoy reading ""Esquire Magazine"".  When I first picked one up years ago I was convinced that there was nothing for me within its (somewhat) high brow pages, but I have come to enjoy the magazines style and substance, though I must admit that most of the advertising is not designed for someone of my limited financial station; yes I make a good living, but little of my current income is disposable enough to by a $500.00 wrist watch even if I wore them, which I don't.

But if you are banned (for whatever reason) from reading the quintessential male magazine, Playboy, ""Esquire Magazine"" comes in close second, followed by GQ.  If you are looking for a magazine written for the not-so-average Joe, filled with those little tidbits in life only men can appreciate, but also brings a healthy infusion of intelligent to its well written and information pages, Esquire Magazine might be for you.  Now that I have started my subscription ($10.00 for a year from Magazines.com), I doubt I will let it lapse, it is turning out to be just that good. And who knows ""Esquire Magazine"" just might make me a better man!",4
"First off.  I ordered this for $5 from amazon while on special.  Takes about 2-3 months to get the first issue (which it clearly states when ordering).

There are some interesting articles, many intended for beginners.  Since the vast majority of yoga students are beginners, they are definitely hitting the target market.  But being a very advanced practitioner, I wasn't expecting too much from this magazine.  I was slightly surprised though from several of the peripheral articles.  That is, the articles not about the actual physical activity of yoga, but about the mind and lifestyle associated with.  Things like adding Feng Shui to your abode or tips for vacationing or improving wellness.

That is why I actually give it some good stars.  The one less star than perfect is because this magazine has TONS of ads.  Lots.  And many are for companies and products that many yoga students could care less about... Though some are of interest.  I don't mind some Lululemon and Gaiam ads, but flip through one issue and you see that nearly 2/3 of the magazine is ad space...  But I guess that's where the money is.  Not in the $5 to $15 per year subscriptions.

Also of note:  9 issues.  Not 12 for a year.  Just fyi.

If you know what you're getting with this periodical, then it's a good thing to have.  Just don't be shocked that the poses mentioned are pretty basic, or some of the fundamentals are covered over and over again.  It's meant for the beginner.  I have a couple of books that have more advanced information and those are what I use for improving my alignment in poses:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Athlete-s-Guide-to-Yoga-An-Integrated-Approach-to-Strength-Flexibility-and-Focus/dp/193403004X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Athlete's Guide to Yoga: An Integrated Approach to Strength, Flexibility, and Focus</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Optimal-Health-for-a-Vibrant-Life-A-30-Day-Program-to-Detoxify-and-Replenish-Body-and-Mind/dp/1451548435/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Optimal Health for a Vibrant Life: A 30-Day Program to Detoxify and Replenish Body and Mind</a>.  Both excellent for those who are beyond a beginner level.  But for $5 I'm happy.",4
"For most of us, Microsoft Office is the de-facto standard of office suites, with Word being the predominant program. It wasn't always this way, as those who have been computer users for some years will remember well. In fact, we may have all been running WordPerfect Office with its affiliated programs if it wasn't for some strange twists in computer history beginning in the 1990s.

There are a number of variations of this Microsoft Office suite that can be found here, but this review is specifically focused on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Office-365-Home-Premium/dp/B009SPTUW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Office 365 Home Premium</a>. This version is is a one-year subscription downloaded from 'Net by entering a product key card, and is licensed for up to five users on PCs, Windows 8 tablets, and Macs (with some limitations - see the specs). It offers the current versions of Word, Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Publisher, Access and more.

Please note: I had previously installed the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Office-Home-Business-2013-Key-Card-1PC-1User/dp/B009SPWJ98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Office Home & Business 2013 Key Card 1PC/1User</a>&nbsp;version on a Window 7 PC notebook, and that version had worked quite well. The annual subscription to Office 365 Home Premium became a worthy option for a new PC running Windows 8 as a development/test system for both hardware and software, so when it came to making a decision as to which suite to go with, curiosity won out.

Here are the highly-subjective likes and dislikes found so far with this installation of the new Office 365 Home Premium suite for those looking for just the key points, then followed with some expanded details.

 Likes:

+ Very smooth installation; simple directions, easy to follow, almost effortless
+ Clean interface; smooth and minimalist, ribbon can be collapsed as needed
+ Operates on five PCs or Macs; license for single household with multiple users
+ Excellent Outlook integration; works well with Outlook.com, Gmail and private email
+ SkyDrive; allows for access of files on the cloud, file sharing when needed
+ Easy customization once installed; make it work your way

 Rants & Irritants:

- Full ALL CAPS menu tabs; don't like having the Metro-style jammed down my throat

 Installation:

The setup is simple and easy to follow. Included in the small box are the directions and a 25-character Product Key card. Go to the Microsoft Office site as indicated, enter the characters from the card as noted, then sign into or create your Microsoft account. Users who already have an Outlook account (possibly converted over from Hotmail) can start with that. Then it's a simple scenario of following the on-screen directions, and the entire installation should be finished in under 30 minutes.

Found the interface to be much cleaner than my older Office 2007 running on another older computer, and with the exception of the CAPS ON menu tabs noted above, it was a good improvement. Though I did not do any precise stopwatch timings, Office 365 seemed to load faster and smoother. The ribbon menu can be collapsed or expanded as needed. When you open up Word, Excel, PowerPoint or Publisher, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document, which is just an extra click away.

What follows are some subjective notes about the various components found within this Office 365 Home Premium suite. I won't attempt to go too heavy into each of these as one could write a full review on most of the modules by themselves, but consider these as observations found from a few weeks use.

 SkyDrive:

I like SkyDrive and have been using it for some time. This has been integrated quite well within Office 365 Home Premium, and has built in resilience against jittery Internet connections. Should you should lose your connectivity while working on a file opened from a SkyDrive account, Office 365 saves it temporarily on your local hard drive before synchronizing with SkyDrive at a later point in time. And what is good is that it syncs quite well so that you can retrieve/edit documents (or images) from other computers once you're logged in.

 Word:

The features for Word have remained largely the same as those in Office 2007 and those that I've found working on clients' Office 2010 installations. Documents often need to be edited after they are written, and Word 2013 makes the editing process easier with such new features such as the ability to edit PDF files. Previously, you needed to install third-party software, such as Adobe Acrobat. This was available to those of us who have been running Word for Mac 2011 where it does a respectable job, but is new to the PC version. Have not had much time to play with it, but if it works as well as the Mac version, then this will be a big help.

Among the new additions that I've found are that you can watch embedded videos right there within the document, and without having to go to a different application. If you work with collaborative documents, you can reply within comments and those replies will be displayed in threaded conversation style.

 Excel:

On a personal note, I have had a love/hate relationship with spreadsheet programs in general since the days of Microsoft Multiplan and Lotus 1-2-3, both of which are distant history now. That being said, Excel has been a program of choice for years now, and one that I've used to input table data into Word and as a flat file database for quite some time. Entering data into spreadsheets can be a tedious and boring chore, so the downward fill feature in Excel that allows you automatically fill the cells in each row with the same number by dragging down has been an ally.

But now there's a new Flash Fill feature that recognizes patterns in your data functions, then automatically fills in the rest of the spreadsheet, and complex formulas are not necessary. You can make it automatically format names the same way (such as last, first, middle initial) just by giving it some examples. Phone numbers can be converted to a uniform format, such as (212) 555-1212, and restore the leading zero to zip codes is a breeze. Look for the Flash Fill button on the Data tab and try it. It's well worth it.

 OneNote:

This is probably one of the most overlooked and underrated components of the Office suites. First encountered it in Office 2007, and it became a handy way to keep simple notes and such, but it was limited. The new version will allow you to embed Excel spreadsheets and see the preview within your note. When you update the spreadsheet, the preview automatically updates, as well. Searching within OneNote is better, as you can now search for words that are embedded in graphics files.

 PowerPoint:

There's a new, cleaner look to PowerPoint. You can start a new presentation using a theme, a template, an older presentation or a more recent one, as well as a blank one. New users should find PowerPoint 2013 to be more intuitive than older versions, and those who are experienced PowerPoint pros will find that everything seems to go smoother. I pulled up some old presentations, including one that was from the late 1990s, and found that doing a few edits was a very smooth process. The themes now come with variations, so tightening up on the look you want is simpler.

 Outlook:

There's an openness to this upgraded version. Outlook is a powerful module, but it will take new users a bit of time to learn to navigate among all of the functions and to understand the numerous toolbar icons, as I found out when showing mine to a colleague. I've been using Outlook under Office for Mac 2011 on a MacBook Pro, and never had an issue with Outlook on the OS X platform. I'm currently trying to sync the two versions as much as possible.

 Publisher:

I personally use Publisher infrequently at this point. Like the other modules in Office 365, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document.

 Access:

The Office Access relational database management system was a product that at one time was a favorite when I was converting over from dBase III many years ago. Speaking honestly, I have not accessed this module, and pardon the pun.

 Annoyances & Irritants:

My primary gripe with the new Office suites has to do with the full ALL CAPS menu tabs, and I'm trying my best to see if I can learn to adapt or if I'll change it. As noted earlier, I don't like the ""new"" Microsoft Metro style being jammed down my throat without the option to change it easily. It's essentially the same one that we find on the Office pages on the Web. There is a workaround, but it must be done in each individual Office 2013 module that you use: go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon, then use the Rename button on each one of the main menu items listed in the right pane under Customize the Ribbon. Instead of changing the name, however, add a space to the end of the name, and then click OK. When you return to the Home tab, the ribbon menu items will be displayed in a title case, with only the first letter capitalized. You can also go back to the ALL CAPS default by resetting them.

 Suggestions:

Putting this simply, if you're happy with Office 2007 or 2010, you may want to weigh your choices between the various versions here, read some of the reviews that best apply to your own needs, then decide whether you wish to keep the earlier version or go for the upgrade. My decision to try Office 365 was based on the fact that it was going to be a 'clean' install on a new Windows 8 PC and that I had a year to use it and see if it was worth the subscription, or if it might be better to go with a 'regular' license for another version. My installation went smoothly and it works well; your results may differ from mine.

I have not tried an installation on a Windows 7 PC to date, but have been largely impressed with how well it runs on a standard, out-of-the-box Windows 8 PC. Please note: this review will be dynamic in that as I find experiences worth sharing, be they pro or con, they will be appended to this review. Other findings or additional resources may be listed in the comments.

 Summary:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Office-365-Home-Premium/dp/B009SPTUW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Office 365 Home Premium</a>&nbsp;as a one year subscription for five users/computers has proven to be an interesting choice for my needs as noted in this review. Please keep in mind that with such a program, your needs and mine may differ, as we each use such office suites in different fashions. Currently I'll rate this suite at a solid 4-star product that can be recommended on the Windows 8 platform.

"""Secret of the Old Clock"" is probably among the most unique Nancy Drew games. This game was released in 2005, and in honor of her 75th anniversary, this game was released. Its title comes from the first Nancy Drew book ever published, and the story itself is a mix of the first four Nancy Drew books ever published (""The Secret of the Old Clock"", ""The Hidden Staircase"", ""The Bungalow Mystery"", and ""The Mystery at Lilac Inn""). To add to the feeling of authenticity, ""Secret of the Old Clock"" takes place in 1930, the year that the book was published.

In this game, a young woman named Emily Crandall has asked Nancy to drive out to her Lilac Inn to meet her, saying she'd like her to do her a favor. This takes Nancy by surprise, as she doesn't really know Emily aside from their mutual friend Helen Corning. However, thoughtful as she is, Nancy accepts.

When Nancy drives out to the Inn, she meets Emily's guardian Jane Willoughby, who is legally responsible for Emily now that Gloria Crandall (her mother) has passed away (her father died in battle years ago). Jane tells Nancy that Emily has been acting strangely, but Nancy dismisses this, thinking that she's probably full of grief and stress after losing her mom and trying to run the inn on her own.

Nancy goes upstairs to meet with Emily in her room. Emily tells Nancy that she'd like her to lock her mother's jewelry up in a safe, to keep it safe from all of the ""weird things"" that have been happening around the Inn lately. Nancy's curiosity gets going about these ""weird things"", but she has little time to ask before the stove in the kitchen ignites!

Nancy, Emily, and Jane all run out to escape the fire. The fire department arrives in time to save the Lilac Inn, but not in time to save the stove. With the stove gone, the Lilac Inn will no longer be able to serve its famous pies, meaning it could have to shut down for good. Not only that, but the priceless jewelry was stolen in the midst of it all!

All of the financial trouble that was happening in the 30's (the game takes place right before the Great Depression) and lack of a stove makes Emily blurt out that she wishes Josiah Crowley - a rich old man who'd recently passed away - had left her money in his will like he said he would. When Nancy asks about this, she learns that Mr. Crowley had promised he'd leave various people who he cared about money when he died, but when his will was found, they were left nothing and all of his belongings went to an ESP expert named Richard Tompham.

Just what happened to the jewelry? Why did the stove ignite? Is the will that was found the true will of Josiah Crowley? If so, why would a sweet old man like him break his promises? Nancy's now determined to find out the truth by solving her first case...

The storyline is pretty strong, and actually flowed very impressively, which I imagine would be hard to do when combining *four* stories into one. The mystery does eventually branch off into two or three different cases in and of itself, but it's actually all weaved together rather nicely by the end. The ending was very good, and I really can't complain about how things turned out at all.

I rather liked being able to explore and sneak around the Lilac Inn, as well as a few other places, like Josiah Crowley's old house (now inhabited by Topham) and the town's bank. This is also the first game to use the driving feature, which gives the player the ability to ""drive"" around Titusville (the name of the city the game's taking place in) by controlling the car from an areal view with their mouse. I had mixed feelings about the driving feature, as it does get hard to control and it's possible to lose the game if a flat tire isn't properly taken care of.  Still, it was also a cute little feature that was fun to include in a game. I do miss seeing everything from Nancy's perspective, though...

The puzzles were fun, and I liked the majority of them, but some of them were pretty hard to get through and felt like they rewarded little. The golfing challenge in particular was extremely hard to get through, and I'd say I spent at least a good half hour trying to win that section of the game alone. The sewing challenge was also pretty hard the first time around, but I felt it was easier once I got the hang of it.

Since the game does take place in 1930, there are lots of modern luxuries that were in previous games that did not appear in this game. For example, Nancy doesn't have a cell phone, and has to drive back to the Lilac Inn to use the coin phone on the porch whenever she wants to make a call. The phone friends in this game were nice, and this is the first (and so far, only) game in which Nancy has the ability to call her dad for hints and insight into the case. I really liked having Carson Drew in the game, and I'm hoping he makes his second appearance soon.

Speaking of the coin phone - that's another new feature employed in this game. This is the first game to employ the use of money, and Nancy must pay to get various tasks done (i.e. paying for more gas, buying things for other people, etc.). It's possible to run low on money, but Nancy can also drive around town delivering telegrams in exchange for some money. Delivering telegrams can get tedious at times, but the small conversations that are always sparked between Nancy and the person she's delivering the telegram to always brought about some comedic relief. Some of them were actually pretty funny.

The characters were well-integrated, and all seemed to have good reason to be the culprit. I wasn't sure who necessarily would be the culprit at the end, but there was enough to make me suspect everybody at times (even Emily). The culprit choice was actually rather surprising, and employed a move that'd never been used before when explaining the culprit's motive. While some may have their doubts about this, I felt it was rather nicely written into the story and made the game even more unique.

The suspects in this game include Emily Crandall, a 17-year-old orphaned girl who seems to have been losing her marbles ever since her mother died and feels like she's incapable of running Lilac Inn. Jane Willoughby was Gloria Crandall's best friend from years ago, and is currently acting as Emily's guardian until she turns 18; she's trying to convince Emily to sell the Inn thinking that she should take advantage of her youth while she still has it. Jim Archer is Emily's banker who seems to be a little evasive about the situations going on at the Lilac Inn, and also thinks Emily should sell the Inn before the bills start getting too high. Richard Topham is Josiah Crowley's former ESP trainer who's residing in Josiah's old house, who's inherited all of Crowley's belongings and views the Crandalls and Mr. Archer as selfish people who only loved Josiah because he had a lot of money.

""Secret of the Old Clock"" has a rather nice selection of music. None of it was my own personal cup of tea, because I prefer scarier music. The game does feature some nice 30's music, though. All of it complimented the game itself, and I think that the soundtrack really couldn't get much better than it already is.

Is ""Secret of the Old Clock"" as strong of a game as most of the classic 13 Nancy Drew games? No. I do miss seeing everything from Nancy's perspective, and some of the puzzles and challenges were very hard and frustrating. However, is it a bad game? Most definitely not! The story is wonderful, and I really liked the cast. It still features more first person exploration than a lot of the more recent games do, and it still holds the feel-good ""classic Nancy Drew game"" feeling that the first 13 games had. While this wouldn't be my top recommendation for a Nancy Drew game, it'd definitely still be high up in my gaming recommendations, and should be played by anybody who wants to play all of the ""good"" Nancy Drew games or those who want to take a blast into the past and catch a cunning criminal by finding out the secret surrounding the old clock. :) 4 stars for this gem of a game!",4
"I usually assemble my own PCs, but this spring, I decided to gamble on a factory machine. Being a gamer and an artist, I wanted a good performance rig festooned with removable storage ports and cable jacks. So I picked up an HP Media Center and discovered Windows Vista.

Vista Home Premium is to Windows XP as XP was to the Windows 9x series. In other words, I think it's a leap: one of Microsoft's most radical changes in interface, capability, and security that I've experienced. And I've laid my hands on almost every Windows OS since 1992.

Enough so that I find Vista to be superfluous despite its changes. XP users in particular need not apply (an upgrade that is, yuck yuck!).  But for anybody who's looking to finally replace that trusty old copy of 98 Second Edition, or who wants to jump on the multiprocessor, dual video card, high-def graphic experience, then this is the system for you. Just beware--here there be bugs and compatibility issues.

->DOWN TO DETAILS<-

Despite all my talk about big leaps, there is nothing that Vista does that XP users can't do without. Home Premium bundles a number of apps `n' applets that XP must apply separately, but nevertheless is able to apply. Otherwise, the remaining differences are pretty looking, but pretty useless.

>Aeroplane and Horsepower

Such as a new ""glass"" interface called Aero. Everything about it, including the cute sidebar, the marble Start button, and fancy-pants window switching, windows thumbnail, and windows sizing effects--looks better than the ""Fisher Price"" XP. Or any previous version of Windows, for that matter. Vista runs simple effects, such as color-coding file names to indicate a compressed file. And more complex effects: hover the mouse pointer over a program in the taskbar, and a cute little thumbnail screenshot pops up; while hitting the ""switch window"" button in the quick launch box will stack full size pics of your open programs to sort through.

This interface is one of the shallow leaps from XP. It doesn't have much utility but it sure looks like it needs hardware to run. Except Aero ran just fine on my low-range, low powered graphics card installed by the factory: an NVIDIA OEM 7500 LE. And I have confirmed that it will run, if a bit sluggishly, on a single gig of RAM with a modest dual-core processor. Vista also comes preloaded with Direct X 10, which itself is supposed to be a revolution in graphics processing. Since I have no DX10 programs other than Vista, I can't tell you whether this matters or not.

>Stability

What might matter to the performance minded user: stability. I've only used Vista for a couple of months, but I have suffered no OS crashes or freezes. Unlike XP which, while the most stable Windows of its time, still bugged out on me at least once a month. Individual programs still crash or fail to respond--notably AOL and Word 2007. Also, closing a program sometimes triggers a ""Stopped Working"" error message, but I detect no actual harm and I can load such a program right back up. So far Vista has taken every peripheral, drive, and PC card I've thrown at it. On a down note, VHP is so big that a Norton virus scan or disk defrag takes roughly twice as long as it did in XP.

Update 15 AUG 2007: After installing my PSU and graphic card, I noticed system hangs at startup. These seem to be resolved after a recent update. Also, the aforementioned app crashes have been resolved by updates.

Now, in performance, I include the improved power options. Three pre-set states exist: from high-performance/low-savings, to a balanced system, to energy efficiency but low performance. Additionally, the low-power states of previous Windows have been combined in a newish ""Sleep"" mode. According to my documentation, putting the computer into Sleep mode is actually preferable to shutting down the system every night, presumably because Vista runs a number of maintenance programs when I am not looking. These power settings integrate with my monitor's own energy program, incidentally.

>Security

Speaking of management, Vista includes User Account Controls, which basically asks your permission every...single...time...you attempt to install a program, uninstall a program, or run any sort of program which significantly affects the performance of Windows. As an XP veteran myself, I just turn this annoying feature off, since there is currently no scalability to this control (that is, I can't order it what to watch and what to ignore). Vista also has a detailed file sharing security system, to the extent that even an Administrator account can be denied permission to move that Metallica MP3 from your Download folder to your KigAzz Musik folder. No, really, it is that buggy and intrusive.

>Bells n Whistles

Vista also comes preloaded with its own firewall, calendars, news tickers, and system monitors that XP users can separately plug in. Annoyingly, Vista itself has no CPU temperature widget--I have to go into my BIOS for that.

What I think is more useful are all the inherent, if generic, multimedia applications. Vista Home Premium supports HD DVD and HDTV. And users can access their media, including music and video files as well as television, through a Windows Media Center interface. VHP includes generic video capture capability, generic movie editing, generic DVD home movie burning, generic picture gallery, and of course, those old stalwarts, Paint and Sound Recorder (Note that the capabilities of Sound Recorder have been greatly reduced, to the point that in premium it can only record in .wma format and with no onboard editing or sound effect capability). The interface itself is reorganized to include more recognition for gamers. All of your games can be found in a dedicated tab within the Start menu.

Speaking of gamers, Vista is supposed to support games in other ways as well. There's the new Games for Windows protocol, which I really don't know much about, in addition to the graphics support. DX10, incidentally, includes a number of back-compatible Direct3D APIs to support XP-era programs. Games like *Oblivion* run like a dream, while the infamous audio stutter bug of *Half-Life 2* is actually worse than on my XP rig.

Keep in mind also that many new hardware devices still support XP. My new NIVIDA 8600 GTS, for example, includes DX9.0c and supports such systems, even though it is a DX10 card.

->SEND OUT THE BUGS<-

Unfortunately, none of this seems to be enough for *Max Payne* and *Max Payne 2*, which I have been unable to get going on VHP. And that leads me to the compatibility issues. The Windows Upgrade Advisor utility isn't entirely accurate about what software will run well in Vista. I had to replace all of my Norton Software, and I was disgusted to discover that the 2007 edition of SystemWorks still wasn't Vista compatible! And yet, my ancient copy of Adobe Photoshop LE 5.0 functions well enough. My old Canon Zoombrowser has some graphic issues with the buttons, but the pictures themselves appear just fine.

Not so fine are some media limitations. Home Premium includes Windows Media Player 11. This program will write album tags to newly ripped .WAV files. However, old .WAV files cannot be tagged, and will be permanently lumped together under the ""Unknown Album"" section. Because officially, WMP 11 does not support metadata for WAV, just .wma and MP3. Even though it can write in .WAV format. That's just stupid.

Plus, I hate the fact that burning a CD in WMP continues to automatically insert a pause between tracks. Apparently, Bill Gates has never heard a music album that segues, such as almost everything ever published by Frank Zappa and Trent Reznor.

VHP also has some bug issues. As confirmed on the Microsoft support site, wakening the computer from a low-power state causes digital audio drivers to malfunction. In my case, it fills my speakers with static. Three Windows Updates, including the newest one posted on 10 July 2007, have not solved this problem. I found two solutions on my own:

*I can reboot, which is annoying whenever I need to get back on the computer after an absence, such as sleeping, eating, and otherwise living my life.

*Or I can stop using digital audio altogether. Specifically by running analog cables from the speaker outputs of my computer to the multichannel inputs of my receiver, and then telling my computer's sound manager to run speaker audio as the default device. Since *Half-Life 2* only supports analog surround sound anyways, this is no real loss. Except I think it is stupid that a game will happily use stereo cables to support my 5.1 setup, but refuses to use my digital cable for anything except stereo!

->THE BOTTOM LINE<-

Vista is ideal for some and excessive for others.

XP with SP2 is still a current and capable OS, with a third service pack on the way. Microsoft will continue mainstream support until about 2009. So after spending hundreds, if not thousands of dollars on XP compatible software, you might as well get your money's worth and keep using it. Especially since Vista's successor is already in the works, XP users can safely wait a couple more years.

This is true even for security-minded users. The new account restrictions are appropriate for an actual network that can be accessed by multiple people. You will still need a third party anti-virus and spyware program. For everybody else, XP with Service Pack 2 and regular updates will protect your Jenna Jameson pics and household budgets just fine.

Likewise, those who are serious about media will not need Vista's limited programs. You `ll be looking for more capable products from third party vendors, such as Nero, Paint Shop Pro, or Final Cut. Bleeding-edge gamers and graphic artists will likely appreciate the increased graphics capability, especially since a handful of DX10 games are due this fall, but like physics cards, I wouldn't consider this a must-have tech until 2008.

However, those who are buying their first computer, or who need to replace a much older OS, will benefit from the change in just about every respect: from stability to out-of-the-box capability. You will lose support for some old programs, especially those written before 2002, but those probably need to be replaced anyways. Vista also requires considerably more memory and hard drive space, so those running an older OS are probably in a position to require a hardware upgrade as well.

Finally, Vista Home Premium is ideal for those who want to get their 21st Century Geek on, especially when coupled with a multimedia, high-framerate, high-def death rig. Rrrr! I'm a truck! (Sorry, I just had to throw in a Wildman Fisher reference).

My Specs: PCIe x 16 SATA mobo, Intel Core 2 Duo E6600 2.4 Ghz; 3 GB of PC2 5300 SDRAM, and a 256 MB  DX10 compatible video card, running off a 500w PSU (This is a mid range PC by today's gaming standards, but it still kicks it out).",4
"I'm a longtime user of Office 2003 with Outlook and was eager to try out this upgrade for Outlook as it's the application I use the most (other than Access which I use for my software development projects routinely). I really didn't have any need to upgrade the other applications, so this stand-alone was perfect for me. I actually don't use Outlook for email generally, preferring to use the standalone email open source product Thunderbird which gives me a lot more ability to customize and add other features to (and since I don't have to connect to an Exchange server or anything else that specifically forces me to use Outlook.) So I personally was not put off by the fact that things like spell check will not work if you use Outlook 2007 with the rest of the Office 2003 suite. That's been well documented here by other reviewers, so I won't go into it.

Putting those issues aside, this is a really nice upgrade. A lot of upgrades are sort of ""so what"", but this one really impressed me. First, the look and feel of it is much more polished. It's more than just a pretty face, I find the items on my calendar for instance much more striking and easier to see what I have coming up at a glance. While the install itself seemed endless, the final product does seem to run plenty fast enough on my machine (it's fairly high end, 8 GHz, 3 gig of RAM) older machines may have more problems. Outlook 2007 uses a different style of toolbar than older versions, I really like the new toolbar, with the tabbed panels and fancier icons, it's just a matter of getting used to it. Here are some highlights from the different sections of Outlook, things that I specifically like or don't like. Please note that in some cases, I may be mentioning things that are possible to do with customization...however, they are not things that are easy for the average user to figure out, particularly since the product comes with basically no documentation at all, other than typical Microsoft Help.

1. Email - as mentioned, I don't really use this much, but it *does* include a really nice RSS reader with a large list of feeds you can add immediately. Ironically, the one for Outlook 2007 is wrong, it adds the Outlook 2003 feed, I went to the Microsoft site to find the link for the correct one. One thing I also noticed is that when you are in Email, or any other area of Outlook other than the Calendar, there is a new ""To Do"" bar that displays all your upcoming appointments and tasks, and a field to create new tasks. Really great new feature.

2. Calendar - I really like the way appointments look as mentioned. Also there are now very clear Day - Week - Month buttons at the top, these were not as easily found in the previous version. I do find it funny that there is still no Year view. I can do this with calendar apps on my tiny Pocket PC, it seems ridiculous that I can't see a yearly overview, or at least a 3 month overview on my desktop. Also, there doesn't seem to be a way to customize the number of lines for appointments on the monthly calendar. If you don't have large numbers of appointments, it'd be nice to show 2 lines so you can read the whole appointment, as you can on the weekly view. In particular, this would be nice when printing calendars, rather than holidays and birthdays that are all chopped off. I did notice that I have spell check available when creating appointments, so clearly it's available for at least some functions. I also though ran into issues with Outlook not wanting to save my appointment when I was editing it and trying different options...but it didn't give me any really detail as to why, just kind of a random thing.

3. Contacts - In additional to the new interface, you've got all kinds of new stuff you can add and link with contacts. There's some neat new options, such as a link to go to the address on MSN maps, open their webpage in your browser, total customization of the business card for the contact, etc. You can add images to their contact notes, as well as a variety of other things like charts and graphs if you have the rest of Office 2007. I did notice as well that I can now sort my contacts by category. This drove me nuts in the 2003 version, that it would not sort by category, so very glad to have it now!

4. Tasks - Fairly similar to the changes with contacts, lots of additional things you can link to the task, I like being able to paste in the business card of the contact for the task, for instance. You can also link the task over to an account in the Business Contact Manager

5. Notes are still a bit more basic than I care for, but I use OneNote so only use these rarely now. It's definitely easier now to group them into categories, color code them, sort them, etc. but very basic functionality. OneNote is so superior in every way, but unfortunately is still sold as a separate product. Kind of a side note here...but I really wish that with many of these parts of Outlook you could add drawings as you can in OneNote, for those of us that have a tablet.

6. Business Contact Manager - So here's the real jewel in this product. I really didn't use the one that came with Office 2003 and only now see how much I was missing! First, to use this it will install SQL Server Express on your machine. I run standard SQL Server from a separate box, so it would have been nice to be given the option to specify a SQL location to use instead of forcing a new install of the server on me. But at least it only starts up when you try to access this section of Outlook, so that reduces the load at least somewhat on your machine. Overall, I'm pretty impressed with how much this does, the name really doesn't do it justice. I'm really putting some time into getting my current accounts, contacts and projects loaded into this, as it basically does the same sort of things that I was using a different project management program to do. Now, this is hardly going to replace a full-fledged, multi-user project management software application. But for a sole proprietor like myself, it does the basics well enough to be useful. I can create projects, enter tasks for the project, add notes and hours worked, view custom reports on my projects, etc. I don't do much sales and marketing at the moment, but that's all in there as well. I really just wish it did even more. I'd like to be able to link files and documents to my tasks, for instance, or at least, include better integration with OneNote, which is ideal for project documents and notes. I found it particularly strange for instance, that in my regular Contacts, I had a link to OneNote to create custom notes for that contact...but I did not have the same button in the Business Contacts (which is where it is *really* needed.) Better integration with OneNote would really be a huge boon to those of us that are using both of these products.

Just as an additional side note, I was glad to see the upgrade did not break my ActiveSync with my SmartPhone, everything still works fine and syncs properly. I did notice that the contacts in the Business Contact Manager do not sync with the PPC, but that's to be expected (just something to be aware of). There's also still a big problem with Outlook and that is the issue of alarms not going off if the program isn't up and running. I always like to have them synced to my phone so I am less likely to miss them just because the program isn't open.

Overall, this is an excellent upgrade, as long as you have a machine that can handle it and are not effected or bothered by the various issues with using it along with the Office 2003 suite. Some improvements to some functions would make it even better, but it is certainly still worth a look.",4
"Bento was released by the makers of FileMaker Pro with a very specific purpose. Interestingly, Bento was the name given to a layer in Apple's visionary OpenDoc architecture launched with System 7.5 in the mid 1990s.

Bento is a personal (as opposed to ""enterprise"" or networked) database that's meant to be as easy to use as the Mac itself. It has a carefully-identified set of features. These run parallel to those of iWork's Pages and Numbers. It could have been called i(Data)Base to aim at a comparable niche in the market. Bento complements Pages and Numbers nicely. The criticisms that some users (and reviewers) leveled at Bento, that it lacked, for example, scripting, Automator and network support, miss the point. It was never intended for those sorts of uses - or those types of users; look at FileMaker Pro for such extended power.

Bento was specifically designed and released without such features in order to concentrate on the less-experienced consumer and SOHO user. Some missing areas of functionality might be useful to the non-specialist user. On the whole, though, the balance between price and feature set, not to mention features, means that Bento can be safely recommended.

Bento is designed to accomplish everyday tasks using a pleasing and straightforward template-based interface The very fact that it is simple, has only one window, and just the right number and design of a few uncluttered menus adds to its accessibility and effectiveness as a flexible and powerful tool.

It only takes a quick glance at the lively, comprehensive and very well supported and moderated Bento forum to see how easy it is to achieve sophisticated date calculations and many-to-many implementation; Bento's apparent simplicity can be deceptive. Bento Users is another useful site. The documentation that comes with the product is excellent.

Everyday
FileMaker has compiled a list of some of the more likely projects that Bento can handle. These include:

* what FileMaker, Inc. calls ""virtually unlimited"" contact details
* coordinating events, parties, and fundraisers
* tracking projects, assignments, and deadlines
* prioritizing tasks; Bento has been used successfully in a Getting Things Done task management context
* inventories, donations, and items for sale
* track hours worked, payments due, invoicing
* rate service providers and sellers
* libraries for music, movies, and media
* store files and photos related to projects and events

and, rather cryptically, since this ought to be part of any good data model:

* connect related information together to see more details.

There are ample standalone products to achieve many of these tasks - Project Managers like OmniPlan and task management - the same company's OmniFocus. Bruji's outstanding BookPedia and CDPedia. There are dedicated time management and billing/invoice suites like TimeNet Pro - though none without some flaw; and iPhoto, Address Book and iCal themselves, with the last two of which Bento integrates closely.

It is what it is
So the criteria for MyMac's evaluation must not be, What's missing from Bento? Rather, how well does this reasonably-priced and robust Leopard-only product do what it's been designed to do?

First and foremost, then, is a courageous - and largely successful - attempt to make database design and management accessible to those who are not specialists or experts in such software, but who still have demanding needs such as some of those just mentioned.

Bento's main window consists of three panes:

The leftmost pane is the Source List of all your data Libraries. Libraries are Bento's top organizational level - like iPhoto 7's ""Events."" One Bento Library is for one set of data or project. Under these in the Source List are Bento's Collections; these are like iTunes' Playlists - subsets of the data in the Libraries. Then Smart Collections behave just as you would expect: they're Views updated in real time and as your filter criteria - or the records that matches them - change. You might, for example, want to create a Smart Collection of all unpaid invoices - as they get paid, they disappear; or of all unsold artifacts in a craft store - as they are sold, they disappear.

The records area is in the middle and is the largest pane. Data can be presented as a form (an individual record) or table of as many records as will fit into the space. You can have more than one form for any Library (each may display different fields - in different orders). This is emphasis on the user experience again; it drives the way you work. Each view is satisfactorily editable - columns can be dragged horizontally for display; you can chose which you will view too. The principles, of course, are analogous to those in FileMaker's ""Align"" routines and fit well with the sophisticated controls that Bento offers.

The Associated fields list for each Library is on the right. Fields are created here and dragged and dropped onto the Records area. There are only three attributes for each. There is also control over how many of these three panes will appear - you can focus on what you're doing.

This is a familiar interface; and it preserves the metaphors for data handling on which Bento rests. Similarly, searching, sorting, and summaries are all swift and intuitive. Searching can be very sophisticated and saved as a Smart Collection.

Note, though, that this means that there's no concept of separate datastores in Bento. All the data which you use Bento to maintain is managed in one place. You can still share Libraries with other users. Yet if you organize your data according to ""domains"" within your life (household, work, hobbies, friends, you may find it a disadvantage to access it all in and from one place by launching the Bento application itself as opposed to separately-located data files. On the other hand, this is very much in keeping with current Mac practice: it is the way that iCal, iPhoto, iTunes, iWeb (though not Pages or Numbers) all work. More evidence of the perceived target audience; for them it is assumed the task in hand is more important than file names, file management.

Data Types
Given these intentional restrictions, the substantial variety of data types (nineteen of them) which Bento handles is impressive: basic text, numbers, dates, drop-downs, Booleans, graphics, sounds, movies, ratings, addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses and more. There's also a FileMaker-like calculation field which can, for example, concatenate text and multiple fields values as well as perform simple mathematical operations. Inevitably there will be some function missing for someone, but on the whole it's comprehensive - and very easy to use.

Templates
For all its transparency, Bento is not a glorified Wizard. Fields can be controlled - use drag and drop. Fields are rearranged and resized with the mouse - usual Mac style. Some positioning and alignment of text is possible using a toolbar - though probably less than most people will come to want: five text sizes, no choice of fonts. One of the biggest hurdles that the marketing of Bento has to overcome is to make it plain that these are flexible means to an end - although the (new) user's first contact with the program will be the 20 templates that come with the software. These templates are shells; they are not one and the same as the data which they are used to present. If the designers of Bento have understood just what it is that a majority of users want in terms of the payoff between interface and ease of use as opposed to in depth functionality, then they have surely got a winner on their hands. The number of downloads (a quarter of a million) in the first few months since Bento became available suggests that is the case.

Address Book and iCal integration
By default Bento has Libraries for contacts, events, and tasks. These are the same as those in Leopard's Address Book and iCal; they are not synched. Although these Libraries can be removed - ""Disconnected"" - from Bento in its ""Home"" menu, to do so is to lose access to those applications' data. What's more, to edit in Bento - or worse delete - data that's derived from Address Book and iCal is to lose it directly from those same applications actually outside the Bento environment. Integration is tight: you could drag and drop a set of contacts from the Address Book Library right into Bento's Source list to create a Collection. This ""disconnection"" could usefully be supplemented by a preference letting you work from a duplicate and/or advising you that you could conceivably lose permanently (unless backed up) data of which you might have thought you were only working on a copy.

Import-Export
Bento supports only CSV (Comma Separated Value) for import and export of data, although there are ways aplenty to convert that after or before the fact. So that's a limitation only inasmuch as you may need another utility and two steps. The importer is drag-and-drop then Wizard-based and worked very well in testing. The Wizard asks which values from the file to be imported should correspond with which fields in Bento.

Relations
The way that Bento handles relations - the fields in other tables whose data you need to appear in the current one - is one of the program's main limitations: it's not a conventional relational database. But, again, it's an approach designed to give the greatest likely desired power with the simplest steps.

In your ""local"" Library you create a field of type ""Related Records List""; then you indicate from which Library you want to use data. Dropping that field on your form displays a small empty table corresponding to the ""remote"" Library. You click the ""Add related records from a list"" icon at the bottom of the inset table to see actual data. Bento displays the corresponding list of records from the associated library. Changing records in the one changes them in the other. Deleting a record in the ""local"" Library only deletes it only from the Related Records List (the ""local"" dataset) and not from the associated Library. This more closely follows the practice of removing a record from a Smart Folder, Collection or Playlist. It's a way of preventing mistakes - although not entirely logical, until you're used to it. It's also another example of ease of use; accessibility takes precedence. Note, too though, that Smart Collections cannot include data from related tables. That may be a significant restriction for some.

What is likely to be a real drawback, though, is the fact that by ""Related Records"" Bento means essentially a ""Portal"" to all the records in the ""remote"" Library. There is no concept of a ""Join"" using Primary and Foreign Keys. This means that you cannot be selective in the way you relate and view such records.

Conclusions
Bento is a package. A compromise. MyMac's advice is that - after reading this review - you match what it can do against your needs. Almost certainly you may have requirements which Bento seems unable to meet. But look closely. Sure, its interface is user-friendly - and more important, perhaps, Bento itself is easy to use. But this doesn't mean it's in any way crippled and ""less than"" comparable databases of this level of complexity - relational features aside.

It's much closer to Pages, Numbers, iPhoto, iTunes in feel and scope than it is to FileMaker. But prolonged use for this review has revealed that Bento can easily be made to do more than might be apparent even from glancing familiarity with the delightful sophistication of the interface.

Given some of the things that Bento can do, there's a remarkably high ratio between effort and result. Whether or not it's for you will depend firstly on whether you have Leopard. Then on your data handling requirements: total size of data set, complexity of relations and perhaps the way (or whether) you use iCal and Address Book. Then you should decide whether one of the absent features (scripting, full control over template fonts, a missing calculation, say) rules it out.

For many users the extremely pleasing appearance of Bento will be a winner. How nice to be able to work in a fully Mac-like environment using an inventory of - car parts.

A balance has been struck: users with complex, evolving and intricately relational databases may still be best with FileMaker Pro. Those for whom the lure of an elegant user interface is important and/or who want a direct equivalent of Numbers, Pages and iPhoto/iTunes and/or seamless integration with iCal and Address Book should look seriously at Bento. Download the trial, use it carefully and draw on the many sources of online help, remember its very reasonable price, decide whether you'll be able to make Bento do a variety of things for you larger than the dedicated software mentioned at the beginning of this review can do - and see!

Pros: the interface - it's good-looking, simple and easy to use; many data types supported; integration with Address Book and iCal; templates work with many types of file; works with iPhone and .Mac

Cons: the interface - the changes you can make to its appearance are somewhat limited; poor relational capabilities; mass updates to records not supported

I have studied and used several languages for work, and Japanese has been on my list for a while.  Like most tools this software should probably be used in combination with other tools.  Learning the Kanji character alphabet will probably be the hardest with the included method.  While it does help you with building a vocabulary, learning the intricacies of the various formal tenses is also something that may need to be augmented.  Still, this is an excellent resource for the serious language learner who wants to learn a little bit at a time. The high cost may stop some people but overall it's probably worth it for those serious about learning Japanese.

The Product

The product that includes the 3 levels is definitely a better value than the single level products, which won't provide enough content to allow even basic speaking ability.  Included you will find:
1) Nice quality printed manuals
2) Software CDs for all 3 levels, beginner, intermediate and advanced
3) Audio companion CDs for all 3 levels, also a huge extra and well worth the extra $50
4) A basic computer headset with headphones and a microphone

Overall, the box seems somewhat small.  But once you see all that's included within it, you will understand where your money went.  There's a lot of content packed on those disks, which is what you pay for.

The Method

The full immersion method forces you to avoid the traditional translation of other learning methods.  The good thing is that it helps you to quickly gain the basics in terms of vocabulary and comprehension. The challenge is of course that you must work much harder to learn grammar and written syntax.  This version does allow you to see and learn some characters along with the lessons, but most serious learners will still want to augment this immersion method with some traditional study too.

The software allows you to focus on language areas.  There is less emphasis on repetition within modules, but you can repeat them as desired if you prefer drills.  The USB headset allows you to repeat phrases and improve your accuracy, which also facilitates learning.  The structure is very good and the integrated visuals along with the audio will allow you to gain confidence quicker than other methods. Since many people learn visually and others learn by hearing, this method allows both groups to learn effectively.

You can also begin to learn to read basic Japanese characters by selecting that option.  The program allows you to select traditional roman characters or Japanese.  There are also exercises that test your comprehension by making selections onscreen.

The method may be overwhelming at first for some people, but is actually easier than traditional learning.  The only qualms I have with it is that I personally do learn a little better with traditional grammar and repetition methods.

The Software

The software is very good, but not error free.  I was somewhat surprised by how demanding it was.  I did experience a few errors that required me to restart the program, as well as some general slowness moving between sections.  I recently upgraded the RAM on my computer, and have had more responsiveness since then.  However, you are limited to installing this on one machine as far as I could tell.  So from that perspective, make sure you install it on a good one that you feel comfortable with.

The audio companions are perhaps more akin to traditional programs I am familiar with.  These have been a great addition for me.  I started out only using the software and have begun to augment with the CDs too.

The Alternatives

The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rosetta-Stone-Version-3-Japanese-Level-1-2-3/dp/B0015ETQ78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rosetta Stone Version 3: Japanese Level 1, 2 & 3</a>&nbsp;version doesn't include the audio companion, but as far as I'm concerned this version is well worth the small premium relative to that one.  Similarly, you can buy each level individually but getting them together is a much better value.
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rosetta-Stone-Version-3-Japanese-Level-1/dp/B00153T0KM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rosetta Stone Version 3: Japanese Level 1</a>,

Coming from somebody who is used to learning a language from a combination of Barron's programs and books, this program is a very welcome addition to my toolbox.  I would still recommend using those other programs to augment your study though.  Particularly, books on characters like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Essential-Kanji-2-000-Basic-Japanese-Characters-Systematically-Arranged-For-Learning-And-Reference/dp/0834802228/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Essential Kanji: 2,000 Basic Japanese Characters Systematically Arranged For Learning And Reference</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Schaum-s-Outline-of-Japanese-Grammar/dp/0071342206/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Schaum's Outline of Japanese Grammar</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Japanese-Kanji-Flashcards-Vol-1-Third-Edition/dp/0974869449/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Japanese Kanji Flashcards, Vol. 1 (Third Edition)</a>&nbsp;are going to be very useful if you need to learn for more than just conversation.

Relatively speaking, I suppose the Pimsleur programs like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Japanese-III-2nd-Ed-Learn-to-Speak-and-Understand-Japanese-with-Pimsleur-Language-Programs-Pimsleur-Language-Program/dp/0743528859/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Japanese III - 2nd Ed.: Learn to Speak and Understand Japanese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Language Program)</a>would be considered comparable in price to these, though they are also more expensive if you buy each level individually.  Relative to those, there is no comparison.  This software approach wins hands down and is actually a better value.

Conclusion

This is a great language program and should do the trick if, like many people, you are not a fan of the traditional memorization method that is common in language learning.  While the investment is significant, it's well worth if you're serious about learning Japanese.

Enjoy!",4
"IMPORTANT UPDATE:  Microsoft will be releasing a new version of Windows Home Server in the 1st half of 2011.  As of December 2010 the announcement is official that the newer version will completely eliminate (and by this I mean ""break"") the way hard drives are managed in the current version.  What this means to you is that if you purchase this version of the Windows Home Server OS, you will be headed for a dead-end if your Windows Home Server hardware does not have its own RAID controller.  There are other workarounds for the issue, but those that I have seen thus far are complicated.  If you are looking at purchasing Windows Home Server, you might want to hold off until the new version comes out, or else commit yourself to staying with this version.

NOTE:  This product has gone far beyond the item listed here and is, as of 12/2009, up to ""Power Pack 3"".  If you cannot find a newer release of this product, make it a point immediately after installation to allow the Server to update itself before trying to properly set up the rest of your Windows Home Server.  It will save you a lot of trouble if you do this because the updates resolve a lot of issues.  Most importantly, Power Pack 3 adds compatibility with Windows 7 and fixes some serious problems with file indexing.

Windows Home Server (or ""WHS"") seems to serve two purposes:

1) to provide a very simple way of doing every useful ""home network"" type of task without having to know much about servers

2) to prevent anyone who is not a home user from trying to use the OS as any sort of formal Windows Server (such as for a business or as a web server)

This means that if you come from a background of managing servers and are used to managing things at the OS level, you really need to let that go. Things that seem like a can't-fail performance tweak or a standard ""best practice"" will actually destabilize Windows Home Server and eventually lead you off to rebuild-land, wondering how things went wrong.  Remoting into a Windows Home Server using anything besides the Windows Home Server Console will corrupt the installation and cause problems (more on this in a moment), once again leading you to rebuild.  This is a case where when Microsoft says, ""We don't support you doing that,"" they mean it.

The good news is, if you want to have your own server at home and you want it to be hassle-free, Windows Home Server will fit your needs.  99% of the tasks you perform are all in one place:  the Windows Home Server Console.  This rich graphical interface drives everything you'll do in managing and configuring your server.  It simplifies tasks and provides quick at-a-glance information on your server's status.

So what are some of those features?

Backup and mirroring:  Windows Home Server will enable you to back up your home computers to it.  These backups update themselves on a schedule that you set and can later be used to restore the machine if things go wrong.  Instead of using RAID for disk redundancy, Windows Home Server uses a technology called ""folder duplication.""  It seems bizarre to omit RAID from a server that's supposed to keep redundant copies, but here in Windows Home Server, it really is better suited to the OS' design.  It is also closely customizeable, allowing you to specifically set which folders should be duplicated for data protection.

Disk management:  it's easy to add or remove extra drives.  WHS uses drive letter mapping to make all volumes the ""D:\"" drive.  This drive letter is a logical mapping off the root physical volume, and your C:\ drive is deliberately limited to a much smaller volume in order to make restoring the server a snap on those hopefully-rare occasions when you have to.  Storage is balanced across volumes automatically and while watching it happen on my MediaSmart Ex495 I rarely see it impact performance.

Media sharing and streaming:  Using simple ""Music, Photos, Videos"" categories, you can control how to share media and also enable or disable streaming.  You can also enable/disable integration with Windows Media Center. Windows Media Center on your PCs will easily pick up on the existence of the server and walk you through installation of the plug-in once you have enabled this feature.  I found WMC integration to really be dirt-simple to set up and useful to have on all my machines, and I'm betting it integrates really well with an X-Box 360 as well.  I've used it with my Playstation 3 and it's been very easy to access through the PS3's Media Bar (or ""XMB"").  There are also the Firefly Server (which I have not used closely) and TwonkyMedia, which provides an alternative way of managing and streaming your content.  Last, there is iTunes functionality but I have not used this feature (there are many, MANY forums that can help you with this if you'd like to learn more).

The hard part of Windows Home Server is recognizing that it is best used on its own terms:  use the Windows Home Server Console to access the server and its settings, use the Windows Home Server Toolkit to do deeper ""expert"" tasks (and try to avoid doing these unless you have to), and most importantly do not remote into the box.  Windows Home Server carefully manages the installation and configuration of software, and accessing these programs from outside the console can cause problems.  More importantly, Microsoft's Windows Update pushes updates based on the machine's server core.  Windows Home Server uses Server 2003 as its core.  In plain English this means that Windows Home Server appears to Microsoft Update as if it's a Server 2003 box.  When the Console controls the updates, it is capable of filtering out the Server 2003 updates that are intended for WHS and those that aren't.  Remoting into the box will cause Windows Update to call and answer with the full list and add updates to the queue that WHS really shouldn't have.  Which is to say nothing of the default behavior of Remote Desktop Connection, which is to assume you want to share resources (such as printers, faxes, scanners on the network) with your remote session and try to install the drivers on the server while you're connected.

If you want a simple home media server, Windows Home Server will provide an easy-to-use, easy-to-manage, self-maintaining way to do it.  However, you have to work within its rules and you need to be willing to let go of the lower-level things a typical Server administrator will do.  If you want a robust and configurable server machine that allows you to customize to your heart's content, you may not be happy with the loss of control WHS requires.  You might consider just installing your own server and being done with it.",4
"Back when I did my 2005 taxes, I swore I would never go back to TaxCut.  I had a harrowing experience with the program including software bugs and crashes, inadequate interface, missing schedules, and a nightmare with deduction pro.  To top it all off customer support was virtually non-existant.  When I did get through they were unable to help me.

When I received a free copy of TaxCut 2008 Premium Federal in the mail with 'Free! We want you back"" blazoned on the CD jacket, I was leary but then thought, 'what the heck. It's free, I'll try it.'

PROS:
1. Competent tax programt that has come a long way--now comparable with
TurboTax (in the past this was not the case)
2. Reasonable interface
3. Reasonably priced
4. Federal forms worked smoothly
5. INCREDIBLE customer support via webchat; BETTER than TurboTax
6. Much improved DeductionPro
7. Easy e-file

CONS:
1. I think TurboTax still has the edge...
2 Poor integration with state forms
3. So-so interview for state forms
4. Poor help files for state forms
5. DeductionPro not as easy to use for non-monetary donations/deductions as TurboTax's It'sDeductable
6. Key codes needed for e-filing weren't included in my version.  They were easy to obtain from customer support, but this was an unnecessary annoyance.

So try it, I did and I was pleasantly surprised. I am comparing this to last year's experience with TurboTax, as I was satisfied with TaxCut and went with it.  On the whole, the Federal tax experience is excellent, however, the state tax experience was less smooth.  (See below)

Bear in mind that I do not have an overly difficult return to file.  No major investments and not very complicated itemized deductions.  I did move this year so I had two state forms to fill out and did sell and buy a house.  Other than this, pretty simple and standard.  I completed the taxes on an iMac, so this may be somewhat different than the Windows version.

THE INTERFACE:  For starters, my TurboTax information from last year imported with out a hitch.  The questions were simple and to the point. There are fewer fill-ins per screen than in last year's TaxCut.  My guess is that it took a little longer than last year, but that may have had to do with the increased complexity of my taxes.  One caveat here is that you have to answer the questions carefully, as missing one will result in missing one part of your tax.  In comparison with TurboTax, TaxCut's interview questions are a little less clear.  Double checking and knowing your finances does solve most problems, but care must be taken to make sure you don't miss a schedule or a life event.  On the whole this was easy, but I'd give a slight edge to TurboTax here.

On the whole, the feature sets are similar between programs.  I would have to say, that TurboTax is somewhat slicker.  TurboTax allows you to download some W-2s electronically--I did not see that option in TaxCut.  TurboTax has better integration between help files and the interview and also allows for easier navigation between sections on the tax forms.  But TaxCut is no slouch and was adequate to the task.

DEDUCTION PRO:  This is gobs better than TaxCut 2005.  I like the fact that the program is installed on your computer, making it more responsive than the TurboTax equivalent.  (It'sDeductable!, from TurboTax, is an online program.)  It was easy to input various charities and non-monetary donations.  DeductionPro has a 'calculator' for non-monetary donations, but once you calculate the value you have to manually input it into DeductionPro.  The TurboTax version allows you to calculate the value and then directly inputs it into the spreadsheet--a much smoother operation.  Unlike my past experience with DeductionPro, the deductions were quickly and easily imported into TaxCut.  If you revise your deductions and reimport the file, TaxCut now has a failsafe to prevent you from deducting the same things twice.  Much better than 2005.  If you have a lot of non-monetary deductions, TurboTax would win the competition.  If you have mostly monetary deductions, TaxCut's interface is better and, given that the program runs on your computer, there is no need for passwords and no time lags that can happen on web-based programs.

FINAL AUDIT:  Both programs seem to have reasonable audit features and bring you to the area of the forms where there are questions or problems.  No difference here.

E-FILING: There are 5 free e-files on TaxCut and the process went without a hitch.  Both programs work well in this respect

CUSTOMER SUPPORT/PROBLEMS:  I had to contact customer support 3 times with TaxCut.  Each time, I used their webchat interface.  My longest wait for an customer service rep was 10 minutes.  Each time, the customer service rep was courteous, helpful, and solved my problem.  This is MUCH MUCH BETTER than what occurred in 2005 when customer service was virtually non-existant and unable to help.

Problems included:
1. The need for a Key Code in order to e-file.  Key codes were not included with my program (unclear why).  I needed a keycode for both the federal form and the state forms.  These were supplied by the customer service rep.
2. Inability to remove an inappropriate schedule from a state form.  I was walked through this with a service rep
3. The CD I received did not have DeductionPro bundled with it.  Customer service gave me a download link for the program.  (This may be a glitch in the Apple/OSX version of the program)

Each time help came quickly and easily.  TaxCut gets 5 stars for live 24 hour help.  Last year's TurboTax help was okay, but nothing to write home about...

STATE FORMS:  This is where TaxCut takes a bit of a dive.  Based on my experience with the Federal forms, I bought and downloaded the state forms.  All I needed were the key codes (as noted above) which were absent after the download.  These weren't sent via email, but I knew about this when I requested the codes for the federal forms and received the key codes for the state at the same time.

The state forms are less well integrated with the federal forms than I remember from TurboTax.  I never had to complete two forms with TurboTax.  Suffice it to say, the NJ form was easier than the PA form (which is strange because PA is a flat percentage of your income).  The state forms did not integrate with each other at all.

The PA and NJ forms did import information from the federal forms and W-2s, but did not take the information about my move from the beginning of the TaxCut interview.  I had to input this information into the state forms and actually had to do this separately for each state as the state forms do not integrate with each other.  The same was true for salary collected from one state while my primary residence was in the other.  I had to input redundant information into the program.  It's hard for me to compare this with TurboTax as I had only used TurboTax with a single state before.

The state forms did not have thorough interviews.  Some information had to be typed directly into the forms themselves.  Not specifically a problem, but in the tax software business, the interface is the most important thing.

Finally, the state help files were not as thorough.  Especially for PA, I found myself downloading files from the PA state site in order to review instructions for filling out the tax forms--a major glitch in the TurboTax state forms.

One major problem:  the PA form imported the sale of my home from the federal taxes.  The problem is, sale of a primary residence is not taxable in PA unless some part of the home is used for commercial purposes (or a few other exceptions).  After researching the instructions and downloading PDFs of the PA forms from PA state, I realized that this was the case.  Needless to say, TaxCut calculated a massive underpayment and I was unable to delete scheudule D without consulting customer service.  (As it turns out, I had to delete the schedule D 'worksheet' and then delete the forms.  If you try to delete the forms themselves, nothing happens...)

SUMMARY:  On the whole, I was pleasantly surprised with TaxCut.  Would I use it again?  I suppose I would.  TaxCut was a bit more rough around the edges to use than TurboTax, but beat TurboTax hands down with their customer support.  I would say that these programs are both good ways to do taxes.

On the whole, however, I was pleasantly surprised by TaxCut this year.  Would I have used it if I hadn't received the federal form free? Probably not.  But I will have to think about whether I will stick with TaxCut next year and the program was good enough to get me thinking.",4
"I struggled for months figuring out the best way to write a review for this program and, admittedly, spent too much time testing it out as 2010 versions of security software are already starting to hit the shelves.  After testing a number of antivirus and internet security programs over the course of 2009, I would like to call this the best of them all as there are many features I absolutely love.  However there are also some serious design flaws in this program that make it almost unusable.

I will get right down to the most serious issue.  This program absolutely cannot be used in Automatic Program Control (APC) mode.  APC mode is the ""set it and forget it"" mode that is enabled by default and allows Norton to work behind the scenes to allow ""good"" programs and block ""bad"" programs from accessing the Internet.  Most people like this because they're not bugged with all the annoying messages about whether to allow a program or not.  Unfortunately, when I ran a series of firewall breach tests (thanks Matousec!) with APC enabled, Norton 360 failed in every single one(!)  This means if you mistakenly download a trojan or backdoor, if it is not detected via the antivirus database Norton WILL allow it Internet access.  In my experience, if APC mode is enabled, 360 will allow Internet access automatically to any program we execute ourselves.  Fortunately I can say that with APC mode turned OFF, Norton 360 was able to detect and alert me to every potential firewall leak and give me the option to block it.

To help users disable APC, I uploaded an image to show you where this setting is enabled.  To do this yourself, open the Norton 360 main menu by doubleclicking the Norton icon in the system tray, click ""Settings"" at the menu at the top, then click ""Firewall"" (2nd option from the left), then click the tab at the top right that says ""Advanced Settings"".  From there, turn Advanced Program Control OFF and make sure Advanced Events Monitoring is ON.  Unfortunately this will mean that you will receive the occasional message when you execute an unknown program or a program tries to access the Internet for the first time.  It will give you information like the filename and the directory the file is located so you can determine whether the file is safe.  Once you select Allow Always, it won't bug you again.  In other words, it may seem annoying at first, but eventually you won't even notice it and it's much safer than leaving APC enabled.

That major gripe aside, this really is the best version of security software Symantec has ever made.  Following the trend of ""just enough to get the job done"" computing that the explosion of netbooks has taught the computer industry, Norton 360 is stripped down and optimized in order to have a negligible effect on computer resources, even on my aging computer.  Installation was unbelievably fast.  It really is the fastest and most trouble free version of antivirus software that I have ever used.  Most of the menus are intuitive and settings are easy to find.  Scans and backups are automatic and behind the scenes.  Most things happen while the computer is idle and you won't get the annoying menus in your face while it's updating which always used to disrupt our work in the past.  Amazingly, customer service has improved too!

Let's start with customer service.  Finally, we get something besides a FAQ to look at.  When we open support it will automatically install flash player if we need it, then scan our computer for potential problems.  If that doesn't work we can open a chat session and the person on the other end has the ability to fix things from their end if we allow them to (they'll ask first).  I did run into one problem, they'll assign ticket number for us to enter if a reboot is necessary.  When I accessed the Symantec website in order to enter the ticket number and reconnect I was unable to do so.  A serious issue that happened to me twice.  They say they are working on the problem. We'll see.  Talking to a human is an available option but still a fee service.  Regardless, this level of service is much improved versus others that send you to a FAQ or force you to wait days for a return email.

Backups work well and you are allowed to select whatever you want along with system files if desired. Backup can be done to either the Internet (2MB max, more costs extra) or other hard drives, including external devices.  The only problem I run into is it seems to backup items almost every single time I let my computer idle or when I'm watching a DVD.  It would be nice if idle function could be set for a little longer than just half an hour.  Backups to CD/DVD are available but you will need to do this manually.  Now for the bad news, in spite of constant complaining by Norton Users, Norton 360 still will not do a complete clone of your system to another drive.  If your hard drive crashes, your backed up files will be safe as long as they were saved elsewhere.  As far as restoring Windows, prepare to suffer the joys of Windows reinstallation.  If you want a real backup system (hard drive cloning), I would recommend Casper by Future System Solutions.  I like the way backup works, but until Norton is able to restore our operating system as well as files I will always knock off a star.

One nice feature about websurfing is Norton examines websites on the fly and will warn you if you are entering personal information in a website deemed unsafe.  When you Google Search, you will now see green checkmarks next to all sites deemed safe along with grey for unsure or red for unsafe.  In addition Norton 360 has ""Identity Cards"" you can set up that are similar to a popular program named Roboform.  By using the identity cards, you can enter repetitious personal information like your name and address and so on into webforms automatically whenever you wish.  A paranoid person like me does get a little concerned about entering personal information into Norton but I've learned to trust the encryption and it's a wonderful time saver.  Again, none of these features seem to slow down websurfing at all.  My only gripe is that the two icons representing Norton's services have to take up an entire toolbar and they won't allow anything else to be added to the large blank line that takes up precious space.  What gives?

With APC mode disabled, the antivirus scans work as they should.  I have caught a few false positives which is problematic because it quarantines them automatically.  I have yet to find an option for it to do otherwise, even though I have the ""remove viruses automatically"" setting turned OFF.  It's also a giant clickfest in order to find out what files Norton actually removed.  After a scan (or whenever you return to your computer and start working), a popup will appear that tells you x number of files contained viruses, but then you have to click, click, click through a giant database that logs every action taken by Norton in order to find the exact filenames.  Once you find the files, there is an option to submit them to Symantec for review but the false positives don't seem to be resolved quickly.  The so-called Security History Database is a real mess and could use some optimization of its own.

Now... all this said, it probably sounds like I hate this program but the truth is it's the most aggravation free program I have ever used.  Those gripes I have mentioned have been the only ones I have come across after months and months of use.  Aside from the APC problem, the program runs like a dream.  When you start an antivirus scan and realize that you don't even notice a reduction in performance, you'll know what I mean.  The pulse updates are truly awesome and everything that is supposed to work just works as it should.  You are notified of pretty much everything that you should know about.  Gripes aside, I still think Norton 360 is the best security software of 2009.

Edit 11/4/09:  Found some of the notes I misplaced.
* It's time Norton starts supporting the popular email programs for antispam that are not MS Outlook.
* I miss watching all the blocks being moved around during a defrag.  It was strangely hypnotizing.
* Each monthly report shows 'x' intrusions were blocked but there are no details in the database.
* The backup process works fine but setup is really slow and laggy.
* A nice feature is Delayed Startup to make your bootup times faster.  The problem is the delayed programs start about 5 min later whether you're working or not.  Some programs may steal focus.  The feature could be improved if Norton waited until there was no activity on the computer before executing.",4
"Here comes Windows 7, nearly three years after Windows Vista and eight years after Windows XP.  By most accounts, Windows 7 is what Vista should have been.  Do we finally have a worthy successor to XP?

PROS:
- Fast startup and performance
- Stable
- Nice aesthetic and functional changes to the desktop
- Improved networking, power management & security
- 32-bit & 64-bit versions included
- Windows Media Center
- Windows XP Mode (Professional & Ultimate only)

CONS:
- User Account Control still annoying
- Upgrade can be challenging
- Expensive

There are only two Microsoft operating systems I've personally skipped since DOS 6.x-- Windows ME and Windows Vista.  Windows ME was so terrible that PC World coined it the ""Mistake Edition.""  Vista, when initially released, was considered to be bloated, relying on higher hardware requirements than XP, while being outperformed by XP on identical hardware.  With Microsoft fast-tracking Windows 7, I decided to skip Vista altogether and upgrade to 7.  This review briefly touches upon some of the key features and enhancements of Microsoft's latest OS.

PERFORMANCE & STABILITY
One of the welcome enhancements Microsoft made was start-up time.  The shutdown time has been improved as well.  Also, in my non-benchmarked experience, Windows 7 has been at least as fast as XP if not faster.  The kernel changes and ability to run the 64-bit version probably has a lot to do with that.  Most benchmarks from around the Internet seem to support my observations.

64-BIT
I am elated to finally upgrade to a 64-bit operating system in order to take advantage of more memory support and modern processors.  I have Intel Core 2 Duo processors in both my systems with 4GB of physical RAM but XP only allowed 3.25GB for system use.

DESKTOP
At first login, you'll notice the changes to the taskbar.  The taskbar is no longer just a place to store quick launch icons and view open windows.  It now provides functionality in the form of Jump Lists, which allow you to select your most frequently opened files or links from the apps you have ""pinned"" on the taskbar.  The clock and calendar are improved and the Show Desktop icon is now integrated in the far right corner.  Other desktop enhancements include Aero Peek, Aero Shake, Snap, new themes and wallpapers.  You also get gadget support.  All of these features combine to create a much improved and enjoyable desktop experience.

LIBRARIES
Windows 7 introduces a new feature called libraries.  Previously, your system had shortcuts to My Documents, My Music, My Pictures, etc. which had files residing in only those specific folders.  Files can now reside anywhere on your system and be organized inside libraries.  It's similar to how many music and photo applications organize files.

NETWORKING
Even as good as XP was, networking was cumbersome.  Windows 7 makes connecting two or more Windows 7 systems together easy, using HomeGroup.  This enables easy sharing of files and devices.  One downside is that HomeGroup is only supported between Windows 7 systems.  File transfer performance between computers has been vastly improved and connecting to a wireless network has never been easier on a Windows machine.

SECURITY
Security in Windows 7 is good and comes with Windows Firewall and Defender. Still, you'll probably want to invest in a more comprehensive Internet security suite, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton-Internet-Security-2010/dp/B002L7BR20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton Internet Security 2010</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kaspersky-Internet-Security/dp/B002I0HJRM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kaspersky Internet Security</a>. User Account Control (UAC) has been tweaked in order to give user accounts more flexibility in controlling their own security as well as providing more detailed information so the user can make better decisions about whether to allow certain actions. Coming from XP however, it is still annoying and I choose to turn it off. Also, in Windows 7 Ultimate, you can encrypt entire hard drives as well as external portable storage devices, like USB thumb drives. Though this is a welcome integrated feature, much of the functionality can be found in a popular open-source program called TrueCrypt. If you want encryption but not multi-language support, you could just get Windows 7 Home Premium and use TrueCrypt.

POWER MANAGEMENT
Power management has been improved overall and you should be able to squeeze more battery life out of your laptop, even when using your DVD drive.  Sleep and resume has also been improved.  XP wasn't always consistent when entering or resuming from sleep mode, but Windows 7 has been perfect.

WINDOWS MEDIA CENTER
I've only briefly played around with WMC but it looks promising.  It has some fun options for media, especially when you're connected to the Internet.  It may even be an adequate replacement for component DVR's should you choose to use it as the centerpiece to your entertainment center.  The biggest advantage for me is that Windows 7 now includes a DVD decoder.  This means that I can now watch DVD's natively.  WMC is available in all Windows 7 editions except Starter.

WINDOWS XP MODE
For applications that ran in XP, but won't on 7, there is now XP Mode.  It isn't perfect and your system has to have virtualization support and turned on.  Go to your system BIOS to check.  If supported, then install Windows Virtual PC and Windows XP Mode.  Check your hardware if you intend to use XP Mode.  XP Mode is only available in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Windows-7-Professional/dp/B002DHLVII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Windows 7 Professional</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Windows-7-Ultimate/dp/B002DHGMVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Windows 7 Ultimate</a>&nbsp;editions.

RECOMMENDATIONS
If you're an XP holdout, like I was, I recommend upgrading. Vista SP2 users may have less reason to upgrade but might want to just for the changes to the taskbar and the UAC improvements. For users who don't need to use their computers in a corporate environment, then Windows 7 Home Premium edition is a good choice. I'm guessing most power users will choose Professional, which adds XP Mode and Domain Join. Ultimate also adds drive encryption and multi-language support. I suggest a clean install for best results. If you're a Mac OS X user, there is probably nothing in Windows 7 compelling enough for you to consider switching.

SUMMARY
Windows 7 is the premium Microsoft OS that Windows users have been waiting for.  It's fast, secure, stable, visually appealing and fun to use.  Windows 7 will make your old system feel fresh and new again.  New system owners with Windows 7 pre-loaded can feel confident that they're getting the best Windows OS ever produced.",4

** CLEAN UPGRADE UPDATE BELOW 10/29/09 **

PROS:

CLEAN UPGRADE UPDATE 10/29/09 **
It seems that a lot of upgraders have been complaining about the upgrade process, especially from XP. Most of us expected to be able to format our hard disks and be prompted for either the XP disc or product key. Alas, this is not the case. The upgrade is much more complicated than it should be and some workarounds have been discovered

Method A (simplest)
If you already have an older version of Windows on the hard drive, finish the Custom Install, without entering the product key. After installation, go to your System Properties and click the link to activate Windows. Enter your product key and it should activate. This has worked for me twice.

Method B (hardest)
If Method A doesn't work, try the registry hack.
1. Finish the custom install without entering the product key then click Start and type regedit.exe into the ""Search programs and files"" box.
2. In the registry, navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Setup/OOBE/. In the pane on the right, you'll see an entry for MediaBootInstall. Double-click on it and change the value from ""1"" to ""0"" and click OK.
3. Close regedit and go to Start -> All Programs -> Accessories then right-click on Command Prompt and select ""Run as administrator."" You'll get a UAC alert, click Yes.
4. At the command prompt, type: slmgr /rearm and hit Enter. Reboot.
5. Now try to activate. If it fails, make sure there are no pending Windows Updates to install. If there is, install them, reboot and start over from Step 4.

Method C (most time consuming)
Perform the Custom Install and skip the product key. Once completed, run the upgrade again from within Windows 7 but this time, enter the Windows 7 upgrade key and then activate Windows.
** END UPDATE **

I had been running the Windows 7 release candidate for 3 months and the full version 2 weeks before official release date. The experience convinced me to finally upgrade my Windows XP systems to 7. This review briefly touches upon some of the key features and enhancements of Microsoft's latest OS.

"This is the full version of Windows 7, so chances are you're looking at it because you are building a new computer and plan on putting this on it.  If you're wanting to upgrade your old XP or Vista computer and start from scratch, it's not like the old days where you could only format by using a full version.  Save yourself some money and purchase the upgrade version:  it will still offer you the ability to do a ""clean"" install and jettison the old Windows baggage.

I HIGHLY recommend you stop by Microsoft's website and look the different versions over to confirm you have the right one.  If you're running a computer old enough that you're upgrading from Windows 98 or Windows 2000, I don't recommend it:  your performance will drop and you'll see compatibility problems, some of which may be major.  If this is the case, stop by the Microsoft site, grab their ""Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor"", and run it first.

That said, Windows 7 Home Premium is probably the best bet for the average home user.  Unlike XP Home, which made basic things like networking a pain, or Vista Home, which really seemed to only be missing some eye candy, 7 Home Premium truly is aimed at the everyday consumer.  What you are missing when you pass on the Pro and Ultimate versions of 7 are:

Pro gives you:
1) complex networking made simpler (for example, connecting to AD domains and/or interacting with your workplace/corporate networks)
2) ""XP Mode"" - which runs a program within a virtual version of XP.  All versions of Windows 7 still have the ability to use ""XP Compatibility Mode"", which fools your programs into thinking they're running in XP, but the ""XP Mode"" feature of 7 Pro and Ultimate is an honest-to-god XP shell that runs within Windows 7.  Your hardware will also need to support ""Virtualization Technology"" in order to take advantage of this, otherwise this feature won't work.
3) Automated backup (which can be done using free tools if you'd rather save the money).

Ultimate also adds:
4) ""BitLocker"" Hardware-level encryption (your hardware will need to have a ""Trusted Platform Module (TPM)"" to support this or it won't work)
5) Native multi-language support:  which means you switch from one language to another on the fly and need to make things easier on yourself than they were when you used the Language Bar in XP or Vista

If you're a typical home user, chances are you'll be perfectly happy with Windows 7 Home Premium.  If you're an avid gamer who often has to rig that favorite game *just so* in order to get it to run, you might consider Windows 7 Pro to ease your headaches.  Ditto if for some reason you have a lot of older ""barely XP compatible"" programs that you think might be completely unable to function in just ""XP Compatibility Mode""--again, this is where the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor, downloadable from Microsoft, can help you out (more on this in a moment).  You might also consider checking user forums for the program to see if anyone else has an answer.

I'm running Windows 7 Home on what was a risky upgrade: a Dell Inspiron 8200 that I've hacked to the Dell Precision D50 BIOS (to get an nVidia Quadro4 500 GoGL to work).  I realize that's a mouthful, and it did take some tinkering to get it upgraded properly. Between this machine's 7 Home Premium, and the Pro and Ultimate versions I have on other machines, I've been very happy with Home Premium:  thus far my XP programs run smoothly without having to fiddle with them, and I think I've actually picked up a bit of a performance gain from it.

If you're putting this on a new computer that you want to use to replace an older computer, you will be happy to know that you can migrate all your old stuff from one machine to another.  Search Microsoft for ""Windows Easy Transfer"":  this program will let you migrate just the user accounts and settings to the new machine very simply.  If you want to take it a step further--for example, you have a lot of programs on the old machine you don't want to have to sit down and reinstall one by one on the new machine--you can migrate all of them for $19.95 using Laplink PC Mover:  Amazon and the Laplink website are currently offering a special version that is just designed to migrate one computer to Windows 7 one time.  Read the documentation very carefully and keep a copy of it handy as I've no room to go into detail on that here.

So what are some of the things Microsoft doesn't tell you in the description above?

Windows 7 isn't just ""fixed Vista"":  it's a full overhaul of Windows based on a ton of feedback collected directly from Beta and RC 1 users (of which I was one--I let them have an earful and I think they actually listened)

Windows 7 does things drastically different from XP in that, like Vista, it does a lot of the eye candy in a smoother way.  XP and earlier used to send graphics work through your processor before it'd get to your video card...now, it bypasses the processor and goes straight to the video, clearing up what was a pretty substantial bottleneck.  This system was imperfect (to say the least!) in Vista, but it's been improved here, particularly in the area of being compatible with older games

Windows 7 is trying to slowly ""trim the fat"" we normally have to put up with by making itself more compatible with other devices.  Where you typically have to install a new device by running the manufacturer's setup disc, installing a bunch of junk and tray icons, and etc., Microsoft is making native support more common in 7.  My sound card, for example, used to need about 5 or 6 ""helper"" programs that would drain my performance and occasionally annoy me.  Now it's just using the drivers that came with the installation of 7.

Now, if you *are* upgrading, here are some very important things you need to know:

1) There are two types of upgrade: ""in-place"" (where a Vista machine upgrades to 7 and you get to keep all your programs) and ""clean"" (where you lose all your old programs and settings).
2) Anyone going from XP to 7 will have to go ""clean"".
3) Anyone going from a different Vista to 7 (for example, Vista Home up to 7 Pro, or Vista Ultimate down to 7 Home) will also have to go ""clean"".

If you have to do 2) or 3), all is not lost--I'll explain in a moment.

Before you even buy a 7 upgrade for your machine, stop by Microsoft's website for two things:

a) download and run the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor, as mentioned above. Run it with every device connected to the machine that you'll ever want to use in 7. It'll thoroughly examine your machine for any roadblocks and give you good advice about upgrading. Even very new machines will have one or two programs that need some checking.
b) Go to the Windows 7 Compatibility Center and double-check anything that came up negative in the Upgrade Advisor (or didn't show up at all). This site lists detailed compatibility info on a LOT of different devices and even lets you select between 32-bit and 64-bit.

Anything critical to the operation of the machine, like a video card or sound card driver, I'd recommend double-checking with the manufacturer's website to be sure. This almost burned me on the Dell I mentioned above--the video driver was approved in the Upgrade Advisor but failed the Compatibility Center check.  Going to the manufacturer's website let me get my hands on a driver that I could apply after the install.

c) Last, make a backup on another hard drive. There's a free tool called Macrium Reflect that can do this for you.

Do you have to do a ""clean"" install, but just want to carry over your user accounts and settings? Microsoft's Windows Easy Transfer (also mentioned above) is already insatlled on a Vista machine (and XP users can download it from Microsoft). Easy Transfer will export your accounts and settings and let you import them back again. It's very easy to use and does a good job of putting your accounts back together again, even going from XP to 7.

Do you have to do the ""clean"" install, and you don't want to reinstall all your programs? Use the Laplink PC Mover Windows 7 Upgrade Edition to upgrade.  Each purchase of this special edition will do one machine one time. Read the documentation in detail:  the steps are rahter easy, but they're also rather important to get right the first time.

The most important thing to doing a ""clean"" install and keeping your programs and settings is that in the Upgrade setup you choose ""Custom"". Windows will take all of your major files and place them in a folder called ""Windows.old"". PC Mover and the Easy Transfer program will use this folder to reconstruct your system from, so this is VERY important.

New Operating Systems are always a bumpy road:  your journey might not be as easy as others.  However, compared to previous Windows releases, Windows 7 is a substantial improvement, and I'm pleased to say that I haven't been burned by 7 like I was with Vista (and Windows Me--agh, the horror, the horror).  If you just want to get yourself onto the 7 platform and don't need a lot of customization, Windows 7 Home is a great place to start.",4
"If you've had the chance to see Apple's newest attack add against Windows in which the nerdy PC guy goes back through time talking about how the most recent version of Windows will fix all the problems from the last, you might be asking yourself if it really is worth upgrading to Windows 7. Aside from the fact that the add is grossly unfair (considering Apple released quite a few OS during the same years as Windows, and none of them were perfect either), the add has a point: some Windows versions have been inferior or even downright terrible (ME for example). That said, Windows 7 is a great OS, really a dramatic improvement in many ways, and should not be ignored. The short answer is you should absolutely upgrade from either XP or Vista. The longer answer is still a yes, but that you need to understand what you're buying and how you can use it first.

I think much of the confusion about this version of Windows 7 surrounds the title 'upgrade.' Many have taken 'upgrade' to mean that one can seamlessly move from XP or Vista without having to reinstall anything. This is not always the case depending on what OS you are upgrading from. Here 'upgrade' means that you are 'upgrading' from one OS to another. The retail versions are being sold for systems that have no OS in place at all--for example a new system build. I agree that Microsoft (and Amazon for that matter) could and should have been explicit about this--unfortunately they were not, and that's left a sour taste in the mouths of many, which I totally understand. Adding to the confusion is that you can seamlessly upgrade from Vista Professional with this version, but NOT Visa Home Premium, NOR Vista Ultimate. Microsoft did not do a good job of making the seamless upgrade paths clear, so here they are:

If you are upgrading from XP (any version) you MUST do a clean install of Windows 7. No seamless upgrade route is available. However, you CAN do a dual boot installation that will allow you to keep XP and run it in tandem with Windows 7. This is a great route if you have programs that may not run on Windows 7 (I've yet to find one myself--everything I have runs perfectly).
If you have XP, you should do a clean install. Even if it is time consuming, it bears a multitude of benefits for you and your computer in the long run. If you're dead set on upgrading from XP and keeping your programs, you could try&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Laplink-Windows-7-Upgrade-Assistant/dp/B002TOL9S2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Laplink Windows 7 Upgrade Assistant</a>&nbsp;but I would NOT recommend it.

If you are upgrading from Vista, here is what you need for a seamless upgraded:

Vista Home Premium:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Windows-7-Home-Premium-Upgrade/dp/B002DHLUWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade</a>

Vista Professional:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Windows-7-Professional-Upgrade/dp/B002DHGM50/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Windows 7 Professional Upgrade</a>

Vista Ultimate:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Windows-7-Ultimate-Upgrade/dp/B002DHLV8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade</a>

Keep in mind that you MUST install the same system type (32-bit or 64-bit) as your current version of Vista to have a seamless upgrade route available! You cannot upgrade from a 32-bit to a 64-bit system and keep your programs (well actually you can keep some of them, but more on that later). Since you are provided both 32-bit and 64-bit installation disks, you can choose which version you want to run. If you have newer hardware, 64-bit is probably the way to go as it is faster and will allow you to take advantage of more than 3.5gb of system RAM.

The silliest part of the upgrade scheme is that you CANNOT do a downgrade 'upgrade.' In other words, you cannot downgrade from Visa Ultimate to Windows 7 Professional through the seamless route! This defies logic and explanation from Microsoft, and is the reason I've knocked a star off an otherwise nearly perfect OS.

Personally I did a clean install of Windows 7 64-bit over a Vista 64-bit system (I chose the clean install method because I believe it represents the best route to a trouble free and 'clean' feeling system). I installed over my old Windows directory (which I had backed up by creating a disk image using Acronis True Image Home just in case anything went wrong. Installation took about 30 minutes, actually much faster than any other OS install I've ever done. All of my hardware was recognized and drivers were installed without a hitch. The old windows files are moved to a windows.old file which contains all of your user accounts, program files, and old Windows files. It is possible to open the programs file (in windows.old) and copy over many programs into your new programs file and some of them will work perfectly fine. I was able to do with with all my web browsers, a few computer games, and some random applications. Not EVERYTHING will work, but many will and it's worth at least testing it out.

I've since upgraded several other computers (my wife's laptop, a few computers at work). My wife's was a simple streamline upgrade from vista home to Windows 7 home (32-bit to 32-bit). It took a bit longer, probably about an hour, but managed to keep all programs and settings from Vista. The others were clean install upgrades. The only one that I had an issue with was upgrading a 32-bit system to a 64-bit system. I installed to a different hard drive and booted up to W7 just fine. However, I could not delete the old windows files from the previous installation. I followed various Googled help pages on taking ownership of files, etc., but was unable to get all the files to delete no matter what I did. Ultimately I was forced to physically remove the hard drive, put it into an enclosure, and delete the files using a separate computer. The UAC (User Account Control) system that prevents system files from being deleted was in this case out of control and impossible to overcome--even for an middle-advanced computer user who knows how to troubleshoot/problem solve using online resources. For someone with less experience, it would have been even more frustrating I am sure.

Many others have gone into great detail about the feature set of Windows 7 and the various improvements from Vista, so I will not spend much time running through all of them again. Suffice it to say that Aero works wonderfully, QuickSnap is amazing, especially on a larger monitor, and that all of the visual tweaks are nicely done and very welcome. The reorganization of the start menu is wonderful and makes the W7 task bar nearly perfect. Add a simple dock program to the mix like RocketDock (google it) and this OS is hands down better than even Snow Leopard--which is pretty awesome.

Performance is also great. My boot time went from 1:47 to :56! Nearly a minute faster! (Hardware: E8500, P45 Asus Striker MB, 8GB ram, Hd4870 x2 in crossfire). Overall the OS just 'feels' faster, snappier, and easier to use. Everything Vista wasn't, W7 is.

I'm very pleased with W7, and aside from some miserable communication from Microsoft about what upgrade means and what can upgrade to what, it's nearly flawless. If you want a stable, fast, visually appealing and advances OS, W7 will not disappoint. Just make sure you know what you're buying so that you don't end up dissatisfied.

4/5 Stars.",4
"Three month update:
(1) I'm changing this rating of this from three to four stars (after solving my biggest lingering issue; this was principally an eSATA hardware issue, not a Windows 7 issue, but which available support offerings did little to help resolve).

(2) I finally isolated the recurring --but intermittent-- shutdown, non-responsive task manager and disappearing external hard drive issues that plagued this install of Windows 7. They were directly related to known issues with the eSATA interface of this Western Digital My Book Home 500 GB USB 2.0/FireWire 400/eSATA Desktop External Hard Drive WDH1CS5000N. Online research reveals an extended history of users experiencing a wide variety of performance issues with that hard drive's eSATA interface. In my case, when I switched from eSATA to USB 2, my Windows 7 immediately became stable and trouble free.

My other experiences in the upgrade from Vista to Windows 7 lead me to recommend this: don't wade into this upgrade unless you have confidence in your operating system troubleshooting kung fu. You'll probably need your best tricks should you have an obscure issue. But get through it...and Windows 7 is as good as any Windows operating system I've used (going back to Windows 3.1).

End of update. Original review content follows:

--------------------------------------

...just don't expect annoyance-free operation. It may be Windows 7, but it's first name remains ""Windows"". My experience: the benefits marginally outweigh the issues. But Windows 7 is not issue-free; don't consider unless you're a confident Windows troubleshooter.

Technology pundits wrote at length about Windows 7 in assessing the pre-release offering. Opinions abound, offered by both sycophantic Windows 7 fanboys and the zealous Windows haters (who seem to never tire of reminding Windows users that they are oh-so-cool with their overpriced Mac hardware or exotic distributions of Linux).

Market share alone tells the rest of the story: most of us --for whatever reasons-- are in a long term relationship with Windows operating systems at both home and work. If we're lucky, somebody else carries the upgrade decision and headaches of execution at work. As for home: even if we're in the market for a new computer (or just tired of Vista's quirks on an existing machine) and not yet ready to re-stock your entire applications catalog to go with Mac or Linux: then we're going to be dancing with Microsoft for a while.

What follows are the highs and lows of one user's experience.

This review focuses on the upgrade process, which began the day after the regular release. I'm still exploring some of the interface features.

Caution: mild geek-speak appears below:

This upgrade was for an 18-month old Dell XPS 420 desktop machine (similar, but not identical to the linked one. The machine receiving the upgrade holds a dual-core Intel E6850 CPU (3 GHZ), 4GB of RAM, two 500 GB (non-RAID) internal hard drives, an ATI Radeon HD 2600 XT graphics card with ethernet and audio integrated into the motherboard).

A long-term problem on this machine has been a conflict between Vista and the graphics adapter preventing me from *ever* successfully updating the graphics drivers; some of the attempted work-arounds have been very painful...and all unsuccessful. This was my primary reason for choosing to go from Vista to 7 (and to be fair, this problem is as much ATI's fault as Vista's; ATI user forums provide abundant discussion showing I was not alone in this situation).

Preparations for the upgrade took about an our to complete. My data files are regularly archived to an external hard drive, so this wasn't a big deal. If you're not as diligent about regular backups, you'll probably need more time.

My upgrade path (Vista Home Premium to 7 Professional) required the ""custom"" install approach, requiring a full reinstall install of your applications and data which won't make the trip from Vista to 7 (in truth it's only the installed applications that are sure goners; if had a senior moment and really forgot to backup valuable data, it may still be available in a folder named ""windows.old"" after the upgrade --but don't count on it; do your backups beforehand). I would have selected this choice even if the direct upgrade had been available; direct upgrades of Windows, with the seeming benefit of preserving your current applications and data are notorious for being buggy afterward.

I also went online to check for Windows 7-specific drivers for a scanner and two printers (a monochrome laser and an color inkjet) that are hooked to this machine. Two of these devices already had Windows 7 drivers available; the web site of the other promised ""November"" availability (and the Vista drivers worked perfectly well for the one still waiting for its Windows 7 update).

Once my data was backed up, the new drivers saved and I had collected the applications I would need to reinstall (some were on CD, some were downloaded executables) I started the journey from Vista to Windows 7.

Timeline (from loading the install DVD):
-5 minutes: notification that ""upgrade"" option (retaining files and applications) was not available and that the ""custom"" option was required.
-18 minutes: blue screen of death following long Vista shutdown sequence; not sure if this was normal or not.
-20 minutes: ""starting Windows"".
-29 minutes: installation ""completed""; first automatic restart.
-32 minutes: installation ""completed""; second automatic restart, and visual progress bar appears at bottom of screen.
-75 minutes: installation *really* complete, and initial Windows setup options offered.

Windows 7 immediately recognized my wireless mouse and keyboard; the printers and scanner drivers were installed the devices available within 45 minutes.

As a veteran of several earlier operating system upgrades, installs on new machines, or reloads on older machines, this was by far the easiest (to this point). No drastic solutions were needed that had occurred following other Windows OS upgrades due to disconnects between Microsoft and hardware vendors (including a very scary BIOS upgrade during an Windows ME to XP upgrade, and the required purchase of a new printer to replace one that simply wasn't supported by Vista).

Immediate improvements:
-The Start menu has been simplified (get this: selecting the Start | Shutdown sequence actually *SHUTS DOWN* the computer now, instead of launching a THIRD window (and you can speed this up further with readily available desktop gadgets that take you direct to shutdown)
-The programs listing is far easier to manage and customize, and the taskbar navigation is greatly improved. The taskbar permits greater control over its contents (and even if it can't keep an application for loading there, you can control which ones you see!).
-User access control is much less problematic than in Vista (the only warnings I've received is when trying to run executables).
-Folder navigation is far more intuitive, and I no longer feel like I'm managing my operating system at the same time I'm managing my tasks.

Immediately after installation, this Windows 7 machine shut down in 20 seconds. Start up now takes about 55 seconds from the BIOS/POST sequence to the first appearance of the OS splash screen, and the menu of users is available about 90 seconds after powering on. The user desktop is ready to work (mine is fairly cluttered, with a dozen or so shortcuts and six separate desktop gadgets) about 10 seconds after the user selection is made.

But it's not all sunny and mild with Windows 7:
Microsoft has presented us with far too many upgrade paths, and even a powerful machine will be constrained somewhat by the operating system if you try too much multitasking. Also, see below for a discussion of Adobe products and their compatibility with Windows 7.

2-week update:
More flaws emerge:

After three days, I developed shutdown hang. Went through Microsoft's chat support offering...but should have used the phone (as multiple restarts were required, adding additional time to re-establish chat with the same agent...and the technician surely should have suggested this). We spent about 90 minutes checking services via msconfig. I disagree with their suggestion to begin by assuming that all Microsoft services are not potential suspects for this, and that it's a non-MS service causing the hang. Bottom line after this is the problem has improved from being constant (when it first appeared) to intermittent.

When I finally upgraded the video card driver (the primary reason for making the move), the shutdown problem became less intermittent...but still present.

Since then, I've changed the power management setting from ""balanced"" to ""performance"" (not an issue with a desktop on AC power) and updated both the CPU chipset drivers and BIOS. These steps have collectively reduced --but has not eliminated-- shutdown issues. The chipset and BIOS tweaks are not things most users are going to want to mess around with (and the BIOS update always carries the risk of turning your motherboard into a paperweight should the power go out while its underway).
Other issues:
(1) sometimes the task manager won't launch
(2) sometimes the task manger won't end frozen processes
(3) sometimes it won't access data in an attached external hard drive (eSATA interface)...even though the drive itself is still recognized. This always clears up upon restart.
Presumably these are known to MS and will be corrected in an update or the first service pack.
(4) If you are running older versions of Adobe products (in my case, Acrobat 8, Photoshop Elements 6 and Premier Elements 4): you may have compatibility issues with these versions that Adobe does not ""officially"" support in Windows 7. While I place this issue firmly in Adobe's court, if you are using Adobe applications, do your homework. Adobe products are generally intrusive (in terms of both activation requirements and footprint within the tender areas of a PC operating system) and definitely not cheap. I think I've resolved this, but it wasn't free of trouble, cost or time to do so.

Please note that I experienced NONE of these things under Vista.

Finally:
If you are buying a new laptop or desktop with Windows 7 already installed:
you'll probably be a happy camper until you run into your first case of ""we don't support Windows 7"" (yet...or at all) with your version/model of software/hardware.",4
"Here comes Windows 7, nearly three years after Windows Vista and eight years after Windows XP.  By most accounts, Windows 7 is what Vista should have been.  Do we finally have a worthy successor to XP?

** CLEAN UPGRADE UPDATE BELOW 10/29/09 **

PRO's:
- Fast startup and performance
- Stable
- Nice aesthetic and functional changes to the desktop
- Improved networking, power management & security
- 32-bit & 64-bit versions included
- Windows Media Center
- Windows XP Mode (Professional & Ultimate only)

CON's:
- User Account Control still annoying
- Upgrade can be challenging
- Expensive

** CLEAN UPGRADE UPDATE 10/29/09 **
It seems that a lot of upgraders have been complaining about the upgrade process, especially from XP. Most of us expected to be able to format our hard disks and be prompted for either the XP disc or product key. Alas, this is not the case. The upgrade is much more complicated than it should be and some workarounds have been discovered

Method A (simplest)
If you already have an older version of Windows on the hard drive, finish the Custom Install,  without entering the product key.  After installation, go to your System Properties and click the link to activate Windows.  Enter your product key and it should activate.  This has worked for me twice.

Method B (hardest)
If Method A doesn't work, try the registry hack.
1. Finish the custom install without entering the product key then click Start and type regedit.exe into the ""Search programs and files"" box.
2. In the registry, navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Setup/OOBE/.  In the pane on the right, you'll see an entry for MediaBootInstall.  Double-click on it and change the value from ""1"" to ""0"" and click OK.
3. Close regedit and go to Start -> All Programs -> Accessories then right-click on Command Prompt and select ""Run as administrator.""  You'll get a UAC alert, click Yes.
4. At the command prompt, type: slmgr /rearm and hit Enter.  Reboot.
5. Now try to activate.  If it fails, make sure there are no pending Windows Updates to install.  If there is, install them, reboot and start over from Step 4.

Method C (most time consuming)
Perform the Custom Install and skip the product key. Once completed, run the upgrade again from within Windows 7 but this time, enter the Windows 7 upgrade key and then activate Windows.
** END UPDATE **

I had been running the Windows 7 release candidate for 3 months and the full version 2 weeks before official release date.  The experience convinced me to finally upgrade my Windows XP systems to 7.  This review briefly touches upon some of the key features and enhancements of Microsoft's latest OS.

PERFORMANCE & STABILITY
One of the welcome enhancements Microsoft made was start-up time.  The shutdown time has been improved as well.  Also, in my non-benchmarked experience, Windows 7 has been at least as fast as XP if not faster.  The kernel changes and ability to run the 64-bit version probably has a lot to do with that.  Most benchmarks from around the Internet seem to support my observations.

64-BIT
I am elated to finally upgrade to a 64-bit operating system in order to take advantage of more memory support and modern processors.  I have Intel Core 2 Duo processors in both my systems with 4GB of physical RAM but XP only allowed 3.25GB for system use.

DESKTOP
At first login, you'll notice the changes to the taskbar.  The taskbar is no longer just a place to store quick launch icons and view open windows.  It now provides functionality in the form of Jump Lists, which allow you to select your most frequently opened files or links from the apps you have ""pinned"" on the taskbar.  The clock and calendar are improved and the Show Desktop icon is now integrated in the far right corner.  Other desktop enhancements include Aero Peek, Aero Shake, Snap, new themes and wallpapers.  You also get gadget support.  All of these features combine to create a much improved and enjoyable desktop experience.

LIBRARIES
Windows 7 introduces a new feature called libraries.  Previously, your system had shortcuts to My Documents, My Music, My Pictures, etc. which had files residing in only those specific folders.  Files can now reside anywhere on your system and be organized inside libraries.  It's similar to how many music and photo applications organize files.

NETWORKING
Even as good as XP was, networking was cumbersome.  Windows 7 makes connecting two or more Windows 7 systems together easy, using HomeGroup.  This enables easy sharing of files and devices.  One downside is that HomeGroup is only supported between Windows 7 systems.  File transfer performance between computers has been vastly improved and connecting to a wireless network has never been easier on a Windows machine.

SECURITY
Security in Windows 7 is good and comes with Windows Firewall and Defender.  Still, you'll probably want to invest in a more comprehensive Internet security suite, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton/dp/B002L7BR20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton</a>.  User Account Control (UAC) has been tweaked in order to give user accounts more flexibility in controlling their own security as well as providing more detailed information so the user can make better decisions about whether to allow certain actions.  Coming from XP however, it is still annoying.  Also, in Windows 7 Ultimate, you can encrypt entire hard drives as well as external portable storage devices, like USB thumb drives.  Though this is a welcome integrated feature, much of the functionality can be found in a popular open-source program called TrueCrypt.

POWER MANAGEMENT
Power management has been improved overall and you should be able to squeeze more battery life out of your laptop, even when using your DVD drive.  Sleep and resume has also been improved.  XP wasn't always consistent when entering or resuming from sleep mode, but Windows 7 has been perfect.

WINDOWS MEDIA CENTER
I've only briefly played around with WMC but it looks promising.  It has some fun options for media, especially when you're connected to the Internet.  It may even be an adequate replacement for component DVR's should you choose to use it as the centerpiece to your entertainment center.  The biggest advantage for me is that Windows 7 now includes a DVD decoder.  This means that I can now watch DVD's natively.  WMC is available in all Windows 7 editions except Starter.

WINDOWS XP MODE
For applications that ran in XP, but won't on 7, there is now XP Mode.  It isn't perfect and your system has to have virtualization support and turned on.  Go to your system BIOS to check.  If supported, then install Windows Virtual PC and Windows XP Mode. Check your hardware if you intend to use XP Mode.  XP Mode is available in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Windows-7-Professional/dp/B002DHGM50/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Windows 7 Professional</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Windows-7-Ultimate/dp/B002DHLV8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Windows 7 Ultimate</a>&nbsp;editions.

RECOMMENDATION
If you're an XP holdout, like I was, I recommend upgrading.  Vista SP2 users may have less reason to upgrade but might want to just for the changes to the taskbar and the UAC improvements.  For users who don't need to use their computers in a corporate environment, then Windows 7 Home Premium edition is a good choice.  If you decide on Windows 7 Home Premium and need to upgrade more than one PC, I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Windows-7-Home-Premium-Upgrade-Family-Pack/dp/B002MV2MG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade Family Pack</a>, which is an excellent deal.  I'm guessing most power users will choose Professional.  I suggest a clean install for best results.  If you're a Mac OS X user, there is probably nothing in Windows 7 compelling enough for you to consider switching.

SUMMARY
Windows 7 is the premium Microsoft OS that Windows users have been waiting for.  It's fast, secure, stable, visually appealing and fun to use.  Windows 7 will make your old system feel fresh and new again.  New system owners with Windows 7 pre-loaded can feel confident that they're getting the best Windows OS ever produced.",4
"This is the full version of Windows 7 Professional, so chances are you're looking at it because you are building a new computer and plan on putting this on it.  If you're wanting to upgrade your old XP or Vista computer and start from scratch, it's not like the old days where you could only format by using a full version.  Save yourself some money and purchase the upgrade version:  it will still offer you the ability to do a ""clean"" install and jettison the old Windows baggage.

I HIGHLY recommend you stop by Microsoft's website and look the different versions over to confirm you have the right one.  If you're running a computer old enough that you're upgrading from Windows 98 or Windows 2000, I don't recommend it:  your performance will drop and you'll see compatibility problems, some of which may be major.  If this is the case, stop by Microsoft.com, grab their ""Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor"", and run it first.

That said, Windows 7 Home Premium is probably the best bet for the average home user.  Unlike XP Home, which made basic things like networking a pain, or Vista Home, which really seemed to only be missing some eye candy, 7 Home Premium truly is aimed at the everyday consumer.  Professional is going to be more suited to a corporate environment, or if you are an individual, you will probably want Professional for a personal machine that you regularly use to interact with a workplace.

Pro gives you:
1) complex networking made simpler (for example, connecting to AD domains and/or interacting with your workplace/corporate networks)
2) ""XP Mode"" - which runs a program within a virtual version of XP.  You still have the ability to use ""XP Compatibility Mode"", which fools your programs into thinking they're running in XP, but the XP Mode is an honest-to-god XP shell that runs within Windows 7.  Your hardware will need to support ""Virtualization Technology"" in order to take advantage of this.
3) Automated backup (which can be done using free tools such as Macrium Reflect if you'd rather save the money)

Ultimate also adds:
4) Hardware-level encryption (and your hardware will need to support this)
5) Native multi-language support:  which means you switch from one language to another on the fly and need to make things easier on yourself than they were when you used the Language Bar in XP or Vista

If you're a typical home user, chances are you'll be perfectly happy with Windows 7 Home Premium.  If you're an avid gamer who often has to rig that favorite game *just so* in order to get it to run, you might consider Windows 7 Pro to ease your headaches.  Ditto if for some reason you have a lot of older ""barely XP compatible"" programs that you think might be completely unable to function in just ""XP Compatibility Mode"" (check user forums first).  And of course, if you have a desktop or laptop that you often use to connect to work with, check with your support guru, and he'll tell you whether you need to go with the Pro.

Probably one of the biggest advantages with Windows 7 over earlier versions of Windows is that it makes sorting out your networks easier:  specifying whether a network is a Home, Work, or Public network means Windows will be more open about sharing across your machines at Home, easier to access your files at Work, but much more cautious about information when you're on a Public network (which means, free Wi-Fi hotspots and the like).  This will help you a lot if you're jumping from a home environment to a work environment on a regular basis.  It also helps Windows decide how often to nag you about security:  more when you're connected to a Public network, less if you're at Home or securely connected to Work. If you dealt with that in Vista, you'll be relieved at the fewer security nags in 7.

Another huge improvement is ""Windows XP Mode"".  If you have a program that is picky, XP Mode will run it in a native XP virtual environment.  This doesn't have to mean the user has to know how to manage Virtual Machines; it can be configured to be localized to the program:  stop by CNET TV, and look at the video ""Windows 7 video:  Windows XP Mode"" for an excellent explanation and demo).

If you're putting this on a new computer that you want to use to replace an older computer, you will be happy to know that you can migrate all your old stuff from one machine to another.  Search Microsoft.com for ""Windows Easy Transfer"":  this program will let you migrate your old user accounts and settings to the new machine very simply.  If you want to take it a step further--for example, you have a lot of programs on the old machine you don't want to have to sit down and reinstall one by one on the new machine--you can migrate all of them for $19.95 using Laplink PC Mover:  their website is currently offering a special version that is just designed to migrate one computer to Windows 7 one time.  Read the documentation very carefully and keep a copy of it handy as I've no room to go into detail on that here.

So what are some of the things Microsoft doesn't tell you in the description above?

Windows 7 isn't just ""fixed Vista"":  it's a full overhaul of Windows based on a ton of feedback collected directly from Beta and RC 1 users (of which I was one--I let 'em have an earful and I think they actually listened)

Windows 7 does things drastically different from XP in that, like Vista, it does a lot of the eye candy in a smoother way.  XP and earlier used to send graphics work through your processor before it'd get to your video card...now, it bypasses the processor and goes straight to the video, clearing up what was a pretty substantial bottleneck.  This system was imperfect (to say the least!) in Vista, but it's been improved here, particularly in the area of being compatible with older games

Windows 7 is trying to slowly ""trim the fat"" we normally have to put up with by making itself more compatible with other devices.  Where you typically have to install a new device by running the manufacturer's setup disc, installing a bunch of junk and tray icons, and etc., Microsoft is making native support more common.  My sound card, for example, used to need about 5 or 6 ""helper"" programs that would drain my performance and occasionally annoy me.  Now it's just using the drivers that came with the installation of 7.

New Operating Systems are always a bumpy road:  your journey might not be as easy as others.  However, compared to previous Windows releases, Windows 7 is a substantial improvement, and I'm pleased to say that I haven't been burned by 7 like I was with Vista (and Windows Me--agh, the horror, the horror).  If you just want to get yourself onto the 7 platform and don't need a lot of customization, Windows 7 Home is a great place to start.  If you need more for your work environment (or you are building a workplace environment), then 7 Pro is the way to go.",4
"If you've had the chance to see Apple's newest attack add against Windows in which the nerdy PC guy goes back through time talking about how the most recent version of Windows will fix all the problems from the last, you might be asking yourself if it really is worth upgrading to Windows 7. Aside from the fact that the add is grossly unfair (considering Apple released quite a few OS during the same years as Windows, and none of them were perfect either), the add has a point: some Windows versions have been inferior or even downright terrible (ME for example). That said, Windows 7 is a great OS, really a dramatic improvement in many ways, and should not be ignored. The short answer is you should absolutely upgrade from either XP or Vista. The longer answer is still a yes, but that you need to understand what you're buying and how you can use it first.

I think much of the confusion about this version of Windows 7 surrounds the title 'upgrade.' Many have taken 'upgrade' to mean that one can seamlessly move from XP or Vista without having to reinstall anything. This is not always the case depending on what OS you are upgrading from. Here 'upgrade' means that you are 'upgrading' from one OS to another. The retail versions are being sold for systems that have no OS in place at all--for example a new system build. I agree that Microsoft (and Amazon for that matter) could and should have been explicit about this--unfortunately they were not, and that's left a sour taste in the mouths of many, which I totally understand. Adding to the confusion is that you can seamlessly upgrade from Vista Home Premium with this version, but NOT Visa Professional, NOR Vista Ultimate. Microsoft did not do a good job of making the seamless upgrade paths clear, so here they are:

If you are upgrading from XP (any version) you MUST do a clean install of Windows 7. No seamless upgrade route is available. However, you CAN do a dual boot installation that will allow you to keep XP and run it in tandem with Windows 7. This is a great route if you have programs that may not run on Windows 7 (I've yet to find one myself--everything I have runs perfectly).
If you have XP, you should do a clean install. Even if it is time consuming, it bears a multitude of benefits for you and your computer in the long run. If you're dead set on upgrading from XP and keeping your programs, you could try&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Laplink-Windows-7-Upgrade-Assistant/dp/B002TOL9S2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Laplink Windows 7 Upgrade Assistant</a>&nbsp;but I would NOT recommend it.

If you are upgrading from Vista, here is what you need for a seamless upgraded:

Vista Home Premium:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Windows-7-Home-Premium-Upgrade/dp/B002DHLUWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade</a>

Vista Professional:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Windows-7-Professional-Upgrade/dp/B002DHGM50/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Windows 7 Professional Upgrade</a>

Vista Ultimate:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Windows-7-Ultimate-Upgrade/dp/B002DHLV8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade</a>

Keep in mind that you MUST install the same system type (32-bit or 64-bit) as your current version of Vista to have a seamless upgrade route available! You cannot upgrade from a 32-bit to a 64-bit system and keep your programs (well actually you can keep some of them, but more on that later). Since you are provided both 32-bit and 64-bit installation disks, you can choose which version you want to run. If you have newer hardware, 64-bit is probably the way to go as it is faster and will allow you to take advantage of more than 3.5gb of system RAM.

The silliest part of the upgrade scheme is that you CANNOT do a downgrade 'upgrade.' In other words, you cannot downgrade from Visa Ultimate to Windows 7 Professional through the seamless route! This defies logic and explanation from Microsoft, and is the reason I've knocked a star off an otherwise nearly perfect OS.

Personally I did a clean install of Windows 7 64-bit over a Vista 64-bit system (I chose the clean install method because I believe it represents the best route to a trouble free and 'clean' feeling system). I installed over my old Windows directory (which I had backed up by creating a disk image using&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Acronis-True-Image-Home/dp/B001DSGXFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Acronis True Image Home</a>&nbsp;just in case anything went wrong. Installation took about 30 minutes, actually much faster than any other OS install I've ever done. All of my hardware was recognized and drivers were installed without a hitch. The old windows files are moved to a windows.old file which contains all of your user accounts, program files, and old Windows files. It is possible to open the programs file (in windows.old) and copy over many programs into your new programs file and some of them will work perfectly fine. I was able to do with with all my web browsers, a few computer games, and some random applications. Not EVERYTHING will work, but many will and it's worth at least testing it out.

I've since upgraded several other computers (my wife's laptop, a few computers at work). My wife's was a simple streamline upgrade from vista home to Windows 7 home (32-bit to 32-bit). It took a bit longer, probably about an hour, but managed to keep all programs and settings from Vista. The others were clean install upgrades. The only one that I had an issue with was upgrading a 32-bit system to a 64-bit system. I installed to a different hard drive and booted up to W7 just fine. However, I could not delete the old windows files from the previous installation. I followed various Googled help pages on taking ownership of files, etc., but was unable to get all the files to delete no matter what I did. Ultimately I was forced to physically remove the hard drive, put it into an enclosure, and delete the files using a separate computer. The UAC (User Account Control) system that prevents system files from being deleted was in this case out of control and impossible to overcome--even for an middle-advanced computer user who knows how to troubleshoot/problem solve using online resources. For someone with less experience, it would have been even more frustrating I am sure.

Many others have gone into great detail about the feature set of Windows 7 and the various improvements from Vista, so I will not spend much time running through all of them again. Suffice it to say that Aero works wonderfully, QuickSnap is amazing, especially on a larger monitor, and that all of the visual tweaks are nicely done and very welcome. The reorganization of the start menu is wonderful and makes the W7 task bar nearly perfect. Add a simple dock program to the mix like RocketDock (google it) and this OS is hands down better than even Snow Leopard--which is pretty awesome.

Performance is also great. My boot time went from 1:47 to :56! Nearly a minute faster! (Hardware: E8500, P45 Asus Striker MB, 8GB ram, Hd4870 x2 in crossfire). Overall the OS just 'feels' faster, snappier, and easier to use. Everything Vista wasn't, W7 is.

I'm very pleased with W7, and aside from some miserable communication from Microsoft about what upgrade means and what can upgrade to what, it's nearly flawless. If you want a stable, fast, visually appealing and advances OS, W7 will not disappoint. Just make sure you know what you're buying so that you don't end up dissatisfied.

"The progress in speech recognition over the years has been mind boggling. 1995 was when I first started using IBM Via Voice and you had to speak each word distinctly. Original Dragon product was called Dragon Dictate and then they changed it to Dragon Naturally Speaking in 1997 and I have been using it ever since, faithfully upgrading to each new version. At that time when you called technical support you could even talk to Dr. Janet Baker, the inventor of the speech recognition and founder of Dragon.

With version 4 they started Dragon Naturally Speaking Medical and that helped in that medical terminology was already included albeit several folds the cost of the regular professional Dragon Naturally Speaking.

Each version has improved the accuracy and they have not made the product unduly complicated or cluttered, as is the usual tendency with software upgrades. Version 11 of Dragon is slower and needs more resources, I could not run it in Windows 7 under Fusion and have to use it in Windows 7 under Bootcamp on Mac. The speech recognition accuracy is almost 97% in this version: it still stumbles on small words like two, to, too, 2; of, off; and, on; for, per etc. But upgrading from Dragon version 10, the improvement is accuracy is noticeable enough to make this upgrade worthwhile. Although program gives you the option of adding punctuation automatically, in my experience it does not work well and you are better off dictating punctuation. Tutorial videos that come with the program and on their Nuance web site are very helpful. In the past it really helped that you could print the commands and pin the sheet on the wall so you could reference them while dictating: not in this version, they do not give you the option of printing commands. But at least it was a pleasant surprise to see that Nuance has not ruined Dragon 11 like their other product Paperport 12.

Sitting in front of your computer screen you say ""Search Hardware Compatibility on Nuance""  - and out pop the results of your search in front of your eyes. The program will open your browser, search Google and bring the results on Nuance web site on your screen. For sure, you will be wowed!

Since it is going to be a while before the Dragon medical comes out, I decided to buy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-Naturally-Speaking-Premium-11-Bluetooth/dp/B003VNCRPY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium 11 Bluetooth</a>&nbsp;which comes with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PLANTRONIC-Calisto-Headset-with-USB-Dongle-81493-02/dp/B0031XZ9TU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PLANTRONIC Calisto Headset with USB Dongle - 81493-02</a>. For general dictation the accuracy is fantastic. By letting the program scan my previous documents, I have been able to add a lot of medical terminology and save money by finding no need to purchase medical version when it comes out.

Previously they did not allow the option of using different accents in Dragon Medical but in this basic premium version you can and that has also helped improve the accuracy of speech recognition. So by selecting the Indian accent and adding medical vocabulary manually by scanning my documents, I have not only improved the accuracy but also saved money.

I purchased&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-Naturally-Speaking-Premium-11-Bluetooth/dp/B003VNCRPY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium 11 Bluetooth</a>&nbsp;and the Calisto headset that came with it works really well.

Nuance's marketing department is very lazy and they use the same cookie cutter boilerplate text for all the different Dragon Naturally Speaking product lines without differentiating them but if you search ""Feature Matrix"" on their web site you can find the differences in different lines. The very basic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-Naturally-Speaking-Home-11/dp/B003VNCRNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon Naturally Speaking Home 11</a>&nbsp;cannot be used with a recorder, has limited correction playback ability, and does not share vocabulary with different audio input sources. Then they also describe Dragon Naturally ""Professional"" version which does not show up on Amazon, as of September 2010, but has the ability to record macros and programming VBA scripts. Most users will need&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-Naturally-Speaking-Premium-11/dp/B003VNCROU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium 11</a>. The premium version has text expanding commands, for example you can add a command to insert your full address when you say ""home address"". I still cannot figure out whether&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-Naturally-Speaking-Premium-11-Student-Edition/dp/B003VNCRR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium 11 Student Edition</a>&nbsp;has any less features or just a cheaper version of Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium 11. Looks like anyone can order it and you do not have to be a student. Nuance does not even give you the specifics of Digital Voice Recorder and Bluetooth versions in the product descriptions. What sluggard's?

The technical support from Nuance stinks - almost non-existent. If you run into any technical problems, you are much better off searching it on Google and using the expertise of other users in different forums. Don't expect any technical support from Nuance. Even their web site is disorganized and cluttered. They have all the information available on their web site, but just not obvious. Sometimes you have to search Google to find information on Nuance web site. Thankfully they appear to have some wiser voices in Dragon product development which are keeping their eye on the ball and have prevented Nuance from messing up the speech recognition accuracy and user interface of Dragon, so far. Another annoying thing they have started in this version is the pop up ads from software updater hounding you to buy their program Paperport 12.

For getting speech into the software, you have lot of different options that include corded and cordless headsets and microphones and recorders including PDA's. The whole list of voice capturing products is on Nuance's web site under ""Hardware Compatibility""  and they rate each one of them for voice recognition accuracy by number of Dragon's.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sony-ICD-MX20DR9-32MB-Flash-Based-Digital-Voice-Recorder/dp/B000N29LAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sony ICD-MX20DR9 32MB Flash-Based Digital Voice Recorder</a>&nbsp;has the highest number of six Dragons. But following are what they sell and recommend and have good voice recognition fidelity:

A). Calisto Pro Bluetooth headset which comes with Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium 11 Bluetooth. But you can also buy it separately. In my experience it has the best speech recognition fidelity of all the microphones I have used, including Andrea. Purchasing Calisto Bluetooth as a part of Dragon 11 Bluetooth is a lot better deal that buying the two separately.

B). Philips SpeechMike - SpeechMike Air 3010 which is a wireless microphone but more expensive or Philips SpeechMike Pro Plus 5276 USB which has a cord. Advantage is the programmable buttons. I used it in QuickBooks Pro 2009  because the buttons could be customized for commands like next field, tab, correct, delete line, etc. But voice recognition accuracy is not as good as Calisto.

C). Dictaphone PowerMic II Nuance-Dictaphone that works with Dragon and they sold it previously only with their Medical and Legal versions. SpeechMike and Dictaphone recorders give you the ability to pause, play, fast forward and customize buttons for different commands. SpeechMike (and Dictaphone) are useful if you are going to use speech recognition in programs other than word processing or plain documents.

D). Voice recorders like Sony ICD-MX20, Philips Digital Tracer and numerous others which you can find by searching ""Hardware Compatibility"" on Nuance web site.

In last 10 years I have mostly dictated on recorders and then done the corrections at the end of the day in Dragon software. Real time correction can be time consuming and interrupt the flow of work; depending upon your line of work and accent too. Until now, I used SpeechMike 5276 for Dragon speech recognition in specialized software like Quickbooks, Quicken etc. mainly because it has programmable buttons - for example you can program a button to insert Ctrl-Delete  at the same time. But now that Bluetooth headset is available, I have been using it with keyboard. At this time I am not sure if Philips SpeechMike makes you more efficient and productive than Bluetooth headset but it certainly is lot more expensive. Now that speech accuracy has improved, and the corrections do not take as much time, I have been dictating real time instead of using a recorder.

Irrespective of those dictation modalities,  if you need to write a lot in your work e.g. journalist, lawyers, doctors, students, or for other projects, then you will not go wrong with this product. It will save you a lot of keyboard input and time.",4
"Bottom-Line:  From online banking/bill paying, to investment and retirement tracking, ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" is (still) the program for me.

I have been a devoted Intuit ""Quicken"" user since the DOS days of the program way back in the early `80's.  I have strayed a few times--once with Microsoft Money, and another time with a program whose name now escapes me, it was so long ago.  In the end I have always come back to ""Quicken,"" a program I consider the best personal financial program on the market.  I like ""Quicken"" because it allows me to seamlessly track all of my checking and savings accounts, (almost all) investments, and home inventory in one modular, easy to use package.  And I use Quicken to bank on-line, an added convenience that has made check-writing, bill paying, and account reconciliation so much easier.

The last time I upgraded Quicken was in at the end of 2009; that is when I updated to Quicken Premiere 2009.  I did so because Quicken 2005 was becoming buggy, and rather than re-install the program I decide to upgrade.  Also, I never like to be more then two versions behind, and; finally I hoped there would finally be an easy way to track U.S. Saving Bonds within the program; better luck next upgrade.  And oh, yes, one last reason: I got the software fro free through work.

I decide to go with ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" this time around because employees of the company I work for are allowed to download the software from Intuit for free, and because my version was becoming dated.

Installation

If you have a previous version of Quicken on your computer, the installation process will remove it completely, so be forewarned; i.e. back up your Quicken data to a separate directory before you start the install process.  There is a caveat however, one can use keyboard shortcut keys to install the new version along-side the old version and operate both at the same time.  I do not keep my Quicken data in the same directory as the program files, so this was not a concern for me.  And I always back up my Quicken data after each session.

At the end of the install, the program prompts you to upgrade the just installed software, and if you have internet access, I recommend you do so.  After the upgrade I started ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" for the first time, at which point I had the option to either start a new file or convert an existing one; I choose the later.  My Quicken 2009 data file was converted seamlessly by ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" without the slightest bit of trouble, for which I will be eternally grateful.

First Impressions:

As I stated at the outset of this review, I track all of my finances through Quicken; i.e. checking, savings, 401(K), investments, Saving Bonds (I have to improvise, there is no way to directly track Bonds in Quicken), loans, etc., as well as a household inventory via the Quicken Home Inventory module included in the program.  Some of my accounts are electronic and this feature still works well under ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" although one of my major bank accounts still cannot download transactions automatically.

One of the first things you'll notice is the new desktop home page.  The lines have been softened, and there is a new logical flow that is easy on the eyes.  My accounts are laid out on the left hand pane divided into account types.  The account can be re-arranged to suit you individual tastes.  But really there is not much difference between this and the previous version of the software.

Intuit brings back the Projected Cash Flow under the ""Spending"" tab at the top of the screen underneath the menu bar.  Quicken uses this area to give you a snapshot of money coming in verse money going out, by automatically tracking deposits from all accounts and bills.  I pay little attention to the area; it is nice to look at but I find its use limited.  Below this area there are a further three tabs entitled Scheduled Bills & Deposits, Account Balance Graph, and Spending Graph.  Again I see very little practical use for any of the areas, but they can be customized.

Other tabs across the top of the screen include: Bills, Planning, Investing and Property & Debt.  Again, I found little useful information underneath these tabs, but they are colorful and if you have a 401(k) the Investment tab might find some use.

With ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" you can set-up several account types, which the program divides up into four categories: Spending which encompasses the following account types: Checking Accounts, Savings Accounts, Credit Cards, and Cash; Investments: Brokerage, IRA or Keogh Plan, 401(k) or 403(b), and 529 Plan; Property: House, Vehicle, and Other Assets, and; Debt: Loan and Other Liability (not a credit card).

Each account can be associated with a bank or banking institution and the usually account information added; e.g. account number, opening balance, bank website, interest rates, etc.

One-Step Update

Almost everything I do in Quicken involves the On-line Center (replaced by One-step Update in Quicken Premiere 2011).  Via the One-Step Update I can gain access to most of my banking and investment accounts from which I can download transactions in one step.  Once the accounts are set up, the account information is saved to the Pin Vault and thereafter I can download my most recent transaction into my account registers.  Once downloaded the transactions can either be accepted all at once or one by one.  This beats keeping a written register!

Conclusion

Is there a compelling reason to upgrade to ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" from previous versions of the software?  Not really, unless you need the specific functionality the software brings to the table.  There have been slight improvements to the interface and a few new features associated with business use, but overall the program is unchanged.  The minor changes hardly justify the steep upgrade price of $64.99 (Amazon.com price).

And where is my support for bonds, bonds, bonds?  Surely I am not the only one who buys and tracks bonds.  Bond, be they U.S. Treasury Department Saving Bonds, Treasury Bills, Municipal Savings Bonds, or Corporate Bonds, as an important part of any diversified investment portfolio.  Get it together Intuit!

Despite the continued lack of support for Bonds, ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" is still the way to go if you want to simplify your (personal) financial life without a lot of fuss.  From online banking/bill paying, to investment and retirement tracking, to a robust home inventory database, ""Quicken 2011 Premiere"" is (still) the program for me.",4
"The sheer amount of functionality packed into a typical office suite is already more than would fit in a typical review here so you'll excuse me if I don't go over every detail for you here. Feel free to search the Web or PC World/CNet/etc. for a full and thorough review of everything under the hood here. Also, note that I'm upgrading from 2003 to 2010 (i.e. I'm skipping the 2007 stepping stone) so my experience is colored by the broader difference in versions.

That said, I've got to say even knowing this is the ""pro"" version that means it basically has just about everything you could want in the Office stable, there's a lot of software packed into this package. I'm coming from Office 2003 Pro so while the amount of software isn't overwhelming for me, someone who's upgrading from a ""home"" edition or another office suite that might have fewer items.

If you're not new to Office, skip to the next section below (see UPGRADING?). For those of you who are coming from another office suite (or even platform like MacOS/iWork), you're getting a lot of software here that covers just about every base, assuming you're comfortable with Microsoft's take on things. You get Word (word processing, obviously), Excel (spreadsheets), PowerPoint (presentations), Publisher (page layout/design), Outlook (e-mail client), One Note (document/media organizer), Access (non-Enterprise database solution).

I can't really compare apples to apples here since there are a handful of office suites out there (iWork, OpenOffice, etc.). Suffice it to say, you've got all the basics (word processing, spreadsheets, presentations) along with some helpful bonuses (mail, page layout/design, document organization and collaboration). Each app does what it's supposed to do and does it pretty well. They've had more than 10 years to get it right and in large part they have. Obviously, coming from a different environment (or those using an office suite for the first time) will mean a lot of options you have no idea how to use.

However, in general, especially with the new menu system Microsoft cooked up, everything you need is close at hand. This also includes the right-click menu. For example, I live by the Paste Special option on the right-click menu in Excel. When you're manipulating data, especially financials, you're transposing and copying data from referenced cells where you need just the values and their formats copied. Paste Special is your friend. Now, with the new menu structure, instead of a click to pop-up a list of options, you'll get a side menu that shows up as soon as you hover over Paste Special and all the options are there. You'd be surprised how much time you save NOT having to find the one option you use every time and click OK in a dialog. Basically you're saving one out of two clicks added up over days, weeks, and months.

Meanwhile, each app has a literal boatload of specific functions for the application at hand. Working on a presentation? Don't worry, you've got enough image manipulation functions and tools on hand that you really don't need to leave the app to get the image resized, brightened and cropped. It's all there. Like I said, Microsoft--as much as they get derided for sub-optimal software and feature bloat...by yours truly as well as others--managed to leverage years of experience and feedback into a set of apps that does just about everything you could possibly need from an office productivity suite and makes sure you don't need to leave (unless you've got something really specialized that needs its own app).

Do you need to buy this? As much as the cost is high and it's a big investment, I can't imagine why not. You get more apps than most of the office suites out there and they all work well together. The main Microsoft apps (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint) are globally recognized so you rarely have to deal with the ""Can you open this file?"" question. And, given the ""baby step"" that is the 2007 to 2010 upgrade, you're almost guaranteed to not need another office suite package or upgrade for at least 3 years if not longer. I mentioned that this is a ""big investment"". In a sense it really is an investment. And, outside of the whole Vista thing, Microsoft didn't screw up this release. So, if you've got the funds, definitely add this to your cart and get it installed as soon as you can. You'll be finding features you didn't know existed and that you'd needed for months.

UPGRADING?
If you're upgrading from a previous or ""cheaper"" version of Office, there isn't a whole lot to say. I mean, you can only do SO much with productivity software. Sure there are little nuances and small features that are geared towards saving you time but--for example--you can only do font size and weight selection so many ways.

Do you really need this package? I'd say yes but for only two scenarios: 1) you're upgrading from a Home or Student version because you need one of the additional apps in this package, and 2) you're still using some very old version of Office (Office 6 anyone?) and need to catch up with the 21st century.

For the former group, you're here because you need Publisher, Access, or Outlook. What more can I say? Click Add to Cart and get going.

For the latter crowd, unless you're already on 2003 or 2007, you should definitely upgrade. It's about time. If you're still using 2007, I can't imagine why you'd want to upgrade. There isn't THAT much that's new if anything. I had to look up the differences between 2007 and 2010 to even figure out what's so special...and it's not a lot (upgraded menus, additional security options, some better tie-ins to Web collaboration). I'd just wait for 2013 or whatever the next version is...it might read your mind by then so...that's an upgrade that might be worth saving up for.

If you're using 2003, there's obviously a marked change (I'm reluctant to call it an improvement but you could see it that way) related to the UI and the way the menus are handled. As  I touch upon above in the ""full"" review, it's actually not bad. They've basically taken the menu bar and the tool bars, shaken them up and put out a collection of tabs with buttons/functionality on them. Everything is there and at times can be overwhelming but it's there and pretty handy. And, they've improved on most features by making them more accessible. Beyond that, though, while there are enhancements all around the basic functions of each (word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, etc.) are not much different from 2003. Honestly, I'd be hard pressed to recommend the upgrade unless you just wanted to get up to speed with ""today's"" version. Give the cost and the current economic times, I can't say it's a shoe-in for you. Instead, you've got to decide if you need any specific features or if you're upgrading your OS to Windows 7 and just want the latest and greatest software for that platform. Otherwise, save your money.",4
"VideoStudio Pro X4 is the latest release of Corel's consumer video editing software application. The previous version, X3, wasn't exactly well received by Amazon.com users. Indeed, I myself had a hard enough time with X3 that I uninstalled it within 30 minutes of installing it. When I found out that X4 was being released, I wanted to give it a more thorough look and Corel was kind enough to send me a review license. After using it for about a week, I'm happy to say that it's been fun and a pleasure to edit videos with VideoStudio Pro X4.

PROS:
- Performs well (even w/Core2 Duo processors)
- Short learning curve for basic functions
- Fair number of transition, title, filter, and media samples
- Easy to use and configurable layout
- Multi-monitor support
- Decent set of tutorials
- Great sharing options

CONS:
- More contextual help would make it even easier to learn
- A little sluggish at times
- Cumbersome previewing of media

The question I get asked the most by people who have home videos is, ""How can I put my videos on a DVD so I can share it with others?"" That's a good question. With the popularity of the pocket camcorder, like the Flip, people have made countless video clips. Unfortunately, most of those clips have been imprisoned on the camcorders themselves or if lucky, made their way to a computer. Getting those videos onto a DVD to send to grandparents or friends have been more challenging. VideoStudio Pro X4 (VSPX4) is one way to get those videos onto DVD, but why stop there? You can also use it to upload it to YouTube or Facebook. Before you do that though, how about sprucing up that video first by putting a title graphic on and adding a soundtrack? With VSPX4, it isn't as hard to do as you might think it is.

CAPTURE
VSPX4 is separated into three distinct functions-Capture, Edit, and Share. Capture is the first of those and allows you to easily import videos from a variety of sources. If you already have your videos on your computer, then you can actually skip this part. As a matter of fact, when you first launch VSPX4, it goes straight into Edit, the second and most robust function.

EDIT
If all you want to do is get your video clips onto a DVD or upload them to YouTube, you can pretty much just add them into the ""Project"" and then go to Share and have at it. However, if you wanted to be a little more creative, you can really spruce up that video collection here.

The default layout of the Edit step works well. It's broken down into three sections. On the top left, you have the video screen. On the top right, is your collection of media, filters, transitions, etc. The entire bottom half of the layout is the timeline (or storyboard view). This is where you insert all the videos, effects, and audio. It's pretty intuitive. The timeline reads from left to right and there are multiple rows of ""Tracks."" Tracks consist of the main video track, title tracks, overlay tracks, voice track and music tracks.

Adding elements to these tracks allow you to customize each track and then match them up to work with the entire project. It's amazingly easy to add your own music as a soundtrack or cool effects to express your creative side. While I appreciated having easy access to the media and samples, I found it very cumbersome to preview them to see or hear what they were. For example, VSPX4 comes with 25 sound effect clips named, S1 to S25. In order to hear what those sounds were, I had to select them on the top right side of the screen with my mouse, then go all the way back over to the video screen on the left and hit play. Doing that for every clip got annoying. It would have been better to allow the clips to be double-clicked for automatic preview, or right click on them to present a ""preview"" selection that would automatically play them.

In general however, I thought that manipulating videos was relatively easy and fun. There were some more advanced things that I wanted to do that weren't easy to figure out at first, like Multi-Trim but I eventually figured it out. I liked the voice over feature because when I do video reviews, I can just film the review, split the audio out of it, then plug in a mic and narrate the video while watching it. This is a huge time saver for me because rather than having to perform multiple takes to get the right one, I can just do it once and use VSPX4 to perfect it.

SHARE
The last function of VideoStudio Pro X4 is the share function. This allows you to create a video file, audio file, disc, export to a mobile device, export to a DV camcorder, or upload to Vimeo, YouTube, Facebook, or Flickr. Sharing couldn't be easier. Ok, it could be a little bit easier. There are a lot of options for creating different types of video files and contextual help here would have been nice to help people figure out which type would work best for their needs. The process of creating a video file is called rendering. Rendering can take a long time, depending on how long and complex your video is and the type of file you've chosen to save it as. Knowing which type you should use is important before you render it because you could end up wasting a lot of time waiting for the render to complete, only to find out that the file you created isn't going to work for you. The integration of file sharing sites is a nice touch and very easy to use.

PERFORMANCE
My computer no longer qualifies as a high end system, but still ran VSPX4 very well most of the time. I have an Intel Core2 Duo 2.2GHz machine with 4GB or RAM, running Windows 7 64-bit. Though I comfortably met the minimum system requirements, there were times when I was working on more complex clips that made my preview video stutter. I'd guess if I had an Intel i7 processor with 6-8GB of RAM, I wouldn't encounter any stuttering at all, especially since VSPX4 is optimized for it.

MY PROJECT
Right before I began writing this review, I decided to create one more video project as a way for me to test VSPX4. I chose a 1min 30sec video of me throwing a plush Angry Bird doll at my sister, who was opening up a plush Angry Bird Pig as a gift. Here is what I did with VSPX4 to the clip:

1. I shortened the video to about a minute
2. Added an animated title at the beginning of the clip
3. Added the Angry Birds theme song as the soundtrack
4. Added an Old Film filter to the clip to give a unique look
5. Copied the moment of impact (Bird hitting the Pig/my sister's face) and added a slow motion clip to the end of the original clip
6. Took that same impact clip and added a funny sound effect to it and added it to the end of the original clip
7. Added a photo to the end
8. Added scrolling credits
9. Created an HD video of the entire project
10. Uploaded the clip to YouTube
11. Called my sister to tell her I'd uploaded this embarrassing video of her to YouTube

In case you're wondering, I deleted the video from YouTube after I let her watch it first; I'm a good brother after all!

CONCLUSION
Corel's VideoStudio Pro X4 is a strong video editing package. I wouldn't call it a simple program, but it doesn't take a great deal of time to get the hang of it. Up until a week ago, I had very little exposure to video editing software and now I feel very comfortable using it. VSPX4 has a good selection of tools that'll keep you entertained for hours at a time. I had a blast creating my last clip and I bet you will too.

"Update: 14 AUG 2012

Never much of a graphic artist, I've been scribbling on computers since my parents bought me a VTech Socrates console in 1988. Flash forward to 2011 when I needed something a little more sophisticated to draft models. As it happened AutoCAD LT 2012 came down the Vine.

Regarding this powerful but imperfect 2D drafting program, I write from the perspective of a CAD noob. Amazon Vine later offered me Corel CAD , so I've updated the comparison to go with that review.

--Package--

AutoCAD LT comes in a contemporary DVD case with the serial number and nothing else. No manual in print or PDF. All documentation is through the AutoDesk Exchange splash panel.

--Installation--

The program installs quick, goes down smooth, and fills up less than a gigabyte of storage. Take note of the software license; it includes a Not For Resale restriction that lasts three years. The expiration date is tracked in the product information window, found in the About dialogue of the Help bar. Fortunately, AutoDesk has not harassed me with re-activation notices, junk mail, or product pop ups. Unlike most programs I've experienced, it might be a good idea to read the ""deployment instructions"" online before you install.

--Operation--

From the get go the interface is more overwhelming than Corel CAD, right up there with the clutter of other prosumer applications. I also find AutoCAD's GUI mildly more obtuse than Adobe InDesign; for example, you can see the color and thickness of a selected line in the Home ribbon, but there is no similar field where one can view the coordinates, fill, or dimensions at a glance like you can in Adobe products. Some of this information can be brought up in a property menu, which can then be docked for future use. For noob drafters, sifting through controls can be slowed whenever AutoDesk uses drafting terminology, such as ""plot"" for printing. Veterans who dislike the Drafting and Annotation ribbon can consider the LT Classic command bars.

Actually using the program is tedious at first. Simply trying to select a shape and move it requires a procedure--you don't just grab it like a frame with a left-click and drag it around (dragging is possible with an extra step).

Like InDesign, taking the time to play with buttons and read the knowledge base will familiarize you more quickly than you might think. Beginners should not have to worry about hiring tutors, taking classes, or buying guides unless you are totally new to any sort of design program, in which case you should be practicing on open source programs before plunking a paycheck on this behemoth. The interface loses its cluttered feel and it becomes easy to appreciate the controls at your cursor tip.

Unlike Corel CAD, AutoCAD provides a floating context overlay that follows your mouse cursor. The line can be manipulated on the fly with your choice of a right click menu, arrow key drop down menu, or keyboard command prompting. The overlay also shows at a glance the real time dimension or coordinate as you move the cursor. Once the shape is laid down, AutoCAD provides a variety of grips and handles that allow you to change the dimensions of a shape or relocate the points of the poly line, again with a quick-glance overlay. Hover the cursor over a grip or point and see the length of all lines connected to that point. If you need more tools on the fly, a quick properties window can be toggled to appear near each object or line you select. The disadvantage is that all this feedback can overwhelm the novice user, and it can be easy to set something wrong until you learn the commands.

Returning to that example of moving an object, the procedure allows objects to be placed with a lot less nudging and fudging: using points, displacement, workspace switching, or stretching. Nevertheless, it takes time to get used to the nuances of each mode.

I also feel the right-click context menu should bring up layer and line tools. However, the aforementioned quick properties menu covers them and more.

--Output--

Your models can be saved in a variety of .DWG formats for swapping between older editions of AutoCAD, in addition to DWS (drawing standard) and DWT (Drawing Template). Also export to DGN, PDF and bitmap. Finally you can create a block file to save a particular object or set of objects to be inserted into future models. No TIFF, no SVG, no PNG or JPEG. Instead you can underlay a DWG or PDF, linking it so the current drawing file is not significantly increased. Corel CAD does not appear to have such a capability.

--Performance--

I tested the program on two 64-bit computers running Windows 7 Home Premium:

> My old HP Media Center PC with a Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 4 GBs of Kingston RAM, and a Western Digital 7200 RPM hardrive with SATA 1.0.

>My new Custom Design Rig with an Intel 2500 quad core, 8 GBs of Corsair RAM, and a Crucial M4 solid state drive running through SATA 3.0.

Out of the box, the program is buggy. Without both service packs. I experienced a number of crashes -to-desktop. Most crashes were accompanied by an error window and an opportunity to transmit a report. Even with the packs, the program can still crash if you don't wait for the Exchange panel to load on start up.

Needless to say, LT 2012 is slow to boot on the old Media Center, taking around two minutes. Once loaded, it moved decently enough, but I didn't try to draw anything with a lot of objects. The custom rig leaves flaming CAD tracks across my monitor. After several sessions, the cache of my SSD allows a load time of 5-10 seconds. Comparable to Adobe InDesign. Files also save and load immediately.

Windows 32-bit users can enable a setting in the command prompt to get 3 gigabytes of RAM. Otherwise I recommend that 32-bit users check the AutoDesk forums and the AutoCad knowledge base before buying this program.

--Support--

Autodesk Exchange allows the user to stream help videos or view HTML knowledge base, and so obviously requires an active network connection.  It allowed me to browse and install both service packs without a hitch or a long wait. However, I found the knowledge base articles would be shrunk to very small type and images when trying to print them, or to save them as PDFs with Acrobat 10. Also, it annoyed me that the Exchange did not notify me of the specific patches I needed.

--Utility--

Basically a rebranded Ares CAD, Corel's 2011 program is somewhat faster to learn and easier to use. The license is less restrictive and the help file is more accessible. Corel CAD includes 3D support as well as 2D at half the price or less of LT 2012, supporting many of the same features and file types. It also exports to a wider range of formats: including SVG, JPEG, TIFF, Corel Draw, and Corel Designer.

Otherwise, AutoCAD LT 2012 is a powerful ""prosumer"" program for drafting in 2D. The overwhelming interface is more informative than Corel CAD, and allows objects to be placed or modified with greater precision. Design and Output is relatively narrow but highly customizable. I ultimately prefer to draft in 2D with AutoCAD over Corel. High price tag, bugs in unpatched versions, and some issues with interface all contribute to knock off a star. Sheer precision and capability creates a four-star program.",4
"Prior to installing the Kaspersky Internet Security 2012, I had used McAfee Total Protection, Norton Internet Security and Kaspersky Pure 2011 to protect my computers.  I installed Internet Security 2012 onto my computer by downloading the trial version from the Kaspersky website and then entering the serial number that I had received with my purchase from Amazon.  The license is for three machines.  The clock starts ticking on the license the day that you install Kaspersky Internet Security on the first machine.  Installations on additional machines will expire on the same day as the first machine.

At the end of the installation, you are asked if you would like to participate in the Kaspersky Security Network  This is also referred to as Cloud Protection.  If you opt into this protection, any suspicious or unrecognizable data which is encountered by Kaspersky Internet Security on your computer is automatically sent via the internet to Kaspersky for analysis.  Since the same applies to everyone who has opted into Cloud Protection, Kaspersky claims that they can quickly detect new threats which makes Cloud Protection better for everyone.  It is suggested  that the more people that participate, the better Cloud Protection works.  There is a disclaimer that Kaspersky Lab performs no collection, processing or storage of personal data sent by users.  Cloud Protection is voluntary and you can turn it off at any time.  I have opted not to participate and have not had any nags or other prompts from program to change my mind.

I am running Kaspersky Internet Security on a laptop running Windows 7 Ultimate with an Intel Core i7-2720QM processor with 8 GB of RAM and on a netbook running Windows XP with a Intel Atom 1.6 Ghz processor and 2 GB of RAM.  The netbook has about 10 GB of free space on the hard drive.  I don't notice any appreciable lag in the computing time of either machine as compared to Norton Internet Security, for example.  Nor have I noticed the lag that the prior version of Kaspersky Internet Security caused on my machines during startup.

The interface for Kaspersky Internet Security is nice and uncluttered.  The opening page has only four buttons:  scan, update, parental control and tools.  At the top are buttons for reports and settings.  However creating scheduled scans is not a straightforward as it should be.  You must go under tools / settings, then click on full scan settings, then click on a button that reads ""run mode"".  Why couldn't Kaspersky just put a button that read ""schedule scans""?

A scan of the 750 MB hard drive of my laptop using the standard settings takes several hours.  Reports about the events such as banners that were blocked, scans that were performed and applications that were controlled.  This level of detail in the report may not be needed, but it is nice that it is available if you want to see what Kaspersky Internet Security has been doing.

Some nice features of the scan settings include the ability to set rules for computers which are used for gaming or which run programs which require a lot of resources.  In the case of gaming, there is a specific gaming profile which when set, disables updates and scheduled tasks.  You can also set the software to postpone scheduled tasks in the case of a high load on the CPU.

A nice scan feature is the Vulnerabilities Scan which scans for outdated versions of the software on your computer.  This scan found outdated versions of Firefox, Java and even Photoshop on my computer.  The scan also found vulnerabilities on my computer such as allowing autorun on usb drives or problems with Internet Explorer.  In each case, I was given an internet link to a page which described the problem and the fixes.  In my opinion, this is a very important part of the scan since vulnerabilities in Java or Flash, for example could compromise the security of your computer.  I have been impressed by how quickly Kaspersky Internet Security picks up on problems with the software on my machine.  Thanks to Kaspersky, I often update my software long before I am asked to do so by the software packages themselves.  However, the protection is not without problems.  Even after I update Java, for example, the Vulnerabilities Scan still asks me to update even though I have already installed the version that Kaspersky is requesting.  This problem existed in prior versions of Kaspersky Internet Security as well and I would have liked to have seen Kaspersky correct it by now.

Other nice features include: safe run for applications which allows you to run unknown applications in a safe environment that is isolated from the operating system, Kaspersky Rescue Disk which creates a bootable CD or USB flash drive for eliminating infections and Privacy Cleaner which deletes cookies, logs and other private data.

You have the option of allowing Kaspersky Internet Security to check for updates automatically to manually check for updates.  The documentation with Kaspersky Internet Security indicates that it would be preferred if you let the program update automatically.  However, I have chosen to update manually.  Kaspersky Internet Security gives me warnings every day that updates are not automatic.  I also get warnings if my databases are more than 24 hours out of date.  I would have preferred at least a 2 or 3 day lag before I got these warnings and it is as if Kaspersky Internet Security is trying to nag me to choose automatic updates which I find annoying.

The features of Kaspersky PURE that Kaspersky Internet Security lacks include a more robust identity protection, a password manager, a disaster recovery option where data is backed up online, a more robust computer tune up and a more robust network security.  Although all of those features are nice, if you are just looking to protect your computer itself and don't want or need the features such as password manager, Internet Security is a more cost effective option than PURE.

In summary:
Cons:
- Scheduling scans is not intuitive.  You need to click on a button marked manual to change the virus scans from manual to scheduled and unless you know to click on the button.  Kaspersky should have made it much easier to schedule a virus scan.
- I had to change the default setting to allow for the full scan of USB drives when they are fist detected.  I strongly believe that full scans of USB drives should be the default setting with the allowance that the user can change the setting.  The only time that Kaspersky has found viruses during its scans is when I have plugged in a USB drive that I have used them to get data from someone else's computer.
- Open Vulnerabilities Scan not part of the full scan
-  The Open Vulnerabilities Scan does not recognize when programs with vulnerabilities are updated to the latest version.
-  Nags when the databases are only a day old

Pluses
- Not intrusive on your computer's performance
- Updates even when the network speed is slow
- Very good reputation
- Full of features

Overall, very good protection for your computers.",4
"With the release of iBank version 5 in November 2013, my following review should be read as referring to iBank 5. New purchasers should not download version 4, but should go straight to iBank 5.

iBank won me over from Quicken for Mac, which steadily lost its market lead in personal finance software for the Mac platform after 2007 due to Intuit's failure to provide features on Mac comparable with its Windows-based product range.

iBank is highly capable software from a small company, IGG Software, which has demonstrated serious intent to develop and maintain a first-class niche product line for the Mac platform.

I was able to import 14 years of data from Quicken for Mac into iBank version 4 as a QIF file, and have every account and category - including share transactions and dividends - balance across the entire 14 years.  So I gave up waiting for Intuit to bring out a real update to Quicken for Mac 2007 and migrated to iBank in September 2012 - after testing and familiarization over a span of 18 months. I have not regretted the move, except that I should have done it earlier.

iBank had a new version 4.7 release in early February 2013; with a 4.7.1 update in early March; 4.7.2 in mid April; 4.7.3 at the end of July; 4.7.4 in mid October; and 4.7.5 in early November - all free online downloads to existing users. The new version 5, with an upgrade price of $29.99 to existing iBank users, was released in late November 2013. iBank 5 has some evolutionary improvements, such as categorization of investment income and some de-cluttering of the user interface, and has been an easy transition so far.

In itself the version number evolution says a lot about the high level of product support and development by its makers, IGG Software. The application has had numerous free online updates with significant new features. I bought and began experimenting with it at version 3. After my initial purchase (US$59.99) I have had to pay only for the two full version upgrades - a mere US$29.99 for the upgrades to version 4, and version 5. Any price under $100 for well-supported software of this quality and range of features is exceptional value for money.

As at November 2013, I have been using iBank almost daily for more than a year - currently in Mac OS X version 10.9 (Mavericks) - and have found it very stable with no obvious bugs. Earlier I found it just as stable in 10.8.5 (Mountain Lion), OSX 10.7.5 (Lion) and OS X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) -- Snow Leopard being the last operating system supporting the PowerPC application translator Rosetta, which was required for Quicken for Mac 2007.

Some features I especially like about iBank:

* Support for file exchange with other financial software, including ability to import QIF, OFX, QFX and CSV files; and to export its data in QIF or TXF format. Since version 4.7, released in February 2013, iBank has included further support for data import from Quicken Essentials for Mac, an unspeakable product from which Intuit inexplicably dropped QIF. The export format options provide a degree of confidence and safety in case it is necessary to migrate to other applications in future, or to exchange data with financial advisers using other apps. The QIF import is so reliable that I was able to import a file containing 14 years of detailed financial data from Quicken for Mac 2007 and every account balanced accurately. Minor problems I noticed in importing the QIF, and which could be corrected only manually, were:
1. Text in Quicken's distribution memo field did not come across for transactions where there was only one distribution (any text in Quicken's top memo field, the one visible without a ""twistie"", does transfer);
2. some currency symbols I had entered in Quicken payee and memo fields, like  and the Euro symbol, came across as the angled apostrophe, '; and
3. accented characters in payee and memo fields, e.g. ; and ;, dropped out entirely.

* Multiple currencies. This is really neat. Cash or bank accounts are easily set up in foreign currencies, with online downloadable exchange rates which all update with a single mouse click on a menu command or button. Also, accounts like credit cards that you might use for foreign currency transactions while travelling, or online shopping, easily can record both the home currency and foreign currency amounts - automatically calculating the effective exchange rate of each transaction based on the difference. Worked a treat for recording cash and credit card transactions in eight different currencies during my recent travels through Europe, South America and China.

* Reconciliation of bank and credit card accounts with statements is fast and easy. Super fast if the start and finish amounts in statements match those on corresponding dates in recorded account data: one click on the dropdown menu option ""Automatically reconcile : All transactions"", and you're done (regardless of whether the statement is one or 50 pages long). The manual reconciliation process is well-designed, with a large, easy-to-click reconciliation button on each transaction, and corrections possible while reconciliation is in progress. iBank archives ""virtual statements"" mirroring every reconciled statement. These can be reviewed as necessary at any time.

* Drag-and-drop works easily and intuitively for some uses, including changing the order of transactions on the same date. (A transaction cannot be dragged and dropped to a different funding account, but can be easily cut and pasted from one funding account to another).

* Payee and memo fields hold much more text than Quicken for Mac 2007 - so much more I can't even determine the limit. This makes it easy to enter full payee names and addresses, and detailed transaction descriptions. Foreign language characters - even Chinese (impossible in Quicken for Mac 2007) - can be entered in payee and memo fields, because iBank is fully compatible with the excellent built-in foreign language support of the Mac operating system.

* Invoices, receipts, correspondence, digital photos or other documentation can be attached in PDF or other formats to individual transactions. Only one file per transaction is attachable, but multiple documents (e.g. invoice, receipt and an image) can be attached if these are merged into one multi-page document such as a Word document or Acrobat PDF. (Version 4.6.1 appears to have fixed a glitch that prevented the document link opening in the Finder when clicked in iBank.) A very nice aspect of this feature is that iBank actually embeds the attached document in its current file; it does not merely use a link or path which could be broken due to disk reorganization or backup to other volumes. I like this feature so much that I've used it to retrospectively add PDF scans of receipts for major purchases going back years, where document retrieval might be necessary for warranties.

* The ""find"" feature indicated by a magnifying glass icon in the top right of the account view window is simple, fast and intuitive for searching and finding transaction payees, memos, or amounts. This ""find"" feature works either within single or grouped accounts, but not within reports.

* The built-in calculator, with simulated paper tape, under the ""Manage"" menu - from which results can be more conveniently copied and pasted as iBank transaction figures than from a desktop utility calculator.

* Simple mathematical calculations and formulas can also be entered in deposit and withdrawal amounts fields. As the manual states: 'For example, if you type ""5+3"" in the deposit field, iBank will automatically record a value of ""8.00"". Multiplication (*) and division (/) are performed before addition (+) and subtraction (-). Amounts are rounded to two decimal places. To specify the order of operations, you may group together parts of the calculation using square brackets [ ]. For example, if you enter ""[1/2]*[4-3]"" in the withdrawal field, iBank will calculate an amount of ""(0.50)"".' Type the figures for calculation or formulas, hit the ""Enter"" key, and the result enters.

* Reports including tax reports, investment portfolio statements, and net worth statements (balance sheets) can be generated on a range of standard templates, or with customized dates and content. The standard ""Portfolio Summary"" report, for example, is a time-saver and handy for tracking share investments, downloading latest available online quotes in one click for an entire portfolio when the correct stock exchange code and stock symbol have been recorded in iBank ""Manage:Securities"".

* Clicking on any single-line category total in a report - for example, ""credit card"", ""utilities"", ""misc expenses"" - will open a detailed full list of transactions for that category.

* Scheduled transactions include an option to automatically create an event and reminder in iCal. If the transaction is later edited, for instance, with a different amount, this updates the iCal event too. Neat.

One of the few important features lacking is global ""find and replace"". For example, this would speed up correction of the minor import errors in memo fields I mentioned above - or correction of inconsistencies that commonly develop in input of payee details. Multiple criteria search would be a useful future enhancement of the current simple search feature, too.

iBank also could be improved with a larger set - or, better yet, sets grouped by functional association - of report templates consistent with standard accounting practice and various tax reporting requirements, including more user customisation of content and format (fonts, column widths etc.). Graphs cannot be excluded in version 4+ from some standard reports such as income and expense reports and net worth statements. However, graphs don't appear in category reports (which might also be thought of as transaction reports), the content of which is flexible and text-only. Users with specific reporting needs, formatting requirements, or a need to create custom graphs, may have to copy and paste or drag and drop data into Microsoft Excel. That's not too difficult: it's just another step that would be useful as a built-in time-saving feature in future upgrades.

iBank has its own look and feel: it is not merely a knock-off or update version of Quicken or any other finance application, as far as I can see. Anyone coming to it from another application, or for the first time, needs to invest some time to familiarize themselves with it. This necessarily includes some reading of the built-in help manual and online support to learn its specific ways of displaying, entering and retrieving data. However, much will look familiar immediately to anyone experienced with the Mac OS and long-established principles of double-entry financial accounting. I have found the transition from Quicken to iBank much, much easier than the last big financial data migration I made about 2000, when my first Mac-based accounting program, which I used from 1985, Dollars & $ense, succumbed to the Y2K bug.

Overall, iBank version 4+ is already a great personal finance software application. I highly recommend it to any Mac users seeking flexible, powerful and up-to-date features in this class of software - especially those like me, who have been seeking a successor to Quicken for Mac 2007. As it does not have features like payroll, inventory and invoicing, or multi-user and network capability, it better suits personal and household financial record-keeping than business accounts. Mac users seeking a financial accounting package suitable for any but the smallest and least complicated businesses - which might be handled in iBank - need to look at more expensive software designed for business, like MYOB's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FirstEdge-for-Mac-Small-Business-Management-and-Accounting/dp/B000065ERY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FirstEdge for Mac - Small Business Management and Accounting</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Accountedge-for-Mac-Includes-Network-Edition/dp/B0039SPNFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Accountedge for Mac Includes Network Edition</a>, or Intuit's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/QuickBooks-for-Mac-2013-Download/dp/B008S0IV9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">QuickBooks for Mac 2013 [Download</a>].",4
"THE QUICK TAKE:  Family Tree Maker 2012 is useful as a tool to organize and collect your information and related media (photos, documents, stories) about your family history.  However, the really powerful tool is Ancestry.com.  Ancestry should help you greatly expand what you know, not just organize what you know.  FTM 2012 Deluxe includes a three month membership to Ancestry.com, so if you use it well you can get a lot of value from this package.

Before I get into the details of the review, some general advice:

 - Talk to your older living relatives now, while they are still around.  Try to get the stories, copies of photos, find out who is in the photos, and so on.  You won't be able to do that later.

 - Keep backup copies of all your files, and backup your files before you make any substantial changes or sync your tree.  Work on the assumption that you will have computer problems or a hard drive failure, because at some point you will.  You're going to put a lot of work into your family history, you want to make sure you always have a copy.

GET PREPARED BEFORE YOU START:  To protect the privacy of living people, government records aren't made available for decades.  So before you start using Ancestry and FTM, try to find out some details about your parents and your grandparents - birth, marriage, death, places they lived.  Then you'll be able to start to link to the publicly available information online.  Without information on your recent ancestors, it will be hard to get very far.

FAMILY TREE MAKER IS USEFUL:  FTM is a useful tool.  It seems reasonably easy to use even for those less expert at using the web and computers.  For example, there are tools to allow you to capture text and photos from the web.

The tutorials are worth reviewing.  They are well done, brief, and will help get you started on key tasks.

The software can also do some tasks that you can't currently do on the website, such as split and join trees.

For me, the software installed easily on an older XP machine.  It needs .net 4.0 to run, so will install that if it's not already installed.  FTM Deluxe 2012 comes on 2 CDs, one with the software and the other with the PDF books in the Family History Took Kit (see below for a list).

REGISTER LATER?  When you first run Family Tree Maker, it asks if you want to register the software.  You may want to wait to register, as that seems to start your three months subscription to Ancestry.  You may want to organize yourself a little, and get the basic facts about your family, before you go online.

ANCESTRY.COM IS POWERFUL:  I was able to find a lot of additional information about the ancestors I knew I had, and turn up some new ancestors and new connections.  I found Ancestry's hints and matching to be useful, but then I guess I don't mind searching through dozens of possible matches to see which ones are a fit.

CHECK ALTERNATE SPELLINGS:  Census records are surprisingly uneven in terms of the accuracy of names.  If you can't find what you're looking for, try searching on alternate spellings of a name.

INCLUDE THE WHOLE FAMILY:  Even if your interest is primarily in your ancestors, it's very useful to add the data about all their siblings to your tree, for two reasons.  First, it's incredibly helpful to match the data when you have more than just one person.  Knowing the names and ages of siblings can make it clear whether another record is your family, or not.  It helps confirm a link when a name is common, or when there are mis-spellings.  Second, it makes the story much more interesting to see who was in your ancestor's family and what was happening in their lives.

BE SKEPTICAL:  There are a lot of mistakes in the family trees already online, so don't assume that someone else has done their homework unless there is backup.

KEEP TRACK OF YOUR SOURCES:  Don't rely on your memory.  Make notes and add documents to support the info in your tree.

CENSUS DATA IS INTERESTING, REALLY!:  I found myself surprised at the amount of data in the census.  It collects several interesting facts if you review it carefully.  It's also interesting to see what happens over time to families - the joy of births, tragedy of deaths and mysteries of life. (For example, why was great grandma living apart from great grandpa, and telling the census she was a widow?)

DON'T UNDERESTIMATE GOOGLE:  I chuckled a little that FTM includes Google as a link.  But it's probably not obvious to everyone, and so it's worth saying.  I've turned up a lot of useful information searching on Google, though it really helps to use a targeted search and to try a few alternatives.

CHECK ROOTSWEB:  There are a number of family trees on RootsWeb as well.  It's worth searching for your family.  It can be a useful starting point in your research, but be sure to verify the information, and also make sure it's really your family.

PLAN ON A LONG PROCESS:  Most people spend a little time over years or decades collecting information about their family.  While you can make a lot of progress in a short time, filling out more details or finding new ancestors can take a long time.

CANCELING IS EASY:  Note that if you don't want your subcription to auto-renew, you need to cancel it.  You can do that anytime, and still use the balance of your subscription.  It takes several clicks online, but it's not hard to cancel.

PRINTED MANUAL INCLUDED:  I appreciate that they have included a printed manual for the software.  That's a corner that many other companies cut to save costs, a false saving in my opinion.

FAMILY HISTORY TOOL KIT:  The following PDFs are included as part of the Family History Tool Kit.  They look like useful information, but don't feel that you need to read them to get started.

 - Abbreviations and Acronyms: A Guide for Family Historians - List and explanation of abbreviations and acronyms found in census schedules, soundex indexes, mortality schedules, court records, etc.

 - Ancestry's Concise Genealogical Dictionary - Definitions of unusual terms, especially in cemetery, probate, court, medical, etc.

 - Hidden Sources: Family History in Unlikely Places - Overview of sources that are often overlooked, where and how they can be found, etc.

 - Printed Sources: A Guide to Published Genealogical Records - Guide to printed sources such as vital records, definitions and explanations of how to use them.

 - The Official Guide to Ancestry.com - Become more proficient with searching the site. Explore obscure databases you didn't know existed. Create and develop your own family tree.

 - The Official Guide to RootsWeb - How to use RootsWeb, and success stories of the RootsWeb Community.",4
"Quickbooks for Mac has come a long way since my last  and not-so-positive review of the 2010 version.

It's now stable, attractive and quite capable for many businesses.  If you have never used Quickbooks before,  give the Mac version a try for your business.  If your company deals with a single currency, is service-oriented, or if product-oriented has simple inventory needs, Quickbooks for Mac 2013 could fit your needs well.

My wife and I still use Quickbooks for Windows on our Macs for about a dozen companies by running the Windows version under&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Parallels-Desktop-8-for-Mac/dp/B008YTAKJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Parallels Desktop 8 for Mac</a>.  But, for several of these companies, Quickbooks for Mac is now a viable option.  It still lacks the full feature sets of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/QuickBooks-Pro-2013-Download/dp/B008S0IWNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">QuickBooks Pro 2013 [Download</a>], much less&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/QuickBooks-Accountant-2013-Download/dp/B008S0J1G8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">QuickBooks Accountant 2013 [Download</a>], which is why most of the companies we work with will stay on the Windows version for now in spite of the additional complexity of running Parallels Desktop on our Macs.

Quickbooks for Mac 2013 permits batch invoicing (perfect for homeowner's associations and businesses that bill a group of clients a similar amount), payments via Intuit Payment Network (no monthly fee e-checks and credit card payments), and the ability to attach documents to transactions.  It supports up to 5 users on the same local network working in one company file at the same time (per-user licenses required), with user-permissions that limit what each person can see and do.  Since 2012, it has supported progress or phased invoices, useful for contractors and architects, for example.

QBMac still uses the floating window paradigm, one which Apple, Adobe and others are moving away from for Mac applications  (e.g., Aperture, Final Cut, iMovie, iPhoto, Photoshop, Dreamweaver), but it remembers the last location and size of each window, so you can create a working layout of activity windows that suits your needs - you'll just see whatever other application windows are behind these as with all old-style Mac apps.

The new Guide Me window automatically changes its content to reflect help and guidance for whatever you are doing, however many of the videos simply display ""Work in Progress"" when you click on them.  Some of those that do work have muddy sound and are compressed so much that you cannot read the screen text.

A personal thing due to my age:  Most program text in QBMac is quite small on my 27"" Apple LED Cinema display which, as with most Apple laptops, has a higher pixels-per-inch PPI than older monitors.  I'd like to see Intuit give us the option of changing the type size, the size of which strains my aging eyes, even with special computer glasses.  It is the tiniest text of any program I work with.  (Palette text in some other programs is the same size - but not functional dialogs/windows.  My workaround is to drag QBMac onto an old secondary monitor that is 72 ppi.)  An exception to this is the left-column list of customer:jobs, vendors, etc in the Invoice, Enter Bills etc windows - this is extremely readable for me.  Registers, not so much.  I don't need any of Apple's 'Universal Access' features for anything else on my Mac, so adding 'zoom' or changing from non-native screen resolution just for QBMac is not something I'm willing to consider.

For the few companies I have that would work with the feature set of Quickbooks for Mac, there are still small things that will keep me on the Windows version... but only because it's already running on my Mac.  If I wasn't already set up with Quickbooks for Windows, I might force myself to live with these issues in Quickbooks for Mac:

1.  Consultants, attorneys, accountants, architects, graphics artists, etc. often like to record their time while the work is actually being done.  The QBWin Enter Single Activity window has a timer built-in.  It's so easy to start the timer and add additional notes as you work on a task.  If the phone rings, or you have to work on another task for a while, just stop that activity, to be returned to later, and start a new one for the phone call.  Etc.  When you return to an earlier activity, just start the timer again to continue on, adding additional notes and obtaining a total time entry for that one task which can later be transferred, with the notes (optional), as a single line to an invoice.  With QBMac, there is no built-in timer.  Instead, you must download the separate My Time application via the Customers > Time Tracking > Download My Time menu, and remember to refresh its lists every time you add or edit a customer:job or billable item (no dynamic linking to your company data).  My Time saves a separate time entry each time you pause it.  These entries can be merged when you export back into QBMac, but not with the same per-activity result as QBWin if you continue to add additional notes for what is intended as a single billable entry.  In general, I find having to launch a separate app (My Time) that requires management and export to keep the company file up to date an unnecessary additional level of complexity over time tracking within QBWin.  QBMac just needs to add a timer button to their Single Activity window, as has been requested for many years.

2.  QBMac now allows very long Notes fields for time and invoice entries, and thus is able to import that data from a QBWin file without data loss.  (QBMac 2010, e.g., truncated all imported notes and did not allow data entry of long notes.)  However, none of those fields expands to show the data or displays a scroll bar.  For example, in an invoice, only a single line is displayed - making it nearly impossible to edit a multi-line note.  You can only see the multiple lines if you switch to preview mode - but you cannot edit there.  (This contrasts with the Windows version which wraps the notes in the invoice, giving a live, editable preview.)

3.  QBMac doesn't work with Intuit's convenient GoPayment system unless you sign up for a merchant services account at a monthly fee.  For QBWin users, GoPayment is free of fees other than transaction fees.

4.  QBMac still only works with Intuit's online payroll, which starts at $25/month.  This $300 per year compares to the street price of about $50/year for the basic 3-employee payroll for QBWin.  One company we have has a single part-time employee with under $4,000/year in wages.  The $300/year Intuit fee is just unreasonable for us.

5.  Column width cannot be changed in forms (Bills, Invoices, General Journal, etc) - and thus complete data cannot be read.  For example, if you have nested subaccounts, you'll have no idea what the actual account is by viewing one of these forms unless you click on the account control. Ditto customer:job if the customer name is long.  Dynamic column resizing (and remembering user preferences) is essential (and works in the Windows version).

Conversion of QBWin files to QBMac format improves each year, for those who are either migrating, or need to send their file back and forth to a bookkeeper or accountant on the other platform.  As always, it is important to know what things do convert and which things do not.  QBMac does not have a means of importing accountant changes or journal entries, and so if a file is sent to an accountant, the QBMac user must not do anything in their copy of the file until they receive the file back from the accountant/bookkeeper.  (This differs from the abilities of QBWin.)

Bottom line:  Quickbooks for Mac 2013 is a solid release that can address the bookkeeping needs of many types of small businesses.  Intuit offers a free trial, and I encourage you to download it to see if your business needs are met by the product.  For myself, as a Quickbooks for Windows user who wants to switch, Intuit needs to resolve the issues in this review before I would migrate.  Naturally, I also look forward to the day that the Mac product achieves feature-parity with the Windows product so that we can completely leave Windows behind.",4
"I give this 4.5 stars instead of 5 mainly for the lack of automatic photostitch capability. (10/19/13 Update: Since this is basically identical to X6 and I gave that ""4.5"", it's only fair to ""increase"" this too.)

The interface for X5 looks identical to X4 but with a few more options here and there, so I don't have to relearn everything. One thing I was surprised about was after the initial install (I bought it the day Corel offered it for sale) when I went to close the program it said there was an update and installed Service Pack 1.

The package includes Creative_Collection, a separate 427MB installer file.  Corel's website says it adds dozens of new brushes, textures, and over 100 royalty-free backgrounds. I would say that if you are only retouching photos, you probably don't need to run Creative_Collection.

On startup, X5 displays Corel Guide. Two new tabs have been added, Learn and Do More.  Learn links to a handful of YouTube OVERVIEW videos ranging from under 2 to under 6 minutes each. There are no detailed tutorials in the Guide and no way to add links. I've found a LOT of tutorials on YouTube that are helpful and it would be nice to be able to link directly to them. Do More has links to download more Picture Frames, Brushes, etc., and links to Help for those. The Guide can be opened any time from the Help menu.

One feature not in X4 or X5 is photo-stitch capability, such as Photoshop Elements Panorama, that can take various overlapping images and AUTOMATICALLY combine them into a larger image. (Photo-stitch is not the same as X5's photo-blend.) I am mainly using X4 (now X5) to edit scans of old yearbooks, which often involves stitching together two letter-size pages (8-bit RGB 400 dpi) to 11x17 when an image crosses two pages.  I basically use Photoshop Elements for that, then open the PSD file with PaintShop Pro for the rest of the editing.

7/4/2013 UPDATE: I found a free application on SourceForge named Hugin Panorama used for photostitching, although I haven't tried it.

10/21/12 UPDATE: I previously said I could not manually photo stitch two 8.5x11x400dpi RGB images due to repeated crashing. I just found out the problem is I was running a multiple-clipboard utility called Spartan. Whenever I would copy something to the clipboard it was storing a copy. Apparently the utility was getting ""clogged"" due to the size of the files.  I just tried photo stitch without Spartan running and X5 doesn't crash.

A problem that first appeared for me in X4 and is also in X5 is I cannot scan more than one image without doing a save.  (8-bit RGB 400 dpi). When I do the second scan it crashes. [THIS IS PROBABLY ALSO DUE TO SPARTAN.] To scan multiple pages one after the other I have to use IrfanView. (IrfanView has a lot of nice auto-number features, so I'll probably keep using it.)

By the way, although I haven't tried it with X5, when I had both X3 and X4 installed I found that once I saved a file as type .pspimage from X4, X3 didn't recognize it as a valid .pspimage file anymore and wouldn't open it.  (Created in X3, opened and saved in X4, no longer X3 compatible.) I assume the same incompatibility exists between X3 and X5.  So if you need to save layers, etc., and switch between X5 and pre-X4 versions, save as a different file type such as Photoshop .psd.

Face recognition is new in X5. On a large set of images of the same person (several photo sets) it did a fairly good job of grouping them, but mainly where the angle, etc., of the face was pretty similar.

Like X4, there are three main sections, Manage, Adjust and Edit, and you can quickly switch between them with tabs in the middle of the Windows title bar. Adjust has a whole new set of Instant Effects with thumbnails showing the effect.  They range from corrective to artistic.

Something I and others have reported with X3 and X4 that I haven't seen in X5 is that when run it from the Start menu sometimes a message would appear that the program was damaged or illegally modified and needed to be reinstalled.  I have found that sometimes rebooting got rid of the problem.  Alternatively, the Start Menu entry is actually a shortcut. Double-clicking directly on the C:\Program Files\Corel\Corel PaintShop Pro X[whatever]\Corel PaintShop Pro.exe file would usually work. The program is NOT damaged or modified, the problem occurs with several versions of X3 and X4, and reinstalling does NOT fix the problem. But so far I haven't seen it in X5.

The difference between X4/X5 and Ultimate is Ultimate comes with several additional items in a Bonus Pack program. Two add-ons are Nik Color Efex Pro 3.0 over 250 effects and styles, along with 30+ emulated film types in 52 filters and over 200 additional Picture Tubes.  Picture Tubes are small images that can be ""stamped"" repeatedly onto a photo for artistic effect.  For instance, you might want to add a butterfly picture tube onto a meadow scene or a bubble picture tube or a star picture tube.

New in X5 Ultimate is the FaceFilter Studio 2 program from Reallusion. This is a completely separate program specifically for MINOR TOUCHUP of faces. The interface is pretty NON-intuitive--ALL icons, NO drop-downs or text-labelled buttons and no Help. It basically lets you change skin color, eye color, AND EXPRESSION. No change hair color, etc. In the Select Expression screen (Ctrl+4), if you click the button at the lower right next to Keep Result it shows thumbnails of the person with each expression applied. Click on a thumbnail and the After image will change. The altered expression can be exaggerated, so the Expression Strengh slider can be used to reduce the effect. The ""Expression"" can include things like changing the nose width (e.g., Elegant), not just lip and eye position. If you do a lot of portrait touch-up you'll probably want something like Portrait Professional instead.

The following is not specifically about X5 but may be useful: I used X5 to convert a PNG color scan of a yearbook black-and-white image to black and white using various techniques and these were the resulting file sizes. Chan means use Adjust => Color => Channel Mixer with output as monochrome. Sat-100 means set Saturation (Shift-H) to -100. 32k Chan means first decrease number of colors to 32k, then use Channel Mixer set as monochrome.

SOURCE FILE: 400dpi 24-bit RGB, PNG format. Scan of yearbook black and white homeroom photo.

1) Size: 52,141,230 Format: RGB 24-bit, LZW compression TIFF
2) Size: 42,102,300 Format: RGB 24-bit, 16.7 million colors PNG THIS IS THE SCAN.
3) Size: 30,496,028 Format: 64k colors, RGB
4) Size: 29,252,953 Format: 32k Chan, LZW compression TIFF
5) Size: 26,666,605 Format: 32k RGB
6) Size: 20,640,645 Format: 64k Sat-100 (Saturation to -100)
7) Size: 20,411,412 Format: Sat-100
8) Size: 20,330,961 Format: Chan (Channel Mixer set to monochrome) [SEE NOTE]
9) Size: 17,172,578 Format: 32k Sat-100
10) Size: 17,119,155 Format: 64k Chan interlaced
11) Size: 15,017,936 Format: 8-bit grayscale
12) Size: 13,032,349 Format: 32k Chan
13) Size: 13,032,349 Format: 64k Chan NON-interlaced

NOTE: Interestingly, when using Channel Mixer conversion to monochrome I wound up going from 121k colors reduced to 64k colors, but the actual Monochrome images only had 28-32 colors! And yet the images look the same as the grayscale, which have 256 colors.",4
"PROS:
Best voice recognition/dictation software available for the Mac
Very similar to the PC product
Quick learning curve
Easy set up
Set up and ready to dictate in under an hour
Works well with Microsoft Word

CONS:
Resource hog
Doesn't always behave like a Mac program
Crashes/hangs (far less frequent with recent software update and upgrade in my RAM, but still occurs)
Doesn't work as well with Pages or OpenOffice
Doesn't play well with less conventional word processors
Somewhat flimsy technical support, but does have a  robust website-based support for the first 90 days

MY SET UP:  before I get too deep into the review, I need to tell you what equipment I am using.  My iMac is a 21.5, mid 2011, 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5 (quad core), 12 GB 1333 MHz DDR3, AMD Radeon HD 6750M 512 MB graphics card, running OS X 10.8.2.  (This is not the latest and greatest iMac out there, but is more than powerful enough to exceed Nuance's specs for this product.  Moreover, this machine is far more powered than my comparison machine, my work PC which is an HP Compaq 8000 Elite, with a paltry 3 GHz, Core 2 Duo processor and only 4 GB of memory, running Windows XP and Dragon Naturally Speaking 11.5.)

THE QUICK OVERVIEW:
When it comes to voice dictation software, the Dragon has taken over.

There might have been some early rivals a while back that were jockeying for position and there are definitely rivals out there for the commercial market... and, who knows, giants like Apple and Google have pretty amazing voice recognition software in their own right; but, at this point in time, the only realistic choice in dictation software for the home consumer these days is Nuance's Dragon Naturally Speaking. That said, Dragon Dictate is their Mac version.

On the whole, this is capable software, on par with Nuance's product for the PC.  But do realize that the Mac version is only 3.0 and Nuance is already on Dragon 12.0 for the PC.  The products work similarly, but the PC product is definitely more mature.  Secondly, Nuance hasn't exactly figured out how to tap into the 'Macness' of OS X.  The software definitely works after a fashion, but sometimes behaves like a rude tourist, not always integrating well with OSX's feature set and is often a major resource hog.

What your get in the end is reasonable voice dictation/recognition software that definitely does the job, but is still a little rough around the edges.

***AN IMPORTANT ASIDE: Nuance released this product a bit too early.  Prior to the latest software patch, it crashed often or would cause my Mac to hang such that I would have to force quit the program frequently.  This probably explains some of the more negative reviews on this site.  After the last software patch (and an upgrade of RAM), it now functions respectably on my machine.  That said, I would make sure that your Mac exceeds the suggested specs before you run out and buy this program.

WHAT'S IN THE BOX:
The product comes with a CD, quick start guide, and a USB headset.  As equipment goes, the headset is meant for basic dictation.  The sound from the single earpiece is not audiophile quality (nor would you be expecting this).  The mic has more than good enough sound for voice dictation. It is reasonably constructed from plastic.  It is not the most comfortable headset I've ever used but was more than serviceable for dictation purposes.

SET UP:
The installation was intuitive and nearly automatic, but for whatever reason took quite some time.  After installation, you have to set up your profile for voice recognition/dictation.  Each user needs a different profile, as the software needs to adapt itself to the quality of your voice.  This consists of setting up the audio source.  For reasons that are unclear to me, the default source--even with the headset plugged in--was the 'Dragon Remote Microphone.'  This would be good for, say, using your iPhone to dictate into the system, but will not work with the headset.  This needs to be changed with a simple toggle.  You choose spelling (American or British). You can then choose from a variety of accents from American (standard/inland Northern/Southern/teen),British, Indian, Latino, and Southeast Asian.  You then wait a while again for Dragon to set up the profile and load the spelling and grammar files.  After a quick microphone check.  You then proceed to voice training, where you can choose from a variety of passages from easy to 'medium' reading so that Dragon can get used to your voice.  It performs various calibrations and then sets up the profile.  You can then opt for Dragon to scan your old documents for unique vocabulary (a time consuming process that can be done later.)

When all is said and done, from set up to training, you should be up and running with Dragon within 45 minutes to an hour (so long as you save the document scan for later).  This may seem like a long time, but when you compare this to older versions of Dragon, it is actually pretty speedy.

THE EXPERIENCE:
Dictating  with the Dragon software is definitely something that  has a learning curve. You have to get used to the quirks of the program. However, even with these quirks,  I believe you'll find that Dragon can still outpace even the fastest of typists. You will need to learn how to speak clearly so that the program can understand you, remember to speak with punctuation so that it is added within the text, and you need to learn how to correct text without using the keyboard, so you can gain maximum speed. Generally,  The program does a bang up job when it comes to standard dictation and voice recognition.

SIMPLE DICTATION:
The experience is somewhat software dependent. If you're looking at straight dictation, the best program to work with seems to be Microsoft Word.  This is probably the  word processor most used in businesses and integrating with Microsoft Word is likely the highest priority for Nuance. Microsoft Word even has it's own set of integrated commands.

The same cannot be said of other word processors, such as OpenOffice and Apple's Pages, where the spacing is sometimes quirky and where capitalizations don't always occur automatically at the beginning of a paragraph and may even occur mid sentence.

Even with these issues,  I can still dictate by voice much faster than I can type, but this does add to the proofreading.  These kinds of problems are compounded in less conventional programs, such as Writer, where corrections can sometimes lead to dropped characters and can throw off the formatting.

Once you get used to use the system, Dragon definitely delivers on dictation. It is easy to use and set up and the dictation is fast and accurate.

(Note:  As you can imagine, the English language has many words that sound like or need to be spelled differently in different contexts.  No voice dictation system, even a smart dictation system, will be perfectly accurate at this point. After dictating, it is always necessary to edit carefully.)

COMMANDS:
I do use Dragon to launch  and close programs occasionally. However, I'm not a power user when it comes to hands-free use of the Mac. I'm sure if someone put their mind to it, they could get Dragon to do pretty much anything they wanted it to do. However, one major criticism is that Dragon does not integrate with OS X in the same way that it integrates with garden varieties of Windows. I can launch Pages, for example, by saying,""launch Pages.""  But even in command mode, pages doesn't always close when I say, ""close  Pages."" Moreover, when I open Pages, I am able to select an old document, but it isn't very clear  how to get Dragon to open a new document. I gave up just hit the document button.

In Windows, all this runs more smoothly and more intuitively.  Dragon seems more at home in the Windows world.  However, it is quite possible that over time I will become more facile at getting Dragon to cooperate with OS X, however this was not necessary in the Windows version.

THE INTERFACE:
I am a big fan of Apple's upper taskbar. It definitely keeps things simple and keeps all controls for all programs in one place.  I realize that Apple doesn't like clunky command bars, but even clunky command bars can serve a purpose.

Dragon's interface for OS X is a floating rectangle. There is a button to toggle the microphone off and on, change voice recognition modes, toggle dictation, and toggle spelling. It is perhaps a minimalist and elegant interface befitting  OS X. However, it is far less practical than the long, albeit somewhat unsightly, toolbar that is available for Windows users. Instead of simply  clicking on the thing I need to control Dragon, I have to toggle Dragon so that commands appear in the upper taskbar and then I need to find what I'm looking for one of the embedded menus. This may not seem like a lot, but having to use two to three clicks instead of one is no bargain in my book.  In the greater scheme of things, it may not add a lot of time, but it does add to the frustration of using this program. Unfortunately, on the Apple version, there is not even an option for Dragon toolbar.

CRASHES/HANGS:
After the most recent update, I've had many fewer crashes. However, Dragon still occasionally freezes and has to be forced to quit. This happens more often when I'm running other programs. As noted above, my iMac is no slouch, with a quad core, i5 Intel processor with 12 GB of RAM.  There should be more than enough processing power to go around and with enough RAM to satisfy the most memory thirsty programs out there.  Nevertheless, I still get multicolored beach ball at times. This was far  more common when I tried to run Dragon with only 4 GB of RAM. But even after the RAM upgrade crashes and hangs  were still pronounced until Dragon updated their software.

Now I get occasional hangs, but  crashes are few and far between. When I first received the software  frequent hangs and crashes made the software nearly unusable. This was shocking to me  as Dragon worked far better on my older, dual core PC with 4 GB of RAM and the geriatric windows XP operating system. Happily, the combination of beefing up my RAM and the Dragon software patch seem to have cleared  up the bulk of the problems.  (One advantage of the Mac version is that I only have to force quit and restart Dragon when there are problems.  On the Windows version I usually have to reboot the system to clear up resource sharing errors, C+ runtime errors, and file sharing problems.)

That said, Dragon has a habit of not playing well with the other children. On my PC, Dragon also has tendency to crash, if I don't keep XP happy by shutting down and restarting at least once every two weeks. This is likely due to some kind of resource sharing conflict--possibly with Word itself--after Windows has been running continuously without a cleansing reboot. There are times, in Windows, where it won't allow me to save or open a user profile because another program is using the files (What other program uses these files?!?) The program can be temperamentally glitchy, but this is the nature of the beast at this point.  The fact that using Dragon (on Windows or the Mac) saves me incredible amounts of time doesn't justify the awful software issues, but it does mean that it is still incredibly useful and that I will continue to use this product.

CUSTOMER SUPPORT:
Nuance is notoriously flimsy when it comes to personal, customer support. I did not contact customer support for this product, but in the past they offered a support ticket system free of charge for only 90 days. (This is far better than their old system, which--not unlike getting arrested--allowed for only one, unpaid phone call for support.)  Unless it is pathetically simple, phone queries basically generated an online ticket-type response system.  Not bad, but not all that personal and sometimes it is hard to solve such things on a glorified email system. (My guess is that they reserve the excellent phone support for their corporate customers.)

After 90 days you are basically out of luck unless you want to spend just less than 10 dollars for an online query or 19 dollars+ to speak to a technician on the phone. They do, however, have a large database of answered questions on their site and they also have a very active forum where some generous superusers can get you out of a whole heap of trouble. (I contrast this with other companies where a technician actually will spend some time on the phone and they don't drop you like a hot potato after 90 days.)

CONCLUSIONS:
All in all, if you are looking for voice dictation software Dragon offers a reasonable solution for the home or business user. Dragon is still the best--and really only viable--option for home voice dictation that is available; that's why I gave it 4 stars. When it comes to crashes, voice control, and seamless integration with the Mac, however, Nuance still has a ways to go and definitely should have turned out a more polished product. Still, after the last software patch this is definitely an eminently usable product.  Finally, even though Nuance's Dragon still needs a little taming in either the Mac or PC world, it is still a major time saver and, at this time, is really the only available software for voice dictation that is available for the home user.

"I like to work with a fair amount of video. Over the years I've mostly cobbled together various sets of freeware software programs to meet my needs. When I got a chance to try this top-of-the-line Cyberlink suite I thought it be a great opportunity to have all my needs met by a single program. Sadly that wasn't the result.  I'll start off with how installation went.  Feel free to skip ahead if that doesn't interest you.

The suite boasts an impressive number of file formats that it can both import and export. However a huge and glaring omission is real media format. Maybe it's because RealPlayer isn't as big as it used to be, maybe it's a licensing cost issue, but whatever the case this program cannot do ANYTHING with real media files. That right there was a major crimp in what I was getting his program for.  So from the outset, I have to use a separate program to convert too and from that format which somewhat negates having a single suit.  Not the end of the world, but just be advised if your needs are similar to mine.

***Installation***

To give you an idea what to expect, I have a year old computer with a core i7 3.4Ghz, 6 GB RAM, and 750 GB HD so if you're computer is slower some of this may take longer.  The installation is somewhat tedious; there could be a lot of streamlining done.  I started the main suite install at 4:30 PM and it finished at 4:43 PM.  You are treated to a number of different popups including DOS boxes that appear and close; it's just a polish thing but they should have been minimized IMHO.  It also starts a couple of distinct installers including installing a down rev version of QuickTime which has security issues and may leave your system at risk.  I'd suggest you update QuickTime manually immediately after install.  It also installs WaveEditor which can be used to edit sound.

So after this you're done right?  Nope, you still have the bonus content packages on the other CD.  Again, each one has to be installed separately.  I began installing the holdiay, romance, and vacation packs at 4:45 PM and was done by 4:54 PM.  However, each one requires you to fill in your name, company, and the directory.  If you're installing to a custom directory like I was, it's a mild annoyance.  It's also kind of odd it asks for a company as the license terms say it's for personal use only.  So anyway, after all this was done I had two new startup items I didn't want, APSDaemon.exe and QuickTime, set to start at computer boot.  I killed them both with RevoUninstaller (free) and there were no ill effects.

So I was ready to go?  Nope, not yet!  I had to download a 164 MB patch for the program.  Download was no problem.  You also get LabelPrint 2.5 which is an awesome little program to print CD/DVD jewel case labels as well as labels for your disk.  Please DO NOT put paper labels on your discs.  They look nice I know, but if they're not absolutely perfectly centered they can throw off the weight on the CD/DVD and potentially make the disc die sooner.  A marker made specifically made to write on CD/DVDs is the safest way.  LightScribe is probably safe too.  Anyway, it's not on the CDs, that'd be too easy, you instead have to go to the website on the card provided in the box, enter your name, email, and PowerDirector CD code to get to the link to download it and get your activation code.  After that, you can download the software (only about 37.82 MB); so then you have to enter name, company, directory again, and the new code you got for it, THEN IT ASKS YOU TO REGISTER entering your name and email AGAIN.

Finally I could start up PowerDirector.  Guess what?  It asks me to register with my name and email as well.  I'd normally not complain too much about a long install process, and it didn't take that long in terms of minutes, but it was so much less automated than it could have been it was like installing something from a decade ago.  I did however like the use of CD key instead of online activation because I travel.  It seems to be fine if you don't want to register, which is great if you have to install with no Internet connection.

***PowerDirector***

""Internet Connection
  The import/export of some media formats may require activation via an Internet connection. Activation is fast, easy, and free. ""

First off, I mentioned that it seems you can use the software just fine without an Internet connection.  The only caveat, you do need to online register some of the file conversion formats like MPEG-2 (for DVDs) or MP4 files or you're stuck with a 30 day trial.  Activation was instantaneous and worked fine.  Just be aware and open any file types when you have an Internet connection and you should be fine.

When you start the program you're met with a splash screen. I've uploaded a photo of it to the images for this product. Basically it just gives you the option to use a handholding mode instead of the full program if you'd like. Easy mode might not be a bad idea starting out, because the program can be daunting to look at it first.  I'll upload a photo of the Full Feature Editor so you can see it.  You can easily enter Easy mode with a click of the little top hat icon (middle left) from inside the Full Feature Editor.

Importing videos is quite easy and they'll show up in the little library in the upper left-hand corner. Once you've got them there you can perform various actions on. One of the features I liked was the scene detection, however it can sometimes be hit and miss. For example on one episode from a TV show the software detected 105 scenes; on a 3 min. video clip from the web it detected 129 scenes. I loved that I could extract the audio from the clip very easily simply by right clicking it and telling it to extract audio.  Extremely useful if you need to pull your child's singing/piano/etc. out of a video to put alongside other images.

Once you're working with a video you can do a mind boggling number of corrections and tweaks to it.  Some of the features include enhancements, anti-shaking, increased back lighting, and removing noise from video/audio.  You can even flip the video into reverse with a few clicks.  It wasn't hard to split the audio from the video and I was easily able to run a video in reverse with the sound playing forwards.

You also have access to literally dozens of animation overlays (e.g. one adds hearts floating on the screen) that you can add.  Many appear to be from older versions of PowerDirector and duplicate each other.  However, there are enough to play with and the templates even allow for some level of modification themselves.  You also have access to directorZone which says it's free and allows you to download more of them.  I've not had time to try out this feature, but I'll certainly be poking around there later.

The software promises to output to nearly any file type and while technically true it's slightly misleading.  There are a number of devices the program recognizes and can output video to, but don't expect to be able to tweak the formats much; if you have a 2nd or 3rd tier video player that you'd like to convert video for directly the chances are this suite can't do it for you.  There just aren't enough options with respect to aspect ratio, audio bitrate, etc. to be precise enough.  On the up side though, you may be able to convert that stubborn web clip to a format that's close enough your video player's conversion software on your computer will be able to read it and convert to your device.

I don't have a BlueRay burner so that was out, but it had no problems at all with burning normal DVDs.  You can even burn VideoCDs if you have a friend who has an ancient computer without a DVD drive.  As with the rest of the program, there's a multitude of different options to pick including the choice from a couple of dozen menu styles, menu structures, and more.  It may be a bit overwhelming at times, but you can get pretty close to exactly what you want if you tweak enough.

***Other Software***

Label Print 2.5 is a great little piece of software. It not only lets you print the inside and outside covers for your jewel case, but also even a menu for the inside face. This is handy if you're creating some sort of mix CD or a DVD for you on a list out the chapters.

WaveEditor is an audio manipulation program very similar to the excellent free software program called Audacity. I found it extremely intuitive to use and it was able to do some interesting effects on music such as making the room seem wider or deeper. All in all a very cool little program.  It's supposed to be able to export to WAV, MP3, M4A, and WMA, while it worked on 3 of the 4 I couldn't ever get MP3 to export correctly.  I'm hoping that's fixed in a later patch.  Until then you may have to save it as a .wav then convert using another program.  There are a number of free converters out there.

***Conclusions***

I wish I could say this is the end-all suite you would need, but the omission of real media support at least for me hurts it. Cyberlink could improve their installation package to make the process easier and more streamlined, but I do appreciate the fact that I don't have to log into the Internet to validate the copy if I'm on the road (with the exception of 1x for certain file type support) which is a big plus for me.  For the budding armature video enthusiast who takes all the photos at the family events and then sends out DVDs to everybody at the holidays this is an excellent and comprehensive suite.

Just a note, there are some cheaper variations of this software so you may want to look at those if you don't need all the file types and all the bells and whistles.  Though, really you'll probably never regret getting more features than finding out you need something later and don't have it.",4
"It didn't start auspiciously: An annoying and loud video that plays every time you click the Learn tab on the splash screen Guide led me to choose the option not to open the Guide on start up.

If you wanted to visit the online help link, you will quickly find it is just an HTML version of the pdf User Guide, something the User Guide does not tell you as it directs you to open the online help. There's no tutorial for its use that I can see and terminology casually tossed about is not defined (I didn't know what a scrubber was at first.)

The problem is that in a program as complex as a video editor, especially one that is nowhere as intuitive to use as some of its competitors, it is imperative that documentation exists. Clear, and simple documentation. It wouldn't have killed anyone at Corel to create a few tutorials as well.
The Corel Discovery Center on YouTube doesn't really  have anything you can sink your teeth into--out of 101 videos uploaded, only 18 are on video editing and most of those are for past versions of the software. The videos that do exist cover various special effects, nothing basic. If  you want to really learn, it appears you must pay for the privilege.

In addition, since the user base for VideoStudio isn't that large, there are next-to-no videos on YouTube (since that's where Corel decided to store their tutorial videos) like  you do with some other more popular video editing suites such as Sony Vegas. Typing in ""Sony Vegas Tutorial"" into the search bar in YouTube reveals 292,000 results. Typing ""Corel Videostudio Pro X6 tutorial"" shows 7,470 results. The number one hit being a review of the software, not actually a tutorial. Dismal indeed.

If Corel was serious about garnering a larger share of the market, it would ensure that there was an easy way for those using their software to easily learn how it works.

Nevertheless, attempting to wade through the User Guide is practically useless on the first try. Terminology, as I've already said, is introduced willy nilly along with concepts that don't tie into anything a beginner would know about editing video. What is a ""key frame""? How does one go about finding out what it is? No clue. What is the overlay track and how is it different from the video track? No idea.

Even the Getting Started Guide is of no help. The ""Understanding the Workspace"" section is a one-pager with minuscule and quick descriptions of the Capture, Edit (""The editing stage is where you create real magic."" Thanks.) and Share. Quick tutorials covers add on-screen narration, applying a blur with track motion and making 4 HD videos into 1 Ultra HD (4K) Movie. Very helpful in a what's supposed to be a ""Getting Started"" guide.

Not until page 117 of the User Guide do you get to understand what an Overlay is (""... used to overly clips to combine with your video in the Video Track."" Also ""... used to insert video while keeping the audio from the main track ..."") but is then followed by ""... To make overlay clips with transparent background, you can create a 32-bit alpha channel AVI video file ..."" Huh?

I would really like to know how to use VideoStudio Pro X6, but the information I initially have to go on is inadequate. I can see that there are a number of incredibly good-looking things you can do, but I have no idea what I'm doing and the documentation does not help. What little I've been able to do, I've had to figure out myself with a little help from the User Guide and I continue to tutor myself on the finer points of using VideoStudio.

All that carping aside, here are some rather good points for the software starting with an easy installation. I was running the software within 30 minutes and had been able to update it immediately after registration. Since the documentation was useless, I decided to jump right in. Let me take the time to make this observation: making copies of your original video files is recommended because, not knowing what I was doing, I really messed up a few things and had to restore from backup. Also, as the documentation says, it is a good idea to keep your video files on a specific data drive apart from the VideoStudio installed disk. Good advice since video editing can slow things down remarkably and more so when both the data and the software are in the same location.

The sheer amount of stuff that it is possible to do is immense and I think this is one reason I'm sort of flabbergasted there are no good tutorials. There are about 130 different transitions available, 34 different ways to insert a title--and with editing available for those themselves, the options are just about limitless--and 94 Special Effects that can be inserted into a project.

There is a sound mixer that allows finely-grained editing of the video sound, inserting voice-over narration tracks, inserting third-party music and modifying up to 20 overlay tracks, including the ability to change the stereo effects of the sound so as to be left or right channel heavy, if that makes sense. Or you can opt for 'Auto Music', which has a ton of ready made tracks with the proper mood it can insert at your pleasure with subfilters, and even variations. Fantastic.

I haven't played with it, but I've seen the Track Motion feature that allows you to follow an object on screen with a text overlay. It is possible to slow a clip for effect or speed it up. Some of these features are just astounding: it is possible to take a long series of pictures and then combine them together to form a time-lapse movie of those photographs. I mean, there's truly an immense number of things it is possible to achieve. I just wish Corel would do a better job of documenting and teaching.

Bear in mind that the suggested system resource requirements aren't enough, you need quite a bit of computing horsepower to do the majority of this stuff comfortably, or be subject to long pauses and of course, even longer rendering times.

In summary, VideoStudio Pro X6 is feature heavy with high tonnage in features and capabilities and, if you're a beginner, it's going to take quite a bit of time investment to get the job done. But, as I proved to myself, I was able to dive into creating and working with a project then outputting it to a YouTube video with less than an hour's worth of experimentation and about that long of reading the User Guide.

4 stars out of 5 for the software itself, for the very reasonable price (its competitors are quite a bit more expensive), but with one star taken away for the steep learning curve that Corel seems to want you to climb on your own.",4
"This bundle of Quickbooks Pro 2014 with Enhanced Payroll can be a good deal depending on current pricing.  Check the individual product prices to confirm, as pricing changes continuously.  There are several new features in QB 2014 that I think are great (below), and some issues that have been frustrating for years and continue to be so.  This review is of R3.  Subsequent (free) updates of QB Pro 2014 may introduce new features or address some of the issues below.

For new users, there is an improved set-up interface - although, as always, I recommend those not familiar with bookkeeping to consult with someone to help them fine-tune the chart of accounts that will be created for your new company.

Lots of new features that I find really useful.  Because I typically send invoices by email, the new features in 2014 make it worth the cost of the upgrade from 2013 for me.  If you're on 2013 the new features may or may not be worth it for you.  (If you are upgrading from 2012 or earlier, I think the combination of new features in 2013 and 2014 make the upgrade worth it for almost anyone who spends much time each week in Quickbooks.)

When you email a form, such as an Invoice, you can add multiple attachments to it - for example, receipts that support reimbursable expenses.  Emailed forms are logged in the Customer Center for each customer, so you have a record of what you sent and when (although you cannot retrieve the original email content... so best to BCC yourself if you want a full record).

You can now have multiple, customizable email 'boilerplates' for different forms! - customized in Preferences > Send Forms > Company Preferences.  When you go to email an Invoice, e.g., you can select which email content template to use from a drop-down... and can further edit and spellcheck the message right there.

The new Income Tracker is great, providing a clean screen to show unpaid invoices and more.  It provides better information than the old Collections Center and is more convenient than generating an aged receivables report.  This new Income Tracker appears in the entire Quickbooks product line in 2014 - all versions of QB Windows as well as QB Mac and QB Online.  The Windows Income Tracker does NOT show unbilled time and costs, something that QB Mac shows in its Tracker... so you still need to generate a report to see what billables have not yet been invoiced.

The Customer Center now has separate tabs for at-glance-viewing and filtering of customer:  Transactions, Contacts, To Do's, Notes and Sent Emails.

When you attach a file to a transaction, instead of the paper clip just changing colors as in the past, there is a red bubble next to it listing the number of attached files - similar to the bubble listing unread messages in an email program.  This same interface shows up at the top right of the screen by the new Reminder and Alert icons, making it harder to miss reminders/alerts that you created or which are from Intuit (notice of an update, or a payroll deadline, for example).

The new My Company page lists not just your company legal info, but also your product info and a list of all Intuit services to which you're subscribed  - as well as other services that you might want to utilize.  Clicking the icon for your subscribed service (e.g., Payroll, Intuit Payment Network, Credit Card Processing) - takes you to the web page for managing that service.

The new tabbed Employee/Payroll center puts employee information and transactions as well as all payroll processing in one convenient screen.  When in the Payroll Center, you have tabs for Pay Employees, Pay Liabilities and File Forms - cleanly separating those tasks vs earlier versions - but equally useful are the new links at the bottom of each of those screens:  PDF Quick Guides to explain the processes, Other Activities and Reports links that are customized for the particular payroll activity.  Payroll schedules are easily visible and managed to allow regular payroll processing without having to process employees one by one.

Payroll subscription:  The bundled 1 year subscription to Enhanced Payroll supports only 1 employee out of the box.  Additional employees are stated as $2/month.  I've mostly used the cheaper Basic Payroll over the years.  The main difference with Enhanced is that it can (1) electronically pay your payroll taxes, (2) file federal and some state tax forms, and (3) print W-2's that are ready to file.  Without Enhanced payroll, you can pay electronically via EFTPS and your state web payment system - but have to transcribe the numbers and do all of the log-in steps yourself, you can file most forms online including W-2's that can be prepared at the SSS.gov web site - but again, requiring manual transcription.  Enhanced payroll saves these extra, manual steps - and avoid the typos you might make during any of them.  I'm a little confused about the advertised claim that direct deposit is free, as I'm told that it will cost $1.45 per paycheck when I go to the ""Set Up Direct Deposit"" page.

Intuit's requirement that you must phone them to activate your payroll subscription is aggravatingly frustrating and so last-century.  Look, Intuit:  we have a valid license key, we've registered it to our valid Intuit account... let us move on with life without having to be on hold for a human who types in things we could have done ourselves.  Equally aggravating is that Intuit sets your payroll service up for auto-renewal - they do not give you an option to 'opt out'.  I typically buy my annual payroll subscription from Amazon or a big box outlet for half of what Intuit wants to receive for an auto-renewal.  It's a huge waste of cardboard and shipping (overall) as the only thing in the box is a code... which then has to be given to that Intuit service rep on the phone to get another code to actually activate the subscription.  I absolutely loath having to set up or renew payroll with Intuit because of this arcane process.

Glitches that never seem to get fixed still exist.  Quickbooks integrates with Intuit Payment Network to allow you to receive invoice payments by e-check or credit card, but the transaction download process will not let you choose the account used for the fees - instead creating an IPN Fees top-level account and forcing you to edit transactions to put the fees in the account / sub-account that you want them to be in for proper aggregation of banking fees on your income statement.

Address fields in forms are too narrow to display full name and address information - even though there is lots of blank screen space to the right of the fields.  For multicurrency, the currency fields are too small to display the full amounts of low-denomination foreign currencies - although, again, there is plenty of room for them to make the field big enough on-screen.  The Help windows are tiny, un-resizable windows, forcing the user to scroll a great deal and manually close the windows.  Printer Setup for each type of form continues to be in the File menu, as it has been forever ... meaning that when you go to print a pay check, you may have no idea what printer or printer settings will be used and cannot adjust them at the time of printing... but rather have to exit, go back to the File menu to verify or set up printing for that form, and then start over again.

System Requirements:  The product page and box do not include Windows XP SP3... primarily because Microsoft will stop supporting XP early in 2014, but Quickbooks Windows will run on XP SP3, at least today.  The official requirements are for Vista or newer.",4
"UPDATE:  Microsoft has added what they call ""Update for Windows 8.1"", and the tweaks in this update to out-of-the-box Windows 8.1 improve the OS in subtle ways.  Windows 8 users can also upgrade to Windows 8.1.  The free upgrade from 8 to 8.1 is not as obvious as using Windows Update:  instead it is posted in the Microsoft Store and you'll need to launch the Store to get to it.

The bottom line:  Windows 8.1 is a better OS than Windows 8.  When the ""Update for Windows 8.1"" is added, we have an OS that is still a far cry from Windows 7, but turns out to be much more useable than the original Windows 8. The version for this review is the Pro edition, which adds the ability to join and Active Directory domain, use Remote Desktop to access your computer from elsewhere, and BitLocker Drive Encryption.

The full review:  Windows 7 has been a well-received OS, so the case for upgrading to Windows 8 has been difficult for Microsoft to make. I've been using Windows 8 and 8.1 for a while now, and it truly is a mixed bag. The easiest way to explain the difference is to say, ""The Desktop is no longer the center of your work:  it's just another program.  The Start Menu is now full-screen, and you are expected to use it more"".  We have a ""Modern UI"" (formerly called ""Metro"") for the Start Menu that's designed to give you a splash of tiles, each of which represents a program on your machine. When you want to find a specific program or setting, just start typing and the results filter themselves accordingly right before your eyes. In Windows 8.1, the search is much broader and will include results from the web.  This may sound like a shotgun approach when all you want is to find User Accounts or the Disk Defragmenter, but 8.1 does do a good job of organizing your results, and doesn't require you to click/tap through results to drill down to the one you want (which is how it worked in Windows 8).

Icons are now displayed as tiles of varying widths across your field of view in the Start Menu and you scroll left-to-right to look through them. Some of this makes sense in that some of today's programs are more like the Windows Desktop Gadgets we've seen in Vista and 7: rather than needing to be launched, they idly stream information to you, and need a bit more room to be easy to read than the older Start Menu could have allowed for. If you've used Windows Phone, Office 2010, or an XBox 360, you've already been interacting with similar interfaces. This sort of UI has been slowly making its way into Microsoft's products for a while now.

The Windows 8 desktop looks exactly like it did in Windows 7 and Vista, except that the ""Start Button"" now launches the full-screen Start Menu.  The desktop has the tray of running programs you're used to in earlier versions, shows you wallpaper, and offers access to the Windows Explorer for looking through the files on your hard drive. All programs can be launched directly off the tile screen, and while Windows 8 apps always run in full-screen,  Windows 8.1 with Update for Windows 8.1 adds a small bar across the top to let you close it using an `x' button in the upper-right corner, like Windows 7.  Older programs run from within the Desktop and can be resized as always. We have a version of Internet Explorer accessible from the desktop that looks just like IE 9 did in Windows 7, and then we have a version of Internet Explorer in the tile screen that looks entirely different and is a lot more limited. Some parts of the Control Panel have the tile look and feel and the options cascade left-to-right like the Home screen in any MS Office 2010 or 2013 product. Other parts of the Control Panel look exactly like they did in Windows 7 and before. Unfortunately, I haven't found a good pattern for this yet: you may flip from one side to the other in order to do something simple like troubleshoot a network problem.

This is really the heart of Windows 8's problems: its identity crisis. It can be jarring to flip back and forth between Modern and Desktop views, but Microsoft can't let completely go of everything that came before without driving people even crazier, so there will be times you're trying to do a thing and you might be in Modern's full-screen left-to-right only to find yourself dumped into the desktop and shown a dialog box you may remember from earlier versions...and then you need to navigate your way back through Modern to take another step. If you're doing everyday computing, like reading documents or checking mail, you don't run across this too often, but the moment you need to take step outside of the ordinary, good luck figuring out which path you should start from, or which you'll end up on.  Most of the time I have to bring up the Start Menu and search for it by typing the name.

Performance-wise, Windows had been slowly moving away from always-running programs that drain performance to background services that would launch programs as needed...but this too started to get unwieldy. Microsoft have stripped several services out of Windows 8 which by default makes the OS more efficient than 7.  If you put Update for Windows 8.1 on a Windows install, the system requirements go down to 1GB of RAM, but I can't imagine that would be a great experience:  4-8GB seems to be the sweet spot for RAM. Any machine that could run 7 can also run 8. Programs that used to run, shut down, then have to be fully re-launched to run again are instead put in a standby mode so they can launch faster when called again. The Windows Vista and 7 ""Aero effects"" that gave your windows a glassy sheen and rounded corners used graphics and CPU to run, so they've been stripped out of the Modern UI in favor of simple color schemes and blocky edges (though you can still see a subdued glassy effect on the Desktop).

Interaction with Windows in this new look and feel is easier if you have a touchscreen or you're using a tablet, and if you're a Windows Phone user the territory is already pretty familiar. The downside for mouse users is that you occasionally spend time hunting along the edges of the screen for scrollbars and dragging screens around to be able to interact with everything. Sometimes you can use the wheel to scroll and sometimes you can't.

For some features, time will tell. I've found the Modern UI version of the browser to be less compatible and more cranky with websites, and that hasn't changed in the newer versions. I like the fact that security/antivirus are rolled into the OS without me having to take care of them or be interrupted with update notifications but it means my company's older VPN system thinks I don't have any antivirus software and won't let me in without installing a third-party antivirus program.

The OS runs Windows Updates on a schedule that's far less aggressive than previous versions and won't nag you about rebooting when it needs to. I've been told that the performance for gaming is supposed to be greater simply by virtue of a cleaner codebase, but I haven't seen anything substantially different on the PC apart from faster boot-up and shut-down times (I did benchmark my machine with 3DMark11 and, after some adjusting, noticed a slightly higher score). The basic applications like Weather, Photos, Stocks, Mail, and more are very user-friendly, but solely within the context of the new look & feel: expect little familiar ground and a lot of new territory, and the assumption that you should be using a touchscreen.  Applications that borrow from Bing to help you find good recipes, read about health, or set up an exercise program, do a great job of making really easy-to-use, friendly content...and yet they are missing some no-brainer features like the ability to bookmark a favorite item, or share a link to the content with someone else.

If you have a Windows Live account and/or SkyDrive (now called ""OneDrive""), these can integrate fully into the OS: so much so that you would sign in to the computer with your Windows Live/Hotmail account and everything you do would be synced to Microsoft's OneDrive cloud.  On the one hand, it was nice to have my wallpaper and lock screens sync and to be able to easily access documents I use across devices.  On the other hand, I can't seem to stop OneDrive from insisting that Guild Wars 2 needs to be in the cloud, and thus Guild Wars 2 crashes and OneDrive nags me that the game is too big to fit in OneDrive.

Windows 8 has been a love-it-or-hate-it OS for people.  There are a lot of strengths to the OS that are hard to market to people, but unfortunately the weaknesses are all too easy for the average computer user to see.  In the end, the OS is a mixed bag, but 8.1--with ""Update for Windows 8.1"" added--is probably the best version of the OS we'll get.",4
"I've used Norton intermittently since its programs shipped on floppy disk, and worked until they obsolesced or I replaced them with a similar utility or program from another vendor. Thus, you may not share my dislike of the notion of time-limited subscriptions rather than true purchases.

That said, however, Symantec does deserve credit for several aspects of the latest version of Norton 360, and I recommend this suite despite some concerns that are spelled out below. This review is a ""peek under the hood,"" if you will, that avoids the marketing-speak surrounding the product so that you will have an idea of what to expect. I also address installation, since earlier versions caused more than a few users some headaches in terms of installation or modification.

I've put this product through its paces on a MacBook Pro, an older Mac and several mobile devices and have found it less quirky than its predecessors. I also like that it straddles many platforms without the purchase of platform-specific licenses. Before installing, you will want to think about privacy settings or help a young user understand those choices, but otherwise installation and configuration are pretty straightforward. However, I would prefer that it be sold rather than rented, and that product manuals be provided in physical form -- especially for those times when you're troubleshooting an existing problem and Internet accessibility and/or device behavior may be part of the issues with which you're coping.

Positives:
+ The most noteworthy feature of this version of Norton is that it covers your choice of up to five devices -- straddling multiple platforms, rather than past versions, where you'd have to buy two multi-user keys if you wanted to cover both PCs and Macs. Once you've activated your account and registration, you can authorize and deauthorize devices from within a Norton dashboard; this is a more savvy approach than a specific ""install"" quantity that may be problematic if you replace a device. Kindle users, this add/delete function is to device registration you've done when managing your Kindle account.

+ Installation is most easily accomplished online. Take note that one of the two pieces of paper in the product box specifically advises that you install from the Norton website rather than using the enclosed CD if you are working from a PC, a Mac, or a mobile Android or iOS device. (Other verbiage indicates that the CD is for use solely with a PC.)

+ Norton account: If you haven't used Norton or Symantec products in a while, you may need to establish a Norton account, as installation and settings all seem to be controlled when you are logged in. If you move quickly through the account setup, an easy way to find and modify your preferences is to access your newly established account by way of the confirmation e-mail Norton sends. Unless you like receiving offers, during the registration process you will need to opt out of receiving e-mails. Note that Norton groups promotional e-mails with messages about security-related messages so you can't differentiate.

+ This program provides access to a healthy 25 GB of cloud storage. If used with the usual cautions -- such as not storing items of a confidential nature, such as financial material - such storage can be a bonus. However, this really should not be anyone's sole method of backup, especially considering that it is tied to a time-limited subscription.

+ You will be able to establish varying levels of security based on your location and the way you connect to the Internet in these various settings. Although my preference would be to pre-configure rather than deal with making choices on the fly while trying to establish a connection from the road, the process is relatively streamlined.  Look for ""Location Awareness"" in the dashboard; choices are clearly explained.

+ Time from downloading the first small file in the setup process through generating a Norton account with a basic dashboard configuration, downloading the rest of the suite, and being able to conduct your first scan will probably surprise you with its brevity. My time over a relatively slow Ethernet connection was 10:52, and yours may well be quicker, especially if you have more robust connectivity and/or already have a Norton account.

+ Scanning is quicker than I remember with earlier versions of Norton, and runs unobtrusively in the background; it doesn't seem to slow down my work in other programs.

+ The interface guides you into activating various features as you proceed with your daily online activities. When you browse the Internet after activating your subscription, for example, it asks whether you want to activate the Safe Web browsing interface. Similarly, it offers you a chance to configure an interface when visiting Facebook. Especially for younger and/or more trusting users, these features are welcome, although in the case of Facebook, rather than promoting Norton, the default setting should be Facebook's most private custom setting of ""only me"" rather than the default ""public"" setting. (Again, this would be more understandable for freeware or shareware rather than a retail subscription model.)

+ File Guard. This allows you to select files that cannot be opened or modified without your permission, and functions similarly to password-protecting such files as PDFs. This is a positive for those who don't already  have a program that does so, but it requires several clicks to accomplish.

Concerns:
- As noted earlier, I dislike the subscription approach to software and utilities. Norton does seem to respond to folks who feel this way by making it possible to avoid auto-renewal, although it can take some sleuthing to find that setting (the easiest route I found was through the confirmation e-mail).

- The dashboard interface sacrifices transparency for the sake of oversimplification; expect to spend time digging for what you're seeking.

- There's a noticeable amount of in-product upsell, whether for additional cloud storage, additional device licenses, or renewal. I expect this in free or shareware products, and am finding the volume in a paid product to be increasingly intrusive.

- Early in the install process, there's a bit of fine print about the program conducting auto-updates. While that may be a useful default setting for a novice user or someone who prefers not to make these decisions, I dislike enabling anyone's product to write on my drives without telling me what it wants to write -- and why. Note: I haven't found a workaround to this situation, but will update if and when I do. If you have a solution, please share it in the comments.

- Symantec draws on an approach it dubs ""DeepSight"" to gather data on cyber-attackers and updates your application to protect you. That aspect is a positive; however, the program's default configuration is for your devices to ""submit security events"" to Symantec. Although a disclaimer notes that no personally identifying information is included, this setting really should be configured as an opt-in rather than an opt-out.",4
"UPDATE:  Microsoft has added what they call ""Update for Windows 8.1"", and the tweaks in this update to out-of-the-box Windows 8.1 improve the OS in subtle ways.  Windows 8 users can also upgrade to Windows 8.1.  The free upgrade from 8 to 8.1 is not as obvious as using Windows Update:  instead it is posted in the Microsoft Store and you'll need to launch the Store to get to it.

The bottom line:  Windows 8.1 is a better OS than Windows 8.  When the ""Update for Windows 8.1"" is added, we have an OS that is still a far cry from Windows 7, but turns out to be much more useable than the original Windows 8. The version for this review is the standard edition of 8.1; the Pro edition adds the ability to join and Active Directory domain, use Remote Desktop to access your computer from elsewhere, and BitLocker Drive Encryption. These last two items can also be done with third-party software if you prefer.

The full review:  Windows 7 has been a well-received OS, so the case for upgrading to Windows 8 has been difficult for Microsoft to make. I've been using Windows 8 and 8.1 for a while now, and it truly is a mixed bag. The easiest way to explain the difference is to say, ""The Desktop is no longer the center of your work:  it's just another program.  The Start Menu is now full-screen, and you are expected to use it more"".  We have a ""Modern UI"" (formerly called ""Metro"") for the Start Menu that's designed to give you a splash of tiles, each of which represents a program on your machine. When you want to find a specific program or setting, just start typing and the results filter themselves accordingly right before your eyes. In Windows 8.1, the search is much broader and will include results from the web.  This may sound like a shotgun approach when all you want is to find User Accounts or the Disk Defragmenter, but 8.1 does do a good job of organizing your results, and doesn't require you to click/tap through results to drill down to the one you want (which is how it worked in Windows 8).

Icons are now displayed as tiles of varying widths across your field of view in the Start Menu and you scroll left-to-right to look through them. Some of this makes sense in that some of today's programs are more like the Windows Desktop Gadgets we've seen in Vista and 7: rather than needing to be launched, they idly stream information to you, and need a bit more room to be easy to read than the older Start Menu could have allowed for. If you've used Windows Phone, Office 2010, or an XBox 360, you've already been interacting with similar interfaces. This sort of UI has been slowly making its way into Microsoft's products for a while now.

The Windows 8 desktop looks exactly like it did in Windows 7 and Vista, except that the ""Start Button"" now launches the full-screen Start Menu.  The desktop has the tray of running programs you're used to in earlier versions, shows you wallpaper, and offers access to the Windows Explorer for looking through the files on your hard drive. All programs can be launched directly off the tile screen, and while Windows 8 apps always run in full-screen,  Windows 8.1 with Update for Windows 8.1 adds a small bar across the top to let you close it using an `x' button in the upper-right corner, like Windows 7.  Older programs run from within the Desktop and can be resized as always.

"Times have finally changed for Mac users when it comes to dictation on the Mac. It seems that the Mac has always been the Johnny-come-lately to the party as far as dictation was involved. The first time that Mac users could finally say that proper dictation had arrived was when Nuance offered Dragon Dictate for the Mac. Since then Apple finally provided their own version of dictation when they offered up Dictation in the Mountain Lion version of OS X.

Nuance has updated Dragon Dictate for the Mac to version 4. Its taken them 2 years to provide the latest version to Mac users. To use Dragon Dictate 4 for Mac, you have to have an Intel based Mac,  (sorry, no Power PC Macs for those of you still using one) running OS 10.8.3 or 10.9 and a minimum of 4 GB of RAM. Now you don't just sit down and begin to dictate without first teaching Dragon Dictate to learn your individual voice. You do this by providing the software with a sample of your speech so that it learns what your voice sounds like and your way of pronouncing different words. To input your speech, you will need to utilize a USB or Bluetooth microphone, your Macs internal mike  or by using an IOS/Android device using the Dragon Remote Microphone app. For my tests, I utilized the USB microphone VOIP headset with mic that I had on hand.

Setting up Dragon Dictate was not hard, nor was it long and cumbersome. I immediately noticed that it was a lot faster then the previous version, v 2, that I had used. Once I plugged in the USB microphone and selected it, I just followed the directions on installing the downloaded version.  I registered the software as required (more on that later) and followed the instructions on using the microphone. I began creating my voice profile. The Voice Profile itself only took me several minutes to read through the paragraph as provided by the software, providing a sound level and voice training for the system to utilize. As you are reading and the system is learning, the words you have read will then turn green in the dialog box. If you follow the directions, read the paragraph to include punctuation, you should be up and running in short order. Since I am the primary user, my profile was all that I needed.  If other members of your household want to utilize Dragon Dictate after youve installed it and created your profile, they too would need to create a profile. I was also able, as the only user, to install Dragon Dictate on my Macbook Pro and copy my initial voice profile over to the Macbook and begin to utilize the software immediately.

The thing that really makes Dragon Dictate a great product to work with is the ability to verbalize the command to open an application. A good example is the ability while using Dragon Dictate to speak Open Mail and Apples Mail application opens. Nuance has also updated the software to work more closely with Gmail. You can then speak Click Compose and a new message opens, which you can then follow up by speaking your text and end by telling Dragon Dictate to Send Message. I found it much more efficient to say Open Links select the numbered link that I wanted and say Choose link 42 for example to compose and email.  Understand that you will still have to work with the system as Dragon Dictate does not understand a pause within a sentence so you would have to say comma, semi-colon or at the end of the sentence say period. There are still those times that you will still have to work with your hands to move a cursor to where you want it or to open an application, but overall the ability to utilize speech is an absolute pleasure. There were very few apps that I could not open by speaking Open XXXX. The ability to utilize both the application on the Mac and the IOS version, just in case an idea pops into your mind while on the road or not at your desk, makes working on a project or sending an email so much easier.

Dragon Dictate has added a transcription feature, which, if you are the one making notes using a smartphone or a digital audio recorder, will make your life a heck of a lot easier. What you wind up doing is setting up a new profile for transcription in addition to the one youve already created for yourself. Now working with my iPhone, I recorded dictation for the required 90 seconds for training purposes and using Dragon Dictate, it asked if I wanted to open it, I did, and a transcription of what I had read appeared in a dialog box, sans punctuation. Now I sat there and clicked within the text and that area became highlighted and I could either accept it or ignore it. When you do find errors, you just type in the text box and change the text. This also helps train Dragon Dictate to properly handle your transcriptions.

Now I downloaded a My Mac podcast (TechFan 160 as a MP3 file) and because there is music within the opening of the podcast, it was immediately clear that  I would need to make quite a few changes to the text. The other thing that you immediately  notice is that there is no punctuation so you will have to go in and make the necessary tweaks to make it more readable but it does make it easier for the most part than having to sit and type everything.  Of course, having Tim Robertson speak in his normal rate of speech caused a few more corrections to be done. The image below is what originally appeared when I imported it into Dragon Dictate.

Transcription MyMac PodcastI then downloaded an audio clip where the speaker was taking their time, basically reading a prepared speech and there were only a couple of corrections needed. Now before everyone thinks that they can use Dragon Dictate in an environment where there are multiple speakers, that is not going to happen, at least not right now. If Nuance continues to work on and improve Dragon Dictate, that may come to pass.

The more I used Dragon Dictate 4, the more I like it. I was really amazed that there was very few items that caused me any issues other than the fact that when I decided to try out different microphones to assess the flexibility of the program, I did run into a bit of a problem. I thought I would update and purchase a new headset, a Logitech H390, thinking that per information on websites that it was being used by PC users with dictation software it would be fine. I was wrong on that point. It would not work for audio input with Dragon Dictate on either my 2011 Mac Mini or my late 2012 MacBook Pro, both running 10.9.2. I finally settled on using that VOIP USB headset that works perfectly on both units. I did return the Logitech headset. The Nuance website that lists compatible headsets for use with Dragon Dictate is in need of updating as quite a few of the listed items are no longer available and some of the items are by companies that Ive not heard of before.

Is the program 100% accurate all of the time? Honestly, no. There are items that Dragon Dictate does have issues with when you are speaking. I would say treats and got traits; I finally figured out I just needed to take my time and once Dragon Dictate became used to me, the mistakes lessened. Its a learning process for both the user and for the program. If you speak in a normal tone and at a speed that isn't too fast, you should do quite well with the program. The one thing that remained the same from version 2 for me was that I was not able to get Dragon Dictate to properly spell my last name when I dictate something and include my name. Ive followed every recommendation/tip that I could find on how to take care of this; nothing worked. I was finally provided guidance that because of the name, to get Dragon Dictate to properly spell it, I had to train Dragon in a different way than what I had been doing. Rather then Walkowich, I trained Dragon by adding vocabulary and breaking my name down to Walk a witch and combined with the proper spelling of my name, Dragon finally got it correct.

Two things I did learn in using Dragon Dictate is first, you cannot dictate in the address box of Safari or Firefox. Nuance does intend to correct this issue, no time frame given as to when exactly this will occur. Second, if you have ClickToPlugin installed, make sure that when you install Dragon Dictate that you open up the ClickToPlugin extension, click the checkbox to access the settings and make sure that under Plugins, you check the box for the Dragon Dictate Internet Plug-In otherwise Dragon Dictate will not work.

Nuance does provide a web page with information on Dragon Dictate for Mac, that includes a User Manual, demo videos and other information and links. If you have questions or need further information on how to use the application, take the time to check this out. You can also find instructional videos on YouTube on learning Dragon Dictate.

My recommendation for those who may have issues with typing, medical or otherwise, or for someone who does do a lot of typing, is to consider the purchase of Dragon Dictate. The ability to sit at your computer and dictate a document, an email or whatever it is that you wish to do, is a tool really worth considering.

There were a couple of questions that I had in regards to Dragon Dictate that I asked Nuance to respond to if they would. First, why the price disparity between Mac users and Windows/PC users? The Mac price  $180, the Windows/PC price  ranges between $50 and $120, based on the version and where it is purchased.

The response from Nuance was:

Dragon Dictate for Mac, version 4, and Dragon NaturallySpeaking Premium have the same list price of $199. Although they may have slight differences in features due to the different platforms that they run on, they both target the mainstream user. Both Nuance and retailers will often offer sales on Dragon products. Dragon NaturallySpeaking, having a larger user base, does offer a wider selection of versions than Dragon Dictate, with the features and capabilities differing with each version (hence the different price options).

The second question was With the customer/user becoming more aware of their own privacy when dealing with the Internet and companies, the question arises in regards to Nuances privacy policy and its use of customer data. Basically the user is signing away any privacy rights of their own data when they are registering Dragon Dictate. What is Nuances response to those who may be wary of allowing this access and what systems does Nuance have in place to protect the users information? (particularly in light of the hacking of major companies secure systems and the theft of customer information). I asked this question because of Nuances Website or Product Usage blurb when you are registering Dragon Dictate as shown below.

Website or Product Usage

Nuance responded back:

Nuance takes its users privacy very seriously. The primary purpose for collecting user information is assessing the use cases of our products, in the interest of improving our core technology and the individual user experience. The information that people provide as part of their ongoing use of Nuances Dragon desktop products furthers the technologys capability to understand and adapt to a persons unique voice, allowing for a more personalized and effective experience with the product.

Two questions that you need to ask yourself if you are considering purchasing Dragon Dictate for Mac 4. Is the pricing something you can afford and are you comfortable with Nuance having access to your information? The final decision on whether or not to utilize Dragon Dictate is up to you, the consumer. If you are comfortable with both, then enjoy Dragon Dictate.

System Requirements-

Intel based Mac computer (Minimum 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo, Intel Core i3, i5 or i7)

Mac OS 10.8.3 Mountain Lion or 10.9 Mavericks

4 GB of RAM 4 GB of free hard disk space

Microphone- USB or Bluetooth, the internal mike on your Mac, an IOS or Android device running the Dragon Remote Microphone app.

All in all, I give Dragon Dictate for Mac 4, a My Mac rating of 8 out of a possible 10.

"First off, this is NOT a Vine review of a free product. It was purchased.  Just wanted to clarify that since I am a Vine member and there are several reviews through the Vine program.  This is a review of a purchased copy.  I'm not sure why my verified purchase badge isn't appearing but it was purchased from Amazon.  It wouldn't matter if my review had been through Vine because it would be the same regardless, good or bad.  I just want it to be known that I did in fact buy this, especially since my verified purchase check box and tag are missing, likely a glitch due to a Vine member buying an item that was offered free to others through Vine (it wasn't offered to me).

Licensing:
it's about time Norton (and hopefully soon others) finally has realistic licensing. The three-device license is so obsolete it's laughable. If you include portable devices, that barely covers one person who owns a PC, Android phone and Android tablet, let alone an entire household of online users.  The base Norton Security includes licensing for up to five devices.  Norton Security with backup boosts that number up to 10 devices.  For that reason alone, I spent the extra ten bucks. We are a household of six users, a few of whom have multiple PCs. Luckily, we primarily use iOS tablets and smartphones.  So we can use all the licenses on our PCs.  Norton does a terrible job of conveying this info to the consumer and I even inadvertently ordered the base version wondering how I would protect all of our computers. They really need to put this info somewhere prominent, like right in the title like they did with the old three-license software.  The licensing difference isn't  even in the comparison chart between the regular and backup versions. That's why I made it the title of my review.

Registration, downloading and installation:
I was already familiar with the Norton management and their online delivery method because I would use it to download the latest version of Norton products. The site isn't the most intuitive but at least they apparently combined the old Norton accounts with Norton management. The two used to be separate sites. Things are much easier now. Simply go to Norton's web site, create a Norton account and you're ready to go. You then enter the product key for your current Norton license and it will unlock the subscription and add it to your account.  You will see your product along with any devices that currently have the product installed.  To install, simply access the site from each computer you wish to protect.  Log in and download the product. That's it.  The product will automatically activate after installation and you're all set. You can keep track of the installations and remove licenses as needed. Let's say you install it on a computer and the hard drive crashes or the motherboard fails.  You are no longer able to access the installation.  You throw the computer away and buy another.  No worries, simply log into your Norton account from the new computer, remove the old computer from the list of managed devices and it frees up the license for use on another device. Just download it to the new computer and go. As far as Android devices, simply download the app from the Google Play store, enter your Norton account info and it will unlock all the features.

Performance and effectiveness:
I have been using Norton for the past several years and I have to say it is the lightest and best it has ever been. Gone are the days of Norton using tons of system resources and deeply embedding itself within the registry and system files making it virtually impossible to remove.  The new client is small, light and every trace is removed upon uninstall.  If you still need reassurance that every trace is gone, Norton still makes its stand-alone Norton Removal Tool executable available for download. It will scan the system and remove all traces of Norton product. I always run it after a Norton uninstall as kind of a housekeeping step.  As far as protection, I have two teenagers and two college age children. I haven't had to clean a virus in years. We have gotten a warning or two over the years of malware being blocked, but nothing has ever made its home on any of our systems.  I routinely scan with a separate stand alone on-demand scanner or two as a safeguard.  So far, Norton has kept all the nasties at bay.  Speaking of scanning, Norton's scan speed is pretty good. Quick scans take a few minutes at most and full scans are much speedier than in the past, usually completing in 10 minutes or less.  There are other features like Facebook wall scanning and firewall features if you need the extra protection. Facebook links have gotten quite a few of my friends and relatives, usually in the most embarrassing of ways, like posting smut or malicious links to all their friend's walls under their name.  Other tools like a URL scanner (that integrates with your browser and works with most popular search engines), Norton Insight reputation reports,  password manager, and a basic parental monitoring feature can be helpful for those who need them, although I strongly suggest a more robust solution for parental monitoring. I've tried Norton's in the past.  Even their upgraded ""premier"" service left a lot to be desired.  A tech savvy kid could bypass it in minutes.  Some of the tools seem like a throwback to the old Norton Utilities days.  Some basic housekeeping and system monitoring tools like a system profiler, high resource allocation alert, Process manager and others accompany the 25GB of online backup (shared among all ten devices).  As I stated earlier, I bought the Norton with backup for the five extra licenses, not the backup. I have not used, nor do I intend to use, the online backup.  I prefer redundant local disks.  I'm old school.

So, for less than five bucks per device per year, I get Norton quality protection as well as a money-back guarantee if we encounter an infection that Norton cannot remove.  I don't know how Norton plans to honor that obligation (and I'm pretty sure there's likely some fine print hiding in there) but I fully intend to take them on their word if I get one infection that the program alone cannot remove. Much like my auto and homeowner's insurance, I'm hoping I never have to make a claim but it's good to know its there just in case.

Of course, nothing is perfect and Norton Security is not without it's cons which include:

* Inability to upgrade from prior versions - If you use an earlier Norton product and still have time remaining on your license, you can forget about downloading Norton Security and upgrading to the lastest version.  You'll have to finish out your existing subscription for your previous product first.

* Norton Security combines Norton Antivirus, 360 and Internet Security.  Some people preferred the lighter packages of NAV or NIS.  Not everyone wants the extras that were included in the 360 and Internet Security versions of Norton. The new all or nothing model will definitely turn some users off.  Unwanted bloat is just that, regardless of size.

* The new licensing and delivery scheme can be a little confusing if you've never dealt with Norton Management in the past and simply relied on physical installation media along with Liveupdate for all your update needs.

* Renewal rates directly through Symantec are still the software equivalent of paying full sticker price for the product.  As tempting and time-saving as it may seem, it is still more expensive to automatically renew rather than going through retail when your license expires.

* Norton Security for iOS is anything but. It offers zero protection against malware like the current wirelurker threat and the only useful tracking features it does offer are already available (and much more reliably) through iCloud.  That's why I didn't bother to mention it earlier.

* When you get close to renewal, Norton becomes as bad as the adware it fights.  I was in the middle of updating the firmware on a very expensive camera when out of the blue, Norton decided it was time for a random pop-up reminding me to renew.  I HATE nonsense like that.  If it must force annoying marketing tactics on me, at least set it to do so upon boot only and not completely random when something that could potentially be ruined is running.  As luck would have it, the auto-focus on this VERY expensive camera seems a little sluggish after the update.  Since I don't know if the culprit is a bad update file or Norton's adware popping up in the middle of the update, I'm now forced to uninstall and reinstall the update to be 100% sure.  To make sure Norton's adware doesn't zing me again, I'll use my Mac for the update next time.",4
"Microsoft Office is one of those ubiquitous apps that most computer users will run into at some point, and many people (too many people?) spend the majority of their professional lives in front of one of the apps in this package. I know - I've been living with Office since before it was called Office, and one form or another is installed on my Macs, my Windows PCs - even my iPad.

Microsoft's business - like many software companies - requires the recurring revenue of an ongoing series of upgrades and enhancements. Problem is, at least a decade ago, the Microsoft Office apps became good enough that Microsoft started running out of new feature ideas most people would see as valuable. I use Word a lot, and I doubt I make use of more than 20% of what it's capable of. And at the same time, if Microsoft were to create a truly revolutionary new Office product, the tens of millions that are comfortable with today's products would need retraining. So Microsoft is stuck between these extremes...on one hand, the current products are probably more capable than most people can use, and on the other hand, you need to evolve but not change too much lest you alienate today's customers. This makes any upgrade tricky.

Okay, with that background in place, here are my impressions of Office 2016 for Mac...

First of all, I want to be clear that I am *NOT* reviewing a free copy. Where you see ""Vine Customer Review of Free Product"", I'm actually reviewing Office 2016 Home and Business that I purchased separately (indeed, due to some sort of error, I never received my keycard from Vine). I don't believe there's any difference in the software - no matter how you get it, the apps are the same.

That out of the way, one of the first things the typical user will want to consider is exactly what Office apps you need and whether to buy an individual license, or whether to pay for an Office 365 subscription. To me, it's usually a no-brainer: choose the Office 365 subscription. It gets you up to five copies of Office on your choice of Windows or Mac PCs, or tablets and portable devices, as well as future upgrades at no extra charge. To me, this sounds like a more cost efficient way to get Office, especially if you have more than one computer (say, a Mac and a Windows PC, or an iPad).

And speaking of the iPad, one of the things I like best about the newest release is that the big Office apps run really, really well on an iPad these days. Unlike older releases where Microsoft pretty much just provided a viewer for the various Office document formats, the current release is nearly as powerful as either the Windows or Mac versions. If you're one of those who spend your life in front of the various Office products, you can now realistically think about replacing your PC/Mac with a tablet and not surrendering any major functionality. Of course, you can take advantage of the mobile versions of Office without necessarily needing to upgrade your PC or your Mac, but if you find yourself using the latest versions on your iPad, you might want the most similar things on your Mac.

Back to Office, I would agree with many of the reviewers who suggest that there's generally not a hugely compelling reason to upgrade from Office 2011, with these exceptions:

1. On more modern Macs, the new Office seems to run faster and take better advantage of multi-core processors. On my recent MacBook Pro (with the quad-core i7 and 16GB of memory), Word, PowerPoint and Excel are notably faster and more stable than the prior release. The opposite is true on an older iMac I have - there, Office 2011 seems to run notably better.

2. If you use both Windows and Mac a lot, I find Office 2016 to be an easier transition across the two platforms, especially if your flavor of Windows is Windows 10. I share documents across the iPad version of Office, Windows 10 and my Mac, and for whatever reason, with Office 2016, I spend a lot less time thinking about the odd little platform-specific ways to get things done.

3. If you must use Outlook for email, the version on Office 2016 is about as good as it gets. It's not always easy to integrate outside mail accounts (gmail, for instance requires you to setup a totally different ""app password"" for Outlook), but once you do this, it's quite good. If you're at a corporation that requires Outlook as an email client for getting to the company Exchange server, finally you don't feel handicapped by Outlook. Of course, things like preferences in email clients are highly subjective, but I'm finally to the point where I'd rather use Outlook than browser based email or Apple's built-in email client.

4. The Office 2016 version of PowerPoint seems less buggy and more stable overall. For example, I have presentations I save in PDF format in Office 2011 that just come out corrupt - wrong fonts, wrong layout, etc. With Office 2016, these are perfect so far.

There are some limitations in Office 2016. For me, one of the big ones was using Word to generate form letters via an ODBC database connection to a MySQL database. This didn't work great in Office 2011 (indeed - it's one of the reasons I keep a Windows PC around!), but it doesn't work AT ALL on Word 2016. I suspect the issue is compatibility problems with the underlying database drivers, but this ""just worked"" in prior releases.

Also, one example of an annoying ""feature"" is that there seems to be an odd interaction between Word and Apple's Time Machine in this release. Every 10-15 minutes, Word comes to a standstill while Time Machine runs. In fairness Microsoft has a few articles on how to prevent exactly this problem, and I'm sure it's just something like a temporary file being locked by Time Machine while Word is trying to use it, but I very rarely see this sort of thing in other Mac applications - not even in Office 2011.

There are tons of other enhancements, but these were the big ones for me. The rest seem to fall into categories of ""oh, isn't that cute"" to truly useful to completely annoying. The good news is that if you must, you can have both Office 2011 and 2016 installed at the same time, which is how I'd recommend you make the transition - at least initially.

Bottom line is that I believe Microsoft has made good progress on bringing all the Office platforms together, and so if you find yourself using Office on all sorts of different computers, then upgrading to Office 2016 on your Mac will be a good idea. If this isn't you, and you're totally happy with Office 2011 (or whatever prior release), then I'm not sure you'll see any drastic differences by upgrading. There's risk to upgrading - and risk to not upgrading - so this gets to be a personal decision that will depend on your preferences and requirements.",4
"There is a feature option in this version that is new to me.  After installation, you are asked if you want to enter the PC version or the Television version without any explanation of what each offers.  I chose the TV mode and right away I didn't like the menu structure.  For some very weird reason, the title bar at the bottom is very wide and actually covers up a big portion of the movie menu such as subtitles.  You just cannot select the subtitles on most movies I have watched so far.  It almost seems like PowerDVD has dropped back to VGA resolution on my 65 inch Panasonic HDTV. And I cannot seem to shrink that ultra wide black bar at the bottom that has the play, stop, pause, etc symbols.  On some movies I've seen so far, I can use that big black menu to select the subtitles, but most often not. I just cannot imagine why they created such a huge black menu bar at the bottom of the screen.  Now the black bar goes away after you start watching the move.  I have had cases where I got stuck in a menu loop and had to start the movie from the beginning.  So I thought maybe it was unique to the computer I had connected to the Panasonic HDTV.

So I installed PowerDVD 16 on my best computer that has a new $475 NVidia card inside and it is connected to an $800 40 inch UHD computer monitor. But this time I selected the PC mode and the menu bar at the bottom was acceptable. Then I switched to the TV mode and there was that broad black line again. It was a little more narrow than on my 65 inch Pansonic HDTV, but not by much.  I still had the same issues trying to activate the menu in the bottom on the Movie menu image - that is selecting the language and subtitles.

I don't know what Cyberlink was thinking to create this monstrous thick black title bar that covers up the bottom part of the movie startup menu. I have almost every release of PowerDVD there is and this is the first time I've ever seen anything like this.  I will have to uninstall version 16 and go back to version 15.  I hope they come out with a new tweak to fix the huge black bar at the bottom of the screen or at least give me the option of selecting how big it is.

Back to the PC and TV modes for a moment, they offer some imaging enhancement that is supposed to allow the viewer to view in original content, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% enhancement.  I tried to see the difference between these five settings and neither my wife nor I could detect even the slightest difference in any of these optional settings.  It wasn't until I installed this new release on my computer with a UHD monitor and even then it was subtle. Basically, it gives you the choice of several levels of sharpness.  So setting it to 0% (original) just passes the video as it was recorded. If you skip to the end of the movie when the credits start to scroll, you can finally see a little difference between 0% and 100%. The lettering is a little more crisp when at the 100% setting. At the lower settings, the lettering looks slightly soft or very slightly blurring or maybe out of focus for lack of more descriptive terms. But when watching the movie, I just couldn't notice the difference even on the $800 40 inch UHD monitor and $375 NVidia video card. My wife has 20/15 vision courtesy of Lasik surgery and she couldn't see any difference either except for the rolling credits at the end of the movie. Her eyesight is near perfect and much better than mine.  So yes, it makes the image a little crisper on a UHD television, but don't expect miracles.

The second option has to do with audio quality and has the same range of 0% to 100% enhancement. I have a very high quality Klipsch 7.1 sound system and I really enjoy it.  But here again, neither my 27 year old wife nor I could detect any difference in sound enhancement. She can hear far better than I can. There's probably some improvement, but without the ability to instantly switch between two entirely different sound systems in an AB comparison, I don't think it is possible to hear any difference no matter how good your hearing is.

Now I don't want to be seen as overly critical. Thats not my intent.  Just moderate your expectations and don't expect miraculous improvements in the video and sound quality. There are definitely some video improvements  just subtle.  Obviously any enhancements are welcome. I it isn't a simple task to make these video adjustments in real time. And you cant create something out of nothing.

I just recently upgraded to Windows 10 and from what I can determine, Microsoft didn't include any video players in the operating system.  So it appears you will have to purchase an application like PowerDVD if you plan to watch movies via your computer.  There are some fairly good free movie players and I have used two of these apps. One is called VLC and another one is called MPC-HC.  VLC is fairly popular, but I think MPC-HC is a little better, but not huge amount. If you just want a casual computer based movie player, the free players are not bad  pretty good in fact.  You won't get a lot of frills, but they certainly do the job. There were a couple of instances where I couldn't get PowerDVD to play a movie ripped to my hard drive.  PowerDVD is apparently a lot more legal than some players when it comes to hard drive copies of movies.  I have a large collection of legal DVDs and Blu-ray movies in ISO format backed up on several high capacity disks.

That reminds me of a new feature on this release of PowerDVD  it will now play a ISO movie file.  But it takes it quite a lot of time to buffer the movie in memory before you are able to play the movie.  If you use the free app called Virtual CloneDrive to play the ISO image with PowerDVD, it loads far faster than PowerDVD. So I still have to mount the movies ISO file using Virtual Clone.  And that will automatically invoke PowerDVD to play the movie file.  It is a little annoying to unmount a movie file, but it will release the movie when you select the next movie you want to watch.  You can find the free Virtual Clone Drive app at the RedFox website along with some other interesting apps. It used to be called SlySoft, but recently Slysoft mysteriously vanished overnight. Dont download any recent updates to the Slysoft apps if you purchased a license or youll have to pay for it again.

My wife is not a native English speaker, so it helps her to see what is being said. And a lot of times, the sound recordings in movies is virtually inaudible and impossible to understand what the actors are saying. So even though the subtitles are annoying, I place more value on knowing what the actors are saying.

If you don't think my review is useful, tell me the reason why in the comments so I can improve my review writing skills.",4
"This is a tough product to review. On one hand, WordPerfect Office offers a powerful and very capable alternative to Microsoft Office. As multiple reviewers have already noted, if you really care about a document's layout the ""Alt + F3"" ""Reveal Codes"" feature is pretty much worth the cost of the purchase.

But the X8 version is not really all that different from the last version I used (X4). And what new features have been added pretty much apply to the Standard or Professional version of WPOX8 and not this one (Home & Student). At this point, I have to add that the ""Home and Student"" edition reviewed here is NOT the same as WPOX8 Academic (more on that in a bit).

So what does one get for $99 (Amazon price at the time of this review)? You get the essentials and they are: the WordPerfect document processor (equivalent to MS Word), Quattro Pro spreadsheet (equivalent to MS Excel), Presentations (equivalent to MS PowerPoint), Lightning (equivalent to MS OneNote), and the AfterShot 2 photo processing app. That's it, but that's probably enough for most folks. (Interestingly, Corel offers a stripped down version of this product -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-Office-5-3-Installs/dp/B006N1Q0W2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel Office 5 - 3 Installs</a>&nbsp;(essentially, the Corel version of MS Works) - and I can't help but wonder if, at $30, Corel is hurting WPO sales by offering Office (though I suspect Corel hopes Office will be a stepping stone to WPO)).

For me, the sweet spot (as it pertains to features is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-WordPerfect-Office-X8-Standard/dp/B01EB06R10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel WordPerfect Office X8 Standard</a>. But for some reason Corel puts it out of reach by pricing it at $250. I guess there must be some logic, but I'm not following. If you can qualify for the Academic Edition that's the way to go. For $80 you get WPOX8 Professional (which adds the Paradox database application) for less than this Home & Student Edition. Disappointingly, the Perfect Authority ""table of authorities"" feature is an add-on (at $199) for the Standard and Professional versions; perhaps even more disappointingly, Perfect Authority won't work with this (Home & Student) edition.

If Corel really wants to keep a foothold with the ""next gen"" of users it HAS to update the interface; the software still looks like it did a decade (or more) ago. Frankly, this looked good when WFWG 3.11 was the current OS (and that was 1993)! What with folks moving away from WPO years ago and now folks moving away from the desktop/laptop entirely, Corel has got to do something to refresh the look. Even the free, Open Source LibreOffice has updated its look. It amazes me is that it's the cheaper, less capable product - Corel Office - that uses a MS Word ribbon interface that is far more modern and user-friendly (to the eyes) than WPOX8. So if Corel believes WPO can survive because lawyers still like the pleading and authorities features, okay. But I think it is ultimately a losing strategy.

WordPerfect, despite its looks, is - I believe - a superior product to MS Word (if it matters to you what your document looks like behind the scenes). I have used both since the late 1980s and know that you can do more with the former than latter. Quattro Pro is equally as capable as Excel at most basic tasks, but the world is Excel-based (so most work in QP will have to be ""translated"" for use in Excel). Finally, I think Presentations is a better presenting app than PowerPoint, but once again, the world is PowerPoint-centric. Of the three, the least difficult to transition output over to an MS Office-centric world is WordPerfect (which is fortunate as WP is the reason I think most people buy this suite). Even if this is the case, don't discount the other two: I learned spreadsheets on QP and found it a bit easier to understand the concept of spreadsheets on QP than I did on Excel; same with Presentations (easier to use initially; which is kind of a hoot considering WP's long-standing reputation of having a steep learning curve!).

After Shot 2 is a full version photo editing/adjusting application. I don't do a whole lot of work with photos so my impressions are those of an amateur. But from all appearances it appears to be a comprehensive, full-featured app. It is, however, 1 version behind; the most current version is 3.x (which you will learn about when closing version 2 and being shown an offer to upgrade to version 3 for $49.

One last thought. Usually ""user help"" is an after-thought; the mind set these days seems to be that if you can't figure it out, do an internet search or buy an after-market book. It's pleasing to see Corel not going that route; the Corel Reference Center utility is superb.

Summary: 4 stars. Functional, powerful, capable, at $99 you get a great program at a reasonable price and one that doesn't require an email account to activate and keep active. A 5-star bit of software. But it looks so, so, so old; WPO is in drastic need of a facelift. And the features added to make WPOX8 better than previous offerings is slim. The old look and minimal reasons to upgrade earn -1 star. So while I really want to support Corel's latest edition of WPO, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that I think the optimal way to go (if you can't get the Academic version) is either to buy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WordPerfect-Office-X7-Standard/dp/B00JC5Y6WM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WordPerfect Office X7 Standard</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-Wordperfect-Office-X7-Home-Student-Product-Key-Card/dp/B00YYCI98K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel Wordperfect Office X7 Home & Student - Product Key Card</a>. At $140 you get a more powerful suite in WPOX7 Standard than WPOX8 H&S and don't really miss anything for $40 more than WPOX8 H&S. If one decides to go the H&S route, WPOX7 Home & Student comes in at $40 and is essentially identical to WPOX8 H&S (but less than half the cost). Like I said, not sure I'm following Corel's pricing strategies; to me, Corel has to do something if it wants WPO to remain a viable product. Anyway, take a look at the attached comparisons downloaded from Corel's WP web page...(couldn't post .pdf files so screenshots will have to suffice; I also posted a screenshot of this review in progress so you can get a glimpse of the interface).",4

Installation is as easy as following on-screen prompts and there are online installation tips and how-to's for server installation.

I am a former Peachtree user, so a lot of Sage 50's features are familiar.  I would personally be OK with the Pro version as I don't use many of the features of Premium, nor do I really need a 3-user license scheme.

One thing that would be nice to include with this is Payroll but this has to be added at an additional cost.
Note that built in support and product updates are only good for 365 days.

Overall - I don't like subscription schemes but I do think this is powerful and well-designed software.",4
"Pinnacle seems to have more cushioning so my husband likes them better. He's tried all the other Powerstep inserts as well as other brands. This is his must have insert. He is 6'3"" and weighs 257lbs with bone spurs (plantar fasciitis) and a high instep. He is very active and wears these in all his shoes. His bone spurs rarely bother him any more. Remember to replace them every 3 months if you wear them every day, especially if you weigh more than average and/or run.",5
"WOW!  I love these capris!  I ordered the deep teal and they are a very dark blue/teal (a much deeper prettier color than shown).  I received many compliments the first time I wore them to the gym.  They are super soft and comfortable from the leg all the way to the waist...COMFORTABLE.  They never slip down at the waist and give me full coverage (not see through at all). I am 5' 4"" and 159 pounds and I ordered a medium.  The size fit perfectly although that being said they are longer on me than the photo (probably my short legs) but came 2 inches above my ankle so just below my calf.  Given that I have weight to loose these are very flattering on as well.  They are also a nice stretchy fabric (thus the comfort) and cool.  We are in the high 90's and 100 degree summer weather and I am cool!  Purchase these as you won't be disappointed especially at this price.  I like these better than my Lululemon and Athleta capris!!!  I am back to purchase more!",5
Beautiful mirror finish-very comfortable. Looks great with my white gold engagement ring and you cant beat the price. I have another band like this in a different size that Ive had for 2 years and the finish is still beautiful with no scratches. If you want a beautiful ring at a great price I highly recommend the white tungsten carbide!!,5
My ring shipped the same day that I placed the order and was received well before the estimated delivery date. It is absolutely beautiful!! It is a substantial ring without being overly heavy and is very comfortable to wear. I've cooked and cleaned with it on and it is still free of scratches and the finish is beautifully shiny. It also runs true to size. I highly recommend this ring and this seller!! Will definitely do business with them again.,5
"Tried them on in a store before buying online so I knew they'd fit good. Overall I was looking for a durable cross training shoe that would hold up to my rigorous training and these have been great so far. They are really light and comfortable. Most importantly for me they have grips on the bottoms so my feet don't slide out from under me while doing planks, push-ups, etc. Highly satisfied with this purchase.",5
"Great shoe. I've had Nike's before and have always been pleased with the comfort, performance, and quality. Though I will say this was the first time I ordered a pair online without trying them on first, so I was nervous. But this turned out to be a great choice. Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration. Everyone is different in their preference for cushioning, but I think for light runs on a treadmill they would be sufficient. Love these, highly recommend!",5
"Straight out of the box, these shoes are great! Very lightweight and fits comfortably on my feet like a glove! I love most especially that the sole is not bulky like my previous running shoes  I hated those things lol! I would give them a shot and they are great for the price!",5
I love the shoe and it fit as expected the photos and description are accurate if you're looking for a shoe that has more cushion or support try a different style but as far as wanting a lightweight and breathable shoe this is it. I am very satisfied with this purchase,5
Glad I read the reviews and ordered a half size too big. These are light weight. I worked out in them last night and had a great work out. They are very comfortable. I would recommend these to anyone. I am a Beach Body Coach and these are now my new favorite shoes to work out in. I feel like I am walking in slippers when I wear these shoes. They are so comfortable. I LOVE them so much. I never buy myself anything nice and for Christmas got an Amazon gift card and used it to buy myself these sneakers and they are so awesome. I really do love them and have been telling all my friends about them. GET THESE SHOES!,5
"I love these, I had the previous iteration (or maybe two earlier?) and finally wore them out after several years. They are definitely a light-weight training shoe so I wouldn't get them if you are going to be doing a lot of running. But this also makes them extremely comfortable, I hadn't realized how hot running shoes made my feet until I switched to these. Good support and my feet stay cool all day, also noticeably light but well-made and long lasting.

I have worn them hiking in a pinch but don't really recommend it because the material is mesh-like and will let a lot of dirt in. But if you mainly take cardio classes and/or do weight training or just need something to wear around town look no further.",5
"Super light-weight, decent arch support (mine is higher than average).  I was pleasantly surprised by the sole/tread on these for my circuit training classes, as I couldn't really tell by online pics.  Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their ""Hurache's""/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic, heel, boot).  But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less, I don't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc.).  Shoes arrived with an odd yellowish color on side of one shoe, but no damage to box, paper lining etc - I was happy that a clorox wipe easily cleaned the shoe and did not discolor any further.  I am very happy and highly recommend, although I have only worked out it once!",5
"My wife loves these shoes. We have both been wearing sketchers and new balance for several years and recently we have both purchased Nike. There is a reason why Nike is still number 1 after all these years, you just cant beat their comfort.",5
"Great shoe! Outside arch is kind of high, but I'm still breaking them in. So I'm sure that will work it's way out. I originally ordered a 9, my regular size, and it was a tad too big. Returned and ordered an 8.5 and it fits perfect!",5
"My favorite running shoes!  The wall of the shoe is very thin, which makes them very comfortable to wear if your feet swell as you run.  I would not recommend for use on concrete or a treadmill, as there isn't very much impact absorption, but they are perfect for trail running!",5
"I have pretty high arches and my calves always hurt at the gym with other shoes. I have been on the hunt for a good cross trainer that I can use to lift, take gym classes, and lightly jog/run on the treadmill. These have been wonderful! I don't ever have any pain in my calves or my feet when wearing these and they fit like a glove. Highly recommend!",5
"Obsessed with these shoes! I was looking for good all around sneakers (running, walking, tennis, etc.) and these more than fit the bill. I was looking specifically for black nikes (I love the fit) with white soles (good for court sports); I was a little reluctant to purchase because I wasn't sure whether the black on the soles would contact the ground, but it doesn't!",5
"I love these shoes so much that  I reordered another pair online. It's hard to find shoes that fit my really wide feet! The heel back is my favorite part on them, they're thin and feel like another layer of skin, not bulky or tight at all.  I walked all over Europe in these!",5
"Love them absolutely comfortable. I'm very picky with sneakers and this ones for the price are great I use them for cross fit , boot camp & they work great . The sole is very flexible , true size . I have a wide feet and they fit perfectly. Very nice looking Great sneakers.",5
"I love these shoes my second pair of 40 plus $ shoes and they both have certainly out done the $100 K-swiss that I'm looking to return . The shoes are extremely comfortable, all my clients love them, just wish they came in more colors.",5
"There is about a 1/2 inch of extra space from the tip of my big toe to the front of the shoe. That's okay, though. I usually wear socks, so it doesn't feel too big, even if it does make your foot look a bit long.

The colors are vibrant, and the sole has plenty of grip, even on a slippery floor. I wore them for most of the day and they are comfortable.

Overall, I'm very pleased with this shoe.",5
I have gotten so many compliments on the blue color and look of this shoe.  It is super comfortable.  The grip is wonderful for my indoor gym cross training classes.  I always order a half size larger in Nike brand shoes and thy fit perfectly as I did with this shoe.,5
It's hard to find a lightweight athletic shoe with a wide toe box. This shoe has that. I am happy with the support for walking and everyday wear. I wouldn't run in them. Now I just have to stock up on as many pair as I can afford before Nike discontinues them :). Don't you hate when that happens?,5
"Great shoes - was looking for something to replace my barefeet so I can wear orthotics while kickboxing. These are light weight, hug my feet comfortably and have a thinner upper so I can still feel the bag when I kick AND they have good lateral stability. My feet are on the narrow side so it's hard to find shoes that are snug enough. These are perfect. Oh, and they are really cute too.",5
"If you wear Nike on the regular, then you should pretty much know your size. I wear only 7's in Nike, and it fit just as expected. I have many of the trail runner generations, and love them all. they're my go to sneakers for the gym use, or casual wear. I have a pair I used mostly for casual wear that have lasted about 5 years. Another pair that I used for cross fit/outdoor runs that lasted a little over a year (very vigorous daily use). All in all, these shoes are great for me. They're lightweight, and comfortable.",5
"I actually have 3 pairs of these trainers.  They are very comfortable, there is a neoprene sleeve that goes around your ankle that makes them the most comfortable for me compared to normal athletic shoes.  They run a little narrow - for me this is perfect, but you may want to round up on the size or try on in the store first if your feet are on the wider side.",5
"Love these shoes, I have worn them all day and found them really comfortable with no aching feet at the end of the day. Fantastic colour and true to size. I also bought  Nike Women's Flex Supreme Tr 3 Pnk Pw/Mtllc Slvr/Cl Gry/White Training Shoe and these shoes are slightly more comfortable than those even though they look very similar.",5
These are as far as comfort goes the most comfortable pair of sneakers I have I suffer from sciatica pain that goes into my feet I have difficulty finding the proper support and comfort in shoes I would recommend these most definitely.,5
"Favorite training and walking-around sneakers.
They look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
With the exception of running (for which I use proper Mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
However, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. This is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",5
"Love these! I have 3 pairs...they're so comfortable - I'm on my feet all day & my feet actually don't hurt at the end of the day when I wear these :)
I've learned to get these 1/2 size smaller....I'm normally a size 7 and the 6 1/2 fit perfectly",5
"I bought a wide size of these at a local store and they are amazing!  Soft, comfy, with moderate support.  Not a cloud to walk on, but not minimalist.  The wide size is perfect for my wide feet with high arches.  The shoe tends to run about a half size long though, especially for Nike.  I am working on getting in shape, and these shoes feel good all day... No rubbing on my big toe joint or pinkie toe or heel.  Very pleased.",5
I bought these for my wife. She saw them in the store but did not have their size so i ordered on amazon. She loves them . She already had for a couple of months and no complains at all. One of her favorites shoes for running or for her job since she walks a lot in the warehouse. Now she loves me more. :),5
Love my new Nike's.  It's been years since I've been able to wear them (sizing changed years ago and I just couldn't wear them any more) but now the new styles and sizing are perfect.  Lightweight shoe with tons of style.  The Fog color is just what I was looking for...not black and not neon!  I wore them to participate in Relay for Life (24 hour walk) and they held up great!,5
"I am so happy with this purchase. I feel like I'm barely wearing a sneaker when working out. Another plus is that when I take off my sneaker, my sock is barely sweaty! I have never had that experience with a shoe. The shoe is also very attractive and flattering and looks nice on my feet.",5
"Wore these for the first time hiking the bluffs. Not the best traction on well worn rocks, but super comfy. No blisters, no achilles pain like with other shoes. Will continue to purchase Nike shoes, because my feet love them for all activities! ( except my home workouts, they drag pretty hard on the carpet)",5
"A-MA-ZING!  I needed a good jogging shoe and these make me feel like ""Forest Gump"".  I felt like I was running on a cloud.  I have narrow feet and these fit perfectly.  I am so happy that I am going to purchase another two pair as back-ups for once it's time to replace them.  Highly recommend to women who like to walk or run and light a light weight, comfortable shoe.",5
"These shoes are awesome!  They are nearly weightless and feel great on my feet.  The first day I wore them I wore them ALL day on vacation.  I put them on the next day and did the same.  Besides the comfort, they are really a cool color!",5
"This is the most comfortable shoe I've ever had. No other shoe can compare to how the individual nubs on the bottom allow your foot to be cushioned, yet work like it's suppose to. My feet feel cradled in this shoe and hard surfaces don't make my feet ache anymore.

These shoes have a small amount of support, but not much, which I like as I'm coming from vibram five fingers. (Sorry vffs, I'm bailing after 2 years of shin splints, no matter what I did).

Highly recommended for walking/running on concrete or tracks. As long as nike continues to make the flex supreme, they will get my money. Please don't change this shoe!",5
"These run large. I wear a 9.5 exactly in every shoe, but these I bought a 9, and the toe area is pretty wide plus plenty long even with socks. Very comfy and very nice looking shoe. I love them but glad I was able to try them on before purchasing.",5
"I've had these shoes for about a week now and have so far enjoyed using them. Considering the fact that I have wide feet, the shoes are slightly tight. However, it doesn't feel uncomfortable nor does it bothers me as I use them throughout my workouts. I know some people personally like when the shoes are a bit tighter or a bit looser so it's all in personal preference.",5
"Super comfortable and fit my small feet perfectly. I have flat feet so a lot of shoes are not comfortable for long periods of time. I can wear the shoe all day long and they are super comfortable. They are light colored so any dirt will be seen right away, but they are easy to clean compared to other shoes Ive had. Would definitely buy another pair in a different color.",5
I absolutely LOVE these shoes. These are my absolute favorite. So light and comfortable. These are actually my 2nd pair. I am still wearing my 1st pair after 2 years and they look good still. I am just afraid they are going to disappear and I want a back up pair for when my 1st pair wears out. These have been the best shoes I've owned!,5
Favorite Nike shoe ever! The flex sole is excellent for someone like me who loves the free feeling of sandals or being barefoot. These move effortlessly with the bend of my foot. I've worn these for multiple activities and I've had no foot or ankle pain. The white/green/dark grey color goes with so many outfits and the mesh breathes perfectly on hot summer days. Highly recommend!,5

"The Encyclopedia Britannica 2011 Ultimate Edition (formerly ""Student and Home Edition"") builds on the success of its completely revamped previous editions in 2006-10. The rate of innovation in the last five versions was impressive and welcome. It continues apace in this rendition with Britannica Biographies (Great Minds, Heroes and Villains, and Leaders), Classical Music (500 audio files arranged by composer), and a great Workspace for Project Management (a kind of friendly digital den). Six months of free access to the myriad riches of the Britannica Online complete the package (as well as monthly updates and discounts on a plethora of products).

The Britannica comes bundled with an atlas (close to 1800 maps linked to articles and 287 World Data Profiles of individual countries and territories); the Merriam-Webster Dictionary and Thesaurus, augmented by a Spanish-English translation dictionary; classic articles from previous editions; thirteen yearbooks (12,200 articles in total); Interactive Timelines with 4000+ indexed timeline entries; a Research Organizer; and a Knowledge Navigator (called The Brain or BrainStormer). All told, it offers a directory of more than 166,000 reviewed and vetted links to online content.

In its new form the Britannica is user-friendly, with an A to Z Quick Search feature. The Britannica's newest interface is even more intuitive and uncluttered than previously and is great fun to use. It offers morsels of knowledge, some of it date-specific, appetizingly presented through a ticker tape of visuals that leisurely scrolls across the bottom of the screen plus highly edifying interactive tours of articles and attendant media.

When you enter even the first few letters of a term in the search box, it offers various options and is persistent: no need to click on the toolbar's ""search"" button every time you want to find something in this vast storehouse of knowledge. Moreover, the user can save search results onto handy ""Virtual Notecards"". Whole articles can be copied onto the seemingly inexhaustible Workspace.

The new Britannica's display is tab-based, avoiding the erstwhile confusing proliferation of windows with every move. Most importantly, articles appear in full, not in sections. This major improvement facilitates the finding of relevant keywords in and the printing of entire texts. These are only a few of the numerous alterations and enhancements.

Perhaps the most refreshing change is the Britannica's Update Center. Dozens of monthly updates and new, timely articles are made available online (subject to free registration). A special button alerts the user when an entry in the base product has been updated.

Regrettably, the updates are not incorporated into the vast encyclopedia and its search interface: they are out there on a website. Moreover, the product does not alert its user to the existence of completely new articles, only to updated ones. It takes a manual scan of the monthly lists to reveal newly added content.

Speaking of updates, one must not forget to dwell on the Britannica's unequalled yearbooks. Each annual volume contains the year in events, scientific developments, and everything you wanted to know about the latest in any and every conceivable field of human endeavor, or Nature. About 12,200 articles culled from the last 13 editions buttress and update the Encyclopedia's anyhow impressive offerings.

The Britannica provides considerably more text than any other extant traditional encyclopedia, print or digital (a total of 62 million words). But it has noticeably enhanced its non-textual content over the years (the 1994-7 editions had nothing or very little but words, words, and more words): it now boasts in excess of 30,000 images and illustrations (depending on the version) and 900 video and audio clips. This is not to mention the Britannica Classics: articles from Britannica's most famous contributors: from Sigmund Freud and Albert Einstein to Harry Houdini and from Marie Curie to Orville Wright.

The Britannica fully supports serious research. It is a sober assemblage of first-rate essays, up to date bibliographies, and relevant multimedia. It constitutes a desktop university library: thorough, well-researched, comprehensive, trustworthy.

The Britannica's 84-107,000 articles (depending on the version) are long and thorough, supported by impressive bibliographies, and written by the best scholars in their respective fields. The company's Editorial Board of Advisors reads like the who's who of the global intellectual and scientific community.

The Britannica is an embarrassment of riches. Users often find the wealth and breadth of information daunting and data mining is fast becoming an art form. This is why the Britannica incorporated the ""Personal Brain"" to cope with this predicament. But an informal poll I conducted online shows that few know how to deploy it effectively.

The Britannica also sports Student and Elementary versions of its venerable flagship product, replete with a Homework Helpdesk, ""how to"" documents, and interactive games, activities, and math and science tutorials. Still, the Britannica is far better geared to tackle the information needs of adults and, even more so, professionals. It provides unequalled coverage of its topics.

Ironically, this is precisely why the market positioning of the Britannica's Elementary and Student Encyclopedias is problematic: compared to the Wikipedia, the Britannica's brand is distinctly adult and scholarly. The vacuum left by the Encarta (lamented) discontinuance, though, should make it easier to market the Student and Elementary versions (which are an integral part of the Ultimate Edition and not sold separately).

Still, the 2011 editions of both the Student and Elementary encyclopedias improve on the past in terms of both coverage and facilities: the Homework Helpdesk is a collection of useful homework resources including a video subject browse; online learning games and activities; online subject spotlights; and how-to documents on topics such as writing a book review. There are also Learning Games and Activities: hundreds of fun and interactive games and activities to help students with subjects like Math, Science, and Social Studies. Both versions are updated monthly with new online-only articles.

The current edition is fully integrated with the Internet. Apart from articles about new topics and personalities in the news, it offers additional and timely content and revisions on a dedicated Web site. The digital product includes a staggering number of links (165,808!) to third party content and articles on the Web. The GeoAnalyzer, which compares national statistical data and generates charts and graphs, is now Web-based and greatly enhanced.

The Britannica would do well to offer a browser add-on search bar and to integrate with desktop search tools from Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and others. Currently it offers search results through Google but this requires the user to install add-ons or plug-ins and to go through a convoluted rite of passage. A seamless experience is in the cards. Users must and will be able to ferret content from all over - their desktop, their encyclopedias, and the Web - using a single, intuitive interface.

Some minor gripes:

The atlas, dictionary, and thesaurus incorporated in the Britannica are still surprisingly outdated. Why not use a more current - and dynamically updated - offering? What about dictionaries for specialty terms (medical or computer glossaries, for instance)?

Despite considerable improvement over the previous edition, the Britannica still consumes (not to say hogs) computer resource far in excess of the official specifications. This makes it less suitable for installation on older PCs and on netbooks. If you own a machine with anything earlier than Pentium 4, less than 1 Gb RAM, and less than 10 Gb of really free space, the Britannica would be clunky at best.

But that's it. Don't think twice. Run to the closest retail outlet (or surf to the Britannica's Web site) and purchase the 2010 edition now. It offers excellent value for money (less than $40, with a rebate). For less than the price of an antivirus software and for a fraction of the cost of Windows 7, you will significantly enhance your access to the sum total of human knowledge and wisdom.

With the demise of Microsoft's Encarta (it has been discontinued) and the tribulations of the Wikipedia (its rules have been revamped to resemble a traditional encyclopedia, alienating its contributors in the process), the Encyclopedia Britannica 2010 (established in 1768) may have won the battle of reference.

"""Curse of Blackmoor Manor"" is probably one of the most revolutionary games in the Nancy Drew series. First of all, this is the first Nancy Drew game to take place somewhere outside of the continental United States, which deserves recognition in and of itself (yes - Nancy's FINALLY going out of the country to solve a case!). Secondly, Nancy's suspect list has always before been equally populated by men and women, or has had two or three men to one woman. For the first time, Nancy has a case with mostly female suspects (three females and one male). I found this very interesting, and nicely thought through. Thirdly, this is one of the most challenging and frightening Nancy Drew titles, and was advertised as the most so when it was released.

Not only is the game revolutionary, but it's also awesome. The storyline is very intense, and the history surrounding Blackmoor Manor is so richly detailed. It's amazing to see how much thought must've gone into this game, and I imagine it took more effort from the creators than ever before.

A young woman named Linda has recently married Hugh Penvellyn, a wealthy British diplomat, and has gone over to start a new life with him and his stepdaughter in England. They live together in Blackmoor Manor, where the Penvellyns have lived for hundreds of years. However, shortly after she moves in, Linda begins to feel sickly and starts behaving bizarrely. She throws fits, hides behind a bed curtain all day, and refuses to eat healthy food. Nobody knows what's caused this change in her, and in a fit of desperation, her mom (who still lives in America) calls Nancy to ask her if she could fly out to England to find out what's happening to Linda.

Once she arrives in Blackmoor Manor, Nancy hears a sinister-sounding creature call out her name. When she looks around, she sees a pair of glowing eyes staring at her. Mrs. Drake, an elderly woman who's been taking care of the manor, answers the door, but not before the creature leaves. Mrs. Drake seems skeptical of what Nancy claims to have seen, but that doesn't stop Nancy from investigating. She soon discovers that one of the Penvellyns to own Blackmoor Manor was burned at the stake for witchcraft hundreds of years ago, and a beast she's rumored to have created had been prowling the moors for years. Could this beast have now returned? And why? And what (if anything) does it have to do with Linda? The answers to all these questions and more can only be found by solving this case...

This is probably one of the most unique plots in the Nancy Drew series.  This is the first time when she's not called in to investigate high-profile crimes, like murder, threats, vandalism, kidnapping, theft, and the like. ""Curse of Blackmoor Manor"" is also the first game to feature a family struggle that's turned into a mystery that Nancy is now called to solve. I enjoyed this plot quite a bit, and felt it was quite refreshing.

Blackmoor Manor is beautifully detailed. The graphics used in this game are superb, and even though it was released way back in 2005, the gaming quality and graphics still rival many games today. I really can't complain about the graphics, save for the fact that Jane's appearance might seem a tiny bit disproportional (but she's also young, short, and sitting down on a bed, which is hard to animate).

This game featured A LOT of puzzles, but they were all very well-explained and served a purpose for being there. I liked them all, and even though others might complain, I personally cannot. I also liked exploring the manor, which is rather large and has many places and things to see. My sole complaint is that at least half of the exploration takes place in the secret passageways, and I would've liked to see more of the ""outer surface"" of Blackmoor Manor.

There were also lots of fun mini games to play, so the player can find something else fun to do in the game if they're bored with solving puzzles and want to take a break from the mystery. The character Jane has several games that Nancy can play with her. All of them have to be played at least once to progress the game in some way, but they can all be played again as much as the player wants to (Jane's always up for play!).

All of the characters were very well-developed, and all had reason for being at the manor while Nancy was staying there. They also all had something to benefit by causing the haunting and horror surrounding Blackmoor Manor, and for terrorizing poor Linda. The first suspect met is Mrs. Drake, Hugh's aunt with a self-righteous attitude and believes the British to be superior to the Americans in every way. Nigel Mookerjee is a historian who's been hired by Mrs. Drake to write a book on the Penvellyns, and is looking for something in the family history to ""spice things up"" for his book. Jane Penvellyn is Hugh's 12-year-old daughter who's been forced to return to the manor after living in the United States for awhile, and seems to miss her biological mother very much. Ethel Bosinny is Jane's private tutor who only appears every so often, and is very elusive and mysterious in the sense that she never seems to be found in the same place twice (nor can when she'll appear be predicted).

The other characters and phone friends are all pretty nicely integrated too. I absolutely loved the fact that Nancy can call Ned again (as he hadn't appeared in a game since ""The Final Scene""), and the new method of getting hints that this game employed was very unique and fun. Rather than getting her hints from her phone friends, Nancy consults with Loulou, an 80-year-old female parrot who's residing in the manor. Loulou is very smart, and has quite a lot of funny comments to make about the case and everything involved. She's very well-scripted, and I loved talking to her because of how much comedic relief she added to the game.

All and all, the characters were great. I honestly didn't know who the culprit would be for sure until the end, but I did have my greatest suspicion leaning toward one particular person. This hunch was correct, but I was glad about that, as it employed two moves that needed to be done in culprit selection (one that'd never been done before, and one that was rarely done before). I won't say anything further, as I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't played...

""Curse of Blackmoor Manor"" had a great musical score. I liked the traditional British feel of the music, and it definitely suited the location of the mystery. Every now and then, it also got more eerie, which also added to the overall fright factor.

After being voted into the top three overall games, ""Curse of Blackmoor Manor"" was released in the Collector's Edition Fan Favorites pack with ""Treasure in the Royal Tower"" and ""The Secret of Shadow Ranch"". Did it earn its spot there? For sure! This game brought a true revolution to the Nancy Drew games, and remains one of the best even to this date. I've been playing this game for years, and I still jump a bit whenever I see phantoms and monsters creeping about the manor, watch clips of nightmares that Nancy has, or Ethel pops up in the middle of the night. It's a fun fright that's perfect for those who're willing to face their fears and solve one of the most terrifying cases that adventure gaming has ever known!",5
"Update 9/07- I would now have to downgrade NSW (ALL year versions!), to a ""1""!-
At the time Norton was good, other than slow loading, and a RESOURCE HOG (expert tests show uses system resources of 1308%!)!
I now use #1 rated (7 years) NOD32 anti-virus (only slows system 4%!)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NOD32-Antivirus-System/dp/B000RKY4ZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NOD32 Antivirus System</a>
It's a fairly complex /difficult to setup (see ""Blackspears NOD32 setup""- Google it), but worth it! For more startling stats see the NOD32 Anti-Virus comparative (their web site)...

You MUST first COMPLETELY uninstall NSW, before installing NOD32...!-
Norton now provides you with an easy ""ALL products"" uninstall tool called ""symnrt"" (search their web site!)(Don't Add/Remove anything, but the leftover pgms)(After a restart!))).
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Old review-
I am a home software tech (28 years).
I can see why SO MANY reviewers had so many NSW problems...!- NSW is tricky..., and difficult to install PROPERLY, especially if you had old Norton..., or ANY other anti-virus (see ""Fix-It Utility 6..."", below)!! NEVER run two ""active"" anti-virus, or anti-spyware!
My install procedures... (below) can be adapted for ALL Norton antivirus..., or any others (corrupted system too...!)!

Features+!-
1. NSW 2006 automatically updates NEW virus definitions DAILY (0-25). ALL older versions only update ""once a week (no matter how often you run Live Update!)""!
When NSW daily updates definitions, it automatically does a ""Quick Virus Scan""!

2. My email... scanning is MUCH faster, than with old Norton!
a. My Symantec total System Performance Test went UP from 295 to 1350 (DELL XPS400, 3.2ghz Pentium D cpu, Raptor 10,000rpm single sata hard drive (WOW!), 2000mb memory)!
b. System antivirus scan is a little slower, but more thorough (found 2 viruses my old Norton missed!)! Protection center takes a minute on startup to scan for security problems- GOOD!).
You should also consider GOOD ""full time"" spyware protection!-
#1 Spyware Doctor (84%, latest independent test...), or
#2 SpySweeper (66%). The rest are abysmal!

~~~
1. The biggest reason that sooo many people have dificulties..., is that they don't ""COMPLETELY"" get rid of their old antivirus/""LiveUpdate..."" first!!!
A simple add/remove... uninstall, won't do it!- Browse the Symantec support..., for uninstall instructions on your ""EXACT"", product BEFORE you attempt an uninstall (see SymNRT...)!
I found Symantec free email tech support to be fast (48 hrs max) and EXCELLENT!

Note A- Procedure (takes 1 hours+, to do it right!)! Print procedure out, before trying (VERY detailed/complex!)!

Note B- You may think this long procedure is a hassle..., but much better than a full system reinstall! It's FUN when things... go right, and an ""advanced"" learning experience!!!

 IMPORTANT NOTE C!- ALWAYS wait for your HD (Hard Drive) light to stop blinking (for 15 seconds)!- Just because ANY application... says Finished/Restart Now..., it hasn't removed/written/finished ALL the registry/files... yet! SLOW DOWN, & you'll see HD blinking!

Backup your ""critical..."" files (Favorites, cookies, email address book..., email ( I recommend ABC Outlook Express!- saves all & trees too!)  to an ""external"" source.

I  then use Acronis 9 (same as Ghost, but dependable!) for a ""Full Image Backup"", to a Western Digital external HD, and really like it (see my amazon.com Acronis 9 review...)! Easily restore your WHOLE system. Acronis is not compatible with Ghost or GoBack (NSW... also recommends NOT installing GoBack!)!

1. Disconnect from internet & restart.

2. COMPLETELTY uninstall/remove ALL previous Norton/Symantec... pgms &  tracks...!-
 a. Uninstall ALL old Norton... pgms- Norton..., GoBack, Ghost, Live Update, WMI, Live Reg... Restart after each! SLOW DOWN!
 b. Symantec uninstall NSW advisory, tells you how to FIRST disable ALL NSW services (VERY complex!), as XP uninstall will not ""completely"" remove old NSW files/registry... in use (many processes are hidden...!)!
You should not have to do this IF you ""lastly"" run #1 Fix-It Utilities 6 (see my Amazon.com review!). I disabled services... & Fix-It still found/deleted over 250 invalid registry/files (Cleanup, Fix Registry... Green only!). My ONLY ""safe"" registry/file cleaner that found/deleted ALL...!
Restart.

3.  Run chkdsk... (to repair ANY System/file errors...!)-
My Computer, RIGHT click on C drive, Properties, Tools, Error Checking, check Auto
Fix... (ALWAYS check!- System errors too!).
Restart, ""TWICE!"" & SLOW DOWN (all changes don't take effect, until HD light stops blinking!)!
  a. Defragment your HD ( I recommend Diskeeper 10 Professional Premier!- REALLY speeds up your computer (40%+ WOW!)!!!- see my amazon.com review)).
  1. WAIT 1 minute (Registry changes, after ANY defrag is slow!)! Restart!  You can also defrag from C Tools (as in error chkdsk... procedure above, but- Defragment Now instead of Error Check...)...

4. Now you are ALMOST ready to install NSW- On to ""Clean Install Mode""!-
ALL services & programs MUST be stopped (especially anti-spyware! See my amazon.com review on SpySweeper!).
This is how to safely/easily do a ""safe/clean install"" (for that matter- ALL pgm installs!), in disabled... mode.
 a. Start, Run, put "" msconfig "" (sans quotes) in box. OK
  1. Put a dot in Selective Startup. Remove check from Load Startup Items. Apply, Close (wait for HD lights!), Restart...
  2. OK, Cancel (gray boxes. Wait for hour glass & HD lights!)
  3. wait 1 minute & Defrag again (slow down! This makes NSW files contiguous/performance!) & restart TWICE...!

4. Now to install NSW (no internet, firewalls, no nothing!)-
 a. Dot in Custom Install!
  1. Uncheck- !GOBack! (Per NSW- plays havoc..., even if you don't have Acronis!). Utilities box, uncheck- System Doctor, Speed Disk, and any others...,  you don't use...
  2 . Good ones!- WinDoctor, DiskDoctor, Explorer Extension... (if you don't know..., leave them)...

b. IMPORTANT NOTE!- During the install it check/asks you if you want ""Worm Protection"". This is REALLY a sorta firewall, in disguise (I had to start over here... DRAT!, as it conflicted with my Sygate 5.5 firewall! DRAT)!
Luckily I had an Acronis system restore backup! (XP restore is flaky... & doesn't do it ALL!)!
  1. ONLY If you don't already have a 3d party firewall ( I really like Sygate ""5.5!, only!""!), REMOVE the check.
  a. If you only have the standard XP firewall, leave it in!
  3. Install NSW be VERY patient & SLOW DOWN (always!)!

c. Remove CD, Restart . SLOW DOWN!
  1. Manually start your 3d party firewall (if you have one), & log onto internet (hope you have high-speed!).  You may have to do this around... the NSW messages...
  2. Wait awhile, & Norton Protection Center will keep coming  up with ""do now..."" alerts!
  a. Whatever you do, ""always"" exit this now...!
  b. Whatever you do DON'T run ""One Button Checkup...""!
  3. Actvate NSW... (I didn't register?)
  4. If Live Update doesn't come up automatically (slow)-
Open NSW... & do a ""Live Update (biggy!). Be VERY patient (seems like not-responding, but is really working...). Restart when asked. SLOW DOWN!
  5. Enable 3d party firewall, and Live Update again. Keep doing this until no more updates.
Restart.

5. Disconnect from internet & go back to Run/msconfig..., and remove the gray check from Load Startup Items, again. Apply, Close (wait for HD lights!), Restart...
  a. Defrag again (packs NSW files, for performance).
  1 minute, & Restart.
b. Now go back to Run/msconfig... & put dot in ""Normal Startup"". Apply, Close (wait for HD lights!), Restart...
  1. Log onto internet. Restart.
  C. This is a GOOD time to do another Acronis backup!

6. DANGER!- All NSW Cleanups... will delete your IE favorites & cookies! To save them...-
  a. Open NSW, Options, Norton Cleanup, Internet Clutter & remove check from cookies..., ""Saved Web Sites"" folder & ""Import Favorites"", Apply, OK.
Restart (ANY changes... don't take full effect, until AFTER a restart!).

7. Now schedule a weekly system scan- Start, All Programs, Accessories, System Tools, Scheduled Tasks, RIGHT click on Norton Scan..., Properties, Schedule (set time...), Apply, OK. Close out... & Restart.
Do an Acronis back up...!

DONE!

"*This is the UPGRADE edition, not the FULL edition*

We should cover a few things about the editions before we review Vista. ""Starter"" is very basic and limited to 256MB of memory. Almost everything good about Vista is omitted. ""Home Basic"" does not have the Aero graphics flip windows special effects. ""Home Premium"" has limited networking interaction. ""Vista Business"" has the extended networking interaction. ""Vista Enterprise"" has UNIX and Virtual machine support. ""Ultimate"" has all the bells and whistles. Carefully choose what you want before you make this expensive purchase.

Installing Vista is very easy. This can be easily demonstrated by giving a child the DVD and a blank computer and saying ""install that"". Come back 5 minutes later and play with Vista. Checking with hardware vendors for patches and updates is a must. ""Windows Vista Upgrade Advisor"" will identify the changes needed. Many notebook manufacturers will recommend an updates pre-install patch before a Vista upgrade. A Vista upgrade will identify software on the system that might not be compatible. Depending on compatibility issues with an upgrade, a clean install is also optional and works on notebooks although driver installations must be done after. The install sequence is a matter of a few clicks and Vista is up and running. This might not be so simple if Vista is loaded on a virtualization platform like VMware which requires additional configurations of the BIOS and some other tweaks. We have come a long way since the days of Windows 3.1 insert disc #10. The first thing that strikes the user is the sheer speed at which Vista launches. This is most certainly Microsoft's fastest OS to date. As soon as Vista loads up, low and behold the ""gadgets"" display appears on the desktop with moving pictures, CPU meter, real-time news feeds, real-time weather, clock, notes, stock exchange, calendar and contacts. WOW, impressive stuff... but let's stop the press for a moment and tell it like it is... gadgets is just Apple OSX's ""widgets"" ripped-off (some might say that widgets existed before as separate plug-ins from Yahoo called ""Konfabulator"", but we are talking about this being inherently part of the OS, not plug-ins). It is an Apple invention that is in demand, much like the need for a desktop recycle bin  (which Apple didn't patent, doh!). Microsoft settles for just straight out burglary of Apple's innovation and hopes that the user just enjoys it. Truth-be-told, in modern times when everyone is downloading everyone else's stuff for free, Microsoft are even in on the game, and making money of it. However this is all about competition. Since the competition exists (and we may have some things to say about MS and monopoly) we should be thankful that other forces are driving MS to do what it may not have done without these pressures.  Who really cares if Vista is ultimately an Apple OSX rip? This is what Microsoft has always been about. At the same time Apple has openly accepted a Command Line Interface, MS right-click save as or open as and Intel chips. Balance things out. If you don't like Microsoft, then you know where to go. Third party software will probably sway you one way or another. However seeing OSx86 boot on VMware on top of Vista is something that makes you stop and think. Linux users simply front `customization' as the bonus to not going with Windows and in many ways they have a big point to make. Vista has the same lockdown Start Menu system. You just can't change it or put any folder anywhere you want. In a way this creates a standard (""Where does Johnny keep his documents on this system?"" ""Oh yeah, the documents folder!""), while at the same time professional users just want to custom the Start menu the way they like it, but can't. Microsoft hasn't really got a whole pile of originality going on here (although there are many gizmos included and bundled in the Ultimate pack) and for all intents and purposes Vista is OSX.

Vista is great. Its fast, fast, fast on a 3Ghz Pentium 4 or 1.66Ghz Core Duo. 1GB of ram will run it no problem. The first thing to do is to open a pile of windows, hold down the windows start key + tab, press tab repeatedly and watch as the screen turns into a flip 3D windows (the new Aero system). Also you can get a thumbnail preview of each running window on the task bar by rolling the mouse over it. That is very impressive. No longer are we pinned down to one desktop. Just scrolling through multiple Windows in 3D is a sight to behold and in the eyes of many will make the upgrade worth every penny. Vista also looks a whole world better than XP and is no longer plagued with a boring sterile look. Vista is art but then again the gadgets play an enormous role in this. Apart from that, Windows now has a beautiful fade in and fade out of the windows, some of which are transparent so you can see windows underneath. This is a whole new art dimension that Windows has never presented before and in many ways thankfully somebody decided to higher a graphic designer with all that money they make. Installing Office 2007 just brings it all to life, but that is another story.

99% of XP software will run on Vista. The only problem comes with software that creates virtual drives and devices. It seems Vista security (although Vista has been cracked already) is trying to prevent people from loading up an ISO on software like Daemon Tools. No doubt however someone out there will punch a hole through that one. 70Gigs worth of software running on XP here has installed no problem on Vista... and no BSOD (blue screens of death) or serious flaw seems apparent. While some software did not like the way it was installed, using Windows own manual driver installation just overcame those issues. For something so brand new it is hard to fault how stable this is.

XP users will complain that they have only just learned XP and see no reason why they need Vista. Right now nobody `needs' Vista. However Microsoft has indicated that some games (especially Xbox ports like Halo 2) and software will only be Vista compatible. If you like OSs and like what is cutting edge then don't hold back a moment longer and get it. If you need a system that is absolutely solid, then try out Vista and test on another system for a few weeks to see. You might be inclined to wait for Vista SP1 but to be honest I see no reason why most people can not use this, right out of box, right now. Like I said, I have ported my XP software over and Vista is just as stable... surprise!... well not really. Since Win2K, Microsoft got their stability issues sorted out and Apple seems just as exploitable these days and anybody who does the reading can see that it is. The very existence of OSx86 proves this. Vista gives you a little future boost too and that is probably the main reason to want it. This is going to be the future of Windows OSs for the next few years. The last time Windows released an OS was around the time of 911. It has been 6 years, the longest gap between Microsoft OSs in history, and it is worth the wait, especially imagining what Vista SP2 will deliver on. Many of us are still hoping for a lot of big things to change though. Why are we still using keyboards and why do we have to interface with our hardware this way? Bring on the multi-user touch-screen PC and give us a real show! Don't you think we all deserve it? We do.

The bottom line here is that this is stable future-tech. If that makes your eyes go bing then don't hold back a second more and just get this thing. You will be very pleased at experiencing the rush of a new OS once again.",5
"Do NOT believe all the knee-jerk garbage you're hearing about Vista, as 90% of it is being pulled out of thin air by people who obviously never even tried it.  Linux and Apple trolls scour the internet for chances to add negative reviews to an operating system they'v never even tried.

Then there are the XP hypocrites who have been using XP for so long that they fear anything new.

Hypocrytes you say?  Yup.  This same negative ""new Windows sucks"" propaganda wave happened when Windows 2000 was released in 1999 (nobody wanted ""NT"") and again when XP was released in 2002 (incompatibility problems, verybody absolutely HATED that ""Made by PlaySkool"" interface). Everybody hated each of them until the next version of Windows came along. Then, suddenly, they LOVED the older version and tried to cling to it. Not only pathetic, but now very predictable.  Vista is just the latest victim.

I have absolutely no love affair with Microsoft, trust me.  But it's time for an actual professional with a masters in programming and operating systems to set a few things straight.

Fact: Windows Vista was in development a whole year before Windows XP was even released. Microsoft had been working feverishly on this OS for 6 years at the time of its release. Little id you know that nearly EVERY Microsoft product that comes out is extensively tested by a public usability testing program that is totally seperate from their beta testing program. Microsoft doesn't let anything out the door until all the usability testers (the general public that come to visit the Microsoft facility in Redmond, Wa) say they like it. Vista was OK'd by both internal and external beta testers in addition to the usability test program, or it never would have been released. I have personally done usability testing at Microsoft 17 times now (I like to get my 2 cents in), and I know how this process works. Microsoft releases software BY CONSENSUS, and Vista is what the people themselves ASKED FOR.

Fact: For its entire life, the virus magnet that is known as Windows XP has been solely responsible for the onslaught of spyware, malware and waves of viruses. Not Mac. Not Linux. Not DOS. Not Unix. It was Windows XP. Prior to XP, Windows would see a problem virus come down the pike once in a while.  Then XP came along, and we've been swimming in viruses and Malware ever since.  Even loaded with antispy and antivirus software, WinXP STILL gets infested and slows to a blue-screening crawl. As you read this on your XP box, I guarentee that you have spyware on your system. Run a scan and see for yourself.  If you're just running Windows Defender, I guarentee you're LOADED with it and don't even know it - get better software immediately.

Fact: Though complaints about Vista's UAC are many, the Internet is not filled with Vista users begging to be saved from viruses and spyware they can't recover from. Those poor souls are pretty much all XP users.  The Vista users complaing of any viruses and spyware are the ones who turned UAC off or clicked right past the UAC warning prompts without evn reading them.

Fact: OF COURSE Vista is going to be slightly slower than XP on the same machine - just like Windows XP was slower than Windows 2000, which was much slower than Windows NT4, etc. etc. This is the natural way things are SUPPOSED TO BE AS HARDWARE GETS FASTER AND FASTER. C'mon, what do you honestly expect? New operating systems are about new features, not ""running faster"" on the same hardware (anybody that knows anything about operating systems knows that new versions are NEVER faster than the previous version, no matter what operating system it is - just take a look at any Linux distro or new version of any Mac OS). It's up to HARDWARE to make things run faster, not the OS. Your system is not fast enough to run Vista? THEN GET FASTER HARDWARE LIKE YOU HAD TO DO FOR XP. Has everyone forgotten that today's hardware is anywhere from 4-10 times faster than than the hardware that was available when XP was first released? And that XP absolutely crawled on our systems when it first came out and that we all complained about it?  And that Vista runs at virtually the same speed as XP once booted up - only with tons of new features? And that soon you will need a new OS to even be able to operate the dual quads already on the market and the dual octo-core systems right arounnd the corner? C'mon, people, get a grip and get kick that common sense glad into gear.

Fact: Since SP1 came out, Vista runs GREAT. I can run any Win32 program I want in Vista that I install, and as of SP1.  I might even be able to run old 16 bit apps now, haven't tried that yet.  Thanks to the freeware release of VDMSound, I am running old DOS games under Vista with full sound.  I repeat - DOS games.  Some of the few remaining software products currently being described as ""Non-Vista compatible"" can be made to work under Vista if you do a little reading and tweaking.

Fact:  Before SP1 came out for XP, XP ran like crap and had tons of compatibility problems.  Everybody hated it, even the way it looks.  Bet you forgot that.

Fact: Turn UAC (User Access Control) off if you want Vista to behave like XP and not prompt you for confirmations. It's as easy as un-checking a checkbox in Control Panel (User Accounts). Note: This will drop Vista security down to the same ""virus magnet/pants down"" level as Windows XP, however, so you decide.  The nice part is that you CAN decide.

Fact: Are you a gamer? Then you already know that Direct3D (DirectX) 10 is Vista-only. All you XP gamers can sit in your own DX9 drool if you want to. Meanwhile, we Vista users are walking around in DX10 games that look like movies. You oughtta see Crysis with dual nVidias running SLI.

Fact: Think you don't like Vista? Waiting for Windows 7 to come out in Q1 of 2010 (at the earliest without any of Microsoft's now legendary and predictable postponements)? You might be interested in knowing that Windows 7 is merely a re-packaging of Windows Vista - just like Windows XP was a re-packaging of Windows 2000 because 2000 didn't sell well (see for yourself at the command prompt - type ""ver"" and take note that Windows 2000 is Windows version 5.0 and Windows XP is version 5.1). Windows Vista is version 6.0. Dig up all the screen shots of Windows 7 you can find on the internet - take note that the title is ""Windows 7"" but the version number is 6.1.  In other words, STILL VISTA. So get used to Vista. Better yet, GET Vista, or you'll eventually be two Windows versions behind when 7 comes out - which won't be until 2010 (at the earliest), and then that version of Vista will be around for 5 years until the next version.

Vista's here to stay, folks. You have a choice of slipping into even more obsolescence with XP (which is just Windows 2000 with lipstick, a 9 year old product) or you can move forward with Vista and Win7.

For me personally, Vista has been spoiling me rotten since SP1 came out. Every time I get up from my Vista machines and sit down on my XP machines, it feels like I'm sitting down on a machine in ""Safe Mode"". Vista makes XP feel old, limited, cumbersome and inadequate. The search functions of Vista alone remove all need for clicking through layers of start menus, even often allowing me to not have to touch the mouse - this alone makes XP feel like an antique. I won't even get into how cool Desktop Search is, SuperFetch, ReadyBoost, or the other many new features that make Vista MUCH faster than XP in many respects.  Read that last sentence again, and then look those things up.  You may commence drolling on your poor ol' outdated XP box's keyboard.

BTW: No, I do not work for Microsoft, and I have been a huge Linux fan since 1997 (SUSE Linux, to be exact, version 11 is fantastic).  I ignore the fact that Linux always takes much longer for apps to load up (and runs clunkier in general) and that both KDE and Gnome always seems to look/work a lot like the latest version of Windows.",5

Many notebook manufacturers will recommend an updates pre-install patch before a Vista upgrade. A Vista upgrade will identify software on the system that might not be compatible. Depending on compatibility issues with an upgrade, a clean install is also optional and works on notebooks although driver installations must be done after. The install sequence is a matter of a few clicks and Vista is up and running. This might not be so simple if Vista is loaded on a virtualization platform like VMware which requires additional configurations of the BIOS and some other tweaks. We have come a long way since the days of Windows 3.1 insert disc #10. The first thing that strikes the user is the sheer speed at which Vista launches. This is most certainly Microsoft's fastest OS to date. As soon as Vista loads up, low and behold the ""gadgets"" display appears on the desktop with moving pictures, CPU meter, real-time news feeds, real-time weather, clock, notes, stock exchange, calendar and contacts. WOW, impressive stuff... but let's stop the press for a moment and tell it like it is... gadgets is just Apple OSX's ""widgets"" ripped-off (some might say that widgets existed before as separate plug-ins from Yahoo called ""Konfabulator"", but we are talking about this being inherently part of the OS, not plug-ins). It is an Apple invention that is in demand, much like the need for a desktop recycle bin  (which Apple didn't patent, doh!). Microsoft settles for just straight out burglary of Apple's innovation and hopes that the user just enjoys it. Truth-be-told, in modern times when everyone is downloading everyone else's stuff for free, Microsoft are even in on the game, and making money of it. However this is all about competition. Since the competition exists (and we may have some things to say about MS and monopoly) we should be thankful that other forces are driving MS to do what it may not have done without these pressures.  Who really cares if Vista is ultimately an Apple OSX rip? This is what Microsoft has always been about. At the same time Apple has openly accepted a Command Line Interface, MS right-click save as or open as and Intel chips. Balance things out. If you don't like Microsoft, then you know where to go. Third party software will probably sway you one way or another. However seeing OSx86 boot on VMware on top of Vista is something that makes you stop and think. Linux users simply front `customization' as the bonus to not going with Windows and in many ways they have a big point to make. Vista has the same lockdown Start Menu system. You just can't change it or put any folder anywhere you want. In a way this creates a standard (""Where does Johnny keep his documents on this system?"" ""Oh yeah, the documents folder!""), while at the same time professional users just want to custom the Start menu the way they like it, but can't. Microsoft hasn't really got a whole pile of originality going on here (although there are many gizmos included and bundled in the Ultimate pack) and for all intents and purposes Vista is OSX.

Vista is great. Its fast, fast, fast on a 3Ghz Pentium 4 or 1.66Ghz Core Duo. 1GB of ram will run it no problem. The first thing to do is to open a pile of windows, hold down the windows start key + tab, press tab repeatedly and watch as the screen turns into a flip 3D windows (the new Aero system). Also you can get a thumbnail preview of each running window on the task bar by rolling the mouse over it. That is very impressive. No longer are we pinned down to one desktop. Just scrolling through multiple Windows in 3D is a sight to behold and in the eyes of many will make the upgrade worth every penny. Vista also looks a whole world better than XP and is no longer plagued with a boring sterile look. Vista is art but then again the gadgets play an enormous role in this. Apart from that, Windows now has a beautiful fade in and fade out of the windows, some of which are transparent so you can see windows underneath. This is a whole new art dimension that Windows has never presented before and in many ways thankfully somebody decided to higher a graphic designer with all that money they make. Installing Office 2007 just brings it all to life, but that is another story.

99% of XP software will run on Vista. The only problem comes with software that creates virtual drives and devices. It seems Vista security (although Vista has been cracked already) is trying to prevent people from loading up an ISO on software like Daemon Tools. No doubt however someone out there will punch a hole through that one. 70Gigs worth of software running on XP here has installed no problem on Vista... and no BSOD (blue screens of death) or serious flaw seems apparent. While some software did not like the way it was installed, using Windows own manual driver installation just overcame those issues. For something so brand new it is hard to fault how stable this is.

XP users will complain that they have only just learned XP and see no reason why they need Vista. Right now nobody `needs' Vista. However Microsoft has indicated that some games (especially Xbox ports like Halo 2) and software will only be Vista compatible. If you like OSs and like what is cutting edge then don't hold back a moment longer and get it. If you need a system that is absolutely solid, then try out Vista and test on another system for a few weeks to see. You might be inclined to wait for Vista SP1 but to be honest I see no reason why most people can not use this, right out of box, right now. Like I said, I have ported my XP software over and Vista is just as stable... surprise!... well not really. Since Win2K, Microsoft got their stability issues sorted out and Apple seems just as exploitable these days and anybody who does the reading can see that it is. The very existence of OSx86 proves this. Vista gives you a little future boost too and that is probably the main reason to want it. This is going to be the future of Windows OSs for the next few years. The last time Windows released an OS was around the time of 911. It has been 6 years, the longest gap between Microsoft OSs in history, and it is worth the wait, especially imagining what Vista SP2 will deliver on. Many of us are still hoping for a lot of big things to change though. Why are we still using keyboards and why do we have to interface with our hardware this way? Bring on the multi-user touch-screen PC and give us a real show! Don't you think we all deserve it? We do.

The bottom line here is that this is stable future-tech. If that makes your eyes go bing then don't hold back a second more and just get this thing. You will be very pleased at experiencing the rush of a new OS once again.",5
"*This is the UPGRADE version*

We should cover a few things about the editions before we review Vista. ""Starter"" is very basic and limited to 256MB of memory. Almost everything good about Vista is omitted. ""Home Basic"" does not have the Aero graphics flip windows special effects. ""Home Premium"" has limited networking interaction. ""Vista Business"" has the extended networking interaction. ""Vista Enterprise"" has UNIX and Virtual machine support. ""Ultimate"" has all the bells and whistles. Carefully choose what you want before you make this expensive purchase.

"Look, I could write a review that tries to coddle those who are having a problem with this McAfee Virus Scan program, but for me, it is like finally arriving after a sea of disappointments. (I am talking about McAfee VirusScan Plus 2008-3 User Newest Version) Make sure you remove all other antivirus programs, and firewalls first before loading this McAfee Virus application. I have never seen an antivirus program that works properly with a 2nd antivirus program loaded at the same time.
It includes a Security Center, Virus Scan, Personal Firewall, Easy Network, and Site Advisor.

First of all forgive me for writing such a long review, but there is a lot of ground to cover. For those who like the short version, with less information here it is: Norton slowed my DSL connection down by a third. I spent a day with Verizon, couldn't figure out why all of my other machines in the network were getting 756k, and this one got only 4 or 500 tops. Then I removed Norton, and bingo, instant 756k. AVG free edition is nice but takes a lot of boot up time while it updates upon every single boot up, unless you disable that feature, then it sends out your Outlook email with a message that your antivirus is out of date, and this email could be dangerous, or something like that. Zone Alarm used to be the best, now they are nearing the worst. My Windows 2000 machine went blue screen after an update, took me 2 days to figure out that was the problem, so I removed it after discovering the problem in a forum, and it solved it. Also ZA after recommending it to my friend, would not work at all in a Windows XP Media Center machine. Ask ZA and they say they no longer support it in Media Center. 50 bucks down the drain. Now it takes my XP regular edition SP2 well over 5 minutes to boot with Zone Alarm Security Suite, and I mean WELL over 5 minutes; it's ridiculous. I removed it to load this McAfee Virus Scan (MVS), and the machine immediately booted in only 2 minutes and 15 seconds to the point I was able to bring a Google page up. So I loaded this MVS and the machine booted in only 2 minutes and 45 seconds, once again to a Google page appearing. In both cases I clicked on a Google desktop icon as soon as it appeared, and then waited for the results. It clicks, goes dark blue, and waits for everything else to load, including MVS before it will allow a page to appear. So MVS took only 30 additional seconds to load, and according to Scotty the watchdog in WinPatrol, it loads about 7 .exe files. So that is fast. Now that is with a machine that is loaded up with a ton of programs.

I first loaded MVS in my home office machine, in the same network, with the same configuration, Asus A8N SLI, AMD 64 3200+, 1Gb ram. The home office machine with MVS loaded, gave me the same results but in approximately one minute before I could get a Google page up. (This is an edit, I actually timed the boot up, and not counting the time to type in my password, it booted in exactly 42 seconds) Boot up to Google in only a minute with MVS, and in 2 minutes and 45 seconds in my overloaded machine that used to take well over 5 minutes with Zone Alarm. I'm sold.

While performing a scan it did not affect the performance of the machine, either in surfing the web, or opening programs, even the intensive programs like Dreamweaver MX 2004, or Photoshop CS2.

When loading do as the quick start guide says, put in the CD, then choose the option of loading from the web. It's a 45 Meg download, but it's the latest.

Manage network feature, it recognized all of the other machines, and components with an IP address in my network. It recognized my Windows Server 2003 R2 Edition, but gave me a status message of a request to upgrade to an operating system of at least W2000 or later. I guess that is because of W2003 security, blocking scans.

Before I even acquired MVS I did not understand exactly what they meant by the 3 user allowance, and couldn't find anything on it, so I want to share that with you. Did they mean that you could load it on one machine sharing a network, and then scan individual drives across the network, the same way early ZA did, or does this mean you can put it in more than one machine for full protection at all times. Fortunately it means the latter. I loaded it in the home office machine, registering it in my name to be able to get virus updates, and created a user name and password. Then I went into the other machine, dropped in the CD, did a complete install, but when the registration page came up, I logged in instead, and it instantly completed the registration for me, reminding me of my user name and password, and congratulating me on the installation. So it is a 3 machine complete install, that is cool, or should I say way cool.

I know this isn't about MVS but I advise you to get a free copy of CCleaner from the web. (Google it.) It cleans all the junk out of your computer and you can run it quickly before entering sensitive password sites for example. It cleans out your cache, cookies, etc. in only a few seconds. When you run it for the first time, it will take several minutes to remove it all, for example a ton of web pages you have been surfing, that your machine checks first, before drawing it from the distant server. A slooooow way for your machine to have to work.

McAfee has been around for a zillion years, they have been a leader, and from the performance of this product so far, they have totally aced it. You can see all of the other antivirus and firewall programs I have tried, and this one according to boot up time, and scan speed is the best. It scanned my office machine quickly, although I did not time it accurately. It scanned several gigs of data in what seemed like 10 minutes. My other machine with 230 Gigs of data takes about 5 hours with Zone Alarm, because I am using their older 7.0 version, it took 3 times that long with their newer version that works with Vista and XP. I am using it on an XP machine. Once again, had to get rid of the update, and go back to an earlier version.

Look I can't speak for everyone, or everyone's machine, but all I know is I am totally impressed with this McAfee product, and hope and pray they don't go down the tubes like Norton, and Zone Alarm did. (I have not used any recent Norton products, but Norton was the best when Peter Norton was there solving the DOS problems, almost like a miracle man, then from about 10 years ago, everything of theirs I tried was junk.) Sorry for the pointed remarks, but sometimes you find a product, after spending years in frustration, or at least you find something that works, then it goes bad, and finally, finally, something that really works great like this MVS. For me, my hat is off to McAfee. 150 Stars and counting. Highly recommended to say the least.
PS: I noticed another reviewer was having problems logging onto online acounts, so I put it to the test, logged into my bank account, which is a 3 step process, and also my online server, and did not have any problems. If I have any, or notice anything after using this product more, I will come back and edit the review. All of the essentials place this one at the top for now.",5
"It is hard to believe it is two years since Corel released X3.  When I found out that the new X4 version had been released, I downloaded the one month demo from Corel.

I don't have much use for anything in the suite except WordPerfect.  I've been using WordPerfect since before Windows, when it had a blue screen, displayed ASCII characters in Courier font (there were no fonts except Courier), and laser printers cost a small fortune. I work for a number of attorneys -- WordPerfect is the software of choice for word processing in most offices I've worked in because, in my opinion, it is the better product for the job. It may also be because WordPerfect has been around for so long that everyone just migrated without changing. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!

Universal File Support -- Limited PDF support in Home/Student Edition

WordPerfect has very good compatibility with other file formats making it nearly universal.  The more expensive version of WordPerfect handles PDF files and will import text and graphic based PDF files and will perform optical character recognition on the PDF file.  As the comment below shows, Corel indicates this version does not open PDF files, although it will publish to PDF.  Please see [...] for a comparison of the different versions.

Although it is not perfect, WordPerfect converts to and from numerous Word formats including RTF, and all versions through 7.  It also supports other formats including WordStar, AMI, OfficeWriter, Lotus, Multimate and numerous others.

Skins

Corel also added two themes so that the skin looks more like XP/Vista, and for those who need it, the Word Count feature is on the application bar at the bottom of the WordPerfect window.  This new version appears to be very stable.

Exceptional Word Processing Capabilities

When WordPerfect came out, it took over the market. (It was far superior to the software then available, and remains one of the best.) When MicroSoft came out with Word, I had the feeling they did everything they could to make it different from WordPerfect just to use their power in the industry to take over the word processing market, just like MicroSoft did with every other good software idea to come along. (e.g., Mozilla/Netscape, Norton Utilities.)

I have three versions of Word (2000, 2003 and 2007) and WordPerfect 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, X3 and now X4.  I use the MicroSoft product only when absolutely necessary -- usually because someone else sends me a document in that format. The new version of Word is extremely powerful.  It is just that like most M/S software, it does too much and takes the control away from the user.  It is also unfamiliar to me because the traditional pull down menus have been placed sideways on toolbars and rearranged so it is uncomfortable to use.  Accordingly, I prefer to use WordPerfect and save the output as a Word document using the ""SAVE AS"" feature on the ""file"" pull down menu.

The reason I like WordPerfect so much is that it types more like a typewriter. You can set up and use styles if you want, but you can also just hit the tab button to indent the first line of a paragraph. If you want to change the margins for the entire document, you simply change the margins. The rest of the document follows the change. You don't have to change each paragraph. If you want to change one paragraph, you can do it with a single keystroke (the WordPerfect 6 keystrokes are F4 for left indent or Shift-F4 for double indent).

In addition, you can get to the formatting codes. Hit Alt-F3 and the screen splits in half and displays all of the format codes -- bold, underline, tabs, indent codes, line spacing, column on and off, etc. Then you know exactly what you have done and fix and format it easily. This ability has proven useful on several occasions when clients, who insist on using Word for legal documents, cannot cajole Word to put their unruly documents into the format they want. (This is particularly true when using OCR with scanned or faxed documents.) By opening the Word document in WordPerfect, I have been able to use ""Alt-F3"" to identify the errant codes and quickly repair them. WordPerfect can then save the document in Word/RTF format with the problems fixed. This is particularly useful when combined with the global search and replace. For example, you can search and replace all [paragraph style] codes and end up with a manageable document.

Working with columns is also easier. You turn on columns and tell it how many colums you want, set the width of each, and the space between them, and away you go. You have four types of columns to work with -- newspaper, balanced newspaper, parallel and parallel with block protect. I've tried the other software, and if you change text or printers, you can never get the columns to line up the way you want it. With Word, each column change or page change seems to introduce a whole new set of control codes, and a complete set of formatting, and you can never get it back the way you want it. I once tried to scan in a list of names and addresses which were in two or three columns into Word. Each name and address was placed in its own text box. I could never work with it.

Another very important feature is the ability to view a document from the ""open document"" screen without having to actually open up the document. This way, if you are searching for a specific document or a document containing certain specific information or ""language"" you need, you don't have to serially open a document, close it, open another document, and so on until you find the one you want. This is particularly powerful when combined with the ""find document"" feature on the ""open document"" screen. Using the find button opens a screen which is similar to the windows ""search"" screen. You can type in a series of words, and WordPerfect will search all files on the hard drive or in the folder/subfolders in which you are working for all documents containing your target search terms. You can then scroll through and look at each document to quickly determine their contents. From the ""find"" screen, you can access the ""quickfinder"" program which pre-scans folders on the computer so that searching for documents is nearly instantaneous. For example, once I needed to find a ""Declaration re Ex Parte Notice"" to use as a template from among thousands of documents. The entire search took perhaps half a minute.

The most prominent change between WP 10 and 12/X3/X4 is the workspace manager which allows you to switch between legal mode, original (classic) WordPerfect 5.1 mode (with the blue screen), legal mode, standard WordPerfect for Windows mode and Word mode. They have also included and upgraded the ability to publish to Adobe PDF, HTML, and RTF/Word formats.

This is full featured software, and does everything I need. It handles tables, tables of content, tables of authorities, column sorts -- everything I need in a law office. Graphics can be dropped in with a click of the mouse. I'm considered to be almost an expert, and there is a lot I don't know!

One of the great advantages of WordPerfect is that the files are much smaller than Word documents. This means you can transport them on floppy drives.

As a final thought, Word is very powerful and works very well for short documents such as business letters. If you do anything over several pages, you are much better off with WordPerfect.

Take time to get to know the software and you'll be glad you purchased it.

Other Programs:

The Corel Office package includes replacement programs for most of the stuff in Microsoft Office.  The suite includes a Microsoft Outlook replacement (Mail), a PowerPoint replacement (Presentation), an exceptional spreadsheet program (Quattro) and Lightning.  I haven't yet figured out what Lightning does except act as a notebook of some sort.",5
"Please see [...] for a comparison of the features in pre-ribbon versions of Word to WordPerfect.  It is enlightening!

It is hard to believe it is two years since Corel released X3. When I found out that the new X4 version had been released, I downloaded the one month demo from Corel. Based on the $150 difference in price between this version and the student/home version, I would seriously consider the student version.  It is my understanding that it is very similar, if not the same.  The Student/Home version apparently lacks the PDF capabilities of the Standard and Pro versions, so if you need those capabilities, buy this version.  (I would check with with Corel to be certain if all the features are present.)

I don't have much use for anything in the suite except WordPerfect. I've been using WordPerfect since before Windows, when it had a blue screen, displayed ASCII characters in Courier font (there were no fonts except Courier), and laser printers cost a small fortune. I work for a number of attorneys -- WordPerfect is the software of choice for word processing in most offices I've worked in because, in my opinion, it is the better product for the job. It may also be because WordPerfect has been around for so long that everyone just migrated without changing. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!

Universal File Support

WordPerfect has very good compatibility with other file formats making it nearly universal. It includes PDF file support which Corel continues to improve in this version. It saves directly to PDF format Corel has now added optical character recognition so you can import PDF files directly into a text document. Although it is not perfect, it converts to and from numerous Word formats including RTF, and all versions through 7. It also supports other formats including WordStar, AMI, OfficeWriter, Lotus, Multimate and numerous others.

Skins

Corel also added two themes so that the skin looks more like XP/Vista, and for those who need it, the Word Count feature is on the application bar at the bottom of the WordPerfect window. This new version appears to be very stable.

Exceptional Word Processing Capabilities

When WordPerfect came out, it took over the market. (It was far superior to the software then available, and remains one of the best.) When MicroSoft came out with Word, I had the feeling they did everything they could to make it different from WordPerfect just to use their power in the industry to take over the word processing market, just like MicroSoft did with every other good software idea to come along. (e.g., Mozilla/Netscape, Norton Utilities.)

I have three versions of Word (2000, 2003 and 2007) and WordPerfect 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, X3 and now X4. I use the MicroSoft product only when absolutely necessary -- usually because someone else sends me a document in that format. The new version of Word is unfamiliar - the traditional pull down menus have been placed sideways on toolbars and rearranged so it is uncomfortable to use. If possible, I will use WordPerfect and save it as a Word document using the ""SAVE AS"" feature on the ""file"" pull down menu.

The reason I like WordPerfect so much is that it types more like a typewriter. You can set up and use styles if you want, but you can also just hit the tab button to indent the first line of a paragraph. If you want to change the margins for the entire document, you simply change the margins. The rest of the document follows the change. You don't have to change each paragraph.

In addition, you can get to the formatting codes. Hit Alt-F3 and the screen splits in half and displays all of the format codes -- bold, underline, tabs, indent codes, line spacing, column on and off, etc. Then you know exactly what you have done and fix and format it easily. This ability has proven useful on several occasions when clients, who insist on using Word for legal documents, cannot cajole Word to put their unruly documents into the format they want. (This is particularly true when using OCR with scanned or faxed documents.) By opening the Word document in WordPerfect, I have been able to use ""Alt-F3"" to identify the errant codes and quickly repair them. WordPerfect can then save the document in Word/RTF format with the problems fixed. This is particularly useful when combined with the global search and replace. For example, you can search and replace all [paragraph style] and end up with a manageable document.

Working with columns is also easier. You turn on columns and tell it how many colums you want, set the width of each, and the space between them, and away you go. You have four types of columns to work with -- newspaper, balanced newspaper, parallel and parallel with block protect. I've tried the other software, and if you change text or printers, you can never get the columns to line up the way you want it. With Word, each column change or page change seems to introduce a whole new set of control codes, and a complete set of formatting, and you can never get it back the way you want it. I once tried to scan in a list of names and addresses which were in two or three columns into Word. Each name and address was placed in its own text box. I could never work with it.

"Okay - I've read a lot of reviews here and on various tech blogs and mac product sites, and I hear a few common things that I'll confirm or deny in this review.  There's also a must-have bit of performance information at the end, which you might already know about, but it is important - if you read that far and it's helpful, please vote for this review.

My perspective: I use Windows and Macs, both personally and for work.  This is NOT a windows-vs-mac review, it is a ""I use a Mac, should I use Snow Leopard"" review.

1. ""It's not that big of a difference""
FALSE.
It's not packed with new features, but it is different - those differences will be very noticeable if you're a power user.  Everything is a bit faster.  Just a bit, so non-power users might not notice as much.  However, while it will not speed up your old MacBook by 6000%, it will increase the stability of it, and if you really need a performance boost, you can get that by adding more RAM in addition to upgrading to Snow Leopard.  Why?  64-bit OS means much better memory handling, allowing you to make better use of RAM >4GB.  If you're a power user, going 64-bit and adding a massive heap (8GB or more) of memory is well ... imagine trading up your wardrobe from rough canvas to cashmere. Same feeling.

2. ""It's not 64-bit really"".
FALSE.
It's 80% 64 bit even when running in '32 bit mode"", which means your kernel extensions are 32 bit and everything else is 64 bit.  If you want it to be all 64-bit, hold '6' and '4' while booting and from then on your in 100% 64-bit land. (holding '3' and '2' gets you back).  The only application that I had that wouldn't run in 64 bit mode was VMWare Fusion, so I ran in 32 bit mode for a while (I need VMWare for work).  However, they've upgraded, and now I'm in 64 bit mode all the time.

3. ""I got tens of gigabytes of HD space back!""
TRUE.
10.6 handles files differently (mostly by stripping out legacy PPC code) and as a result you'll get a boat-load of free space back. This is important - see the very end of this review for WHY it's important.

4. ""It doesn't work with my old copy of XYZ Software from 2006""
FALSE
Okay, this is probably really true for some apps, but for most, you can get them to work by a) running in 32-bit mode (which is default, by the way), or b) installing Rosetta - which is an optional install but gives you some bonus backwards compatibility.  However, this violates one of the golden rules of computing, which is: DONT UPGRADE YOUR OS IF YOU'RE UNWILLING TO UPGRADE OTHER APPS ALSO.  People who gripe about how Mac OSX no longer supports their antiquated Hypercard application from 1989 make me sad.

Basically, don't believe rumors about compatibility - go to the source and verify it yourself.  For example, based on reviews here, you'd think that CS3 doesn't work. Adobe hasn't tested CS3, but in one adobe blog there's confirmation that Photoshop CS3 works ... [...]

5. ""The new dock/expose feature is awesome""
TRUE.
Need to see it/use it to believe it, but the new dock/expose features really are awesome.  It's not just eye-candy: you click and hold on a dock icon and you get a quick zoom-out to show open windows for that app.  Why is this so great? You're working on a Word document, and need to send it to someone for review.  You (like most modern computer users) have a zillion things open. You draft an email, and then need to attach the document. Where the heck is it?  Go to Word, click-hold on the little document icon in the title bar to select the document without having to go to the finder (which is a great tip in itself), and then drag it down to Mail int he doc.  When expose kicks in, move over to the email you were working on, and in an instant you have the doc attached to your email.  One word: BRILLIANT.

6. ""This Feature or Function seems faster""
TRUE.  Everything feels snappy in Snow Leopard.  In many cases (many video codecs, anything with high-CPU requirements) it actually is faster. This is due in part to using the your GPU for normal computing tasks.  It's also due to the zillion other refinements made to the core OS .. which is the whole point to Snow Leopard.

7. ""I need to run Windows (or VMWare, etc) because of work, so This is irrelevant""
FALSE.
No, I'm not going to chime in on the mac-vs-pc debate ... but 10.6 does include built-in exchange support. If you own a Mac version of MS Office, chances are that Snow Leopard will let you get your job done without every having to click on a Start bar.  Yes, in some specialized fields there will be applications that you'll need to run that don't have Mac equivalents.  But for most of us, exchange is the only thing holding us back from running a Mac as their primary OS in the workplace.

So why do I need VMWare (as mentioned above)?  Because my office uses an old RICOH all-in-one printer/copier/scanner/fax thingy, and there are no OSX drivers for it (and none of the generic or open source drivers work with it).  So, and this is not a joke, I only use VMWare to print.  I've considered buying myself a cheap printer for my office, but VMWare works well enough that it doesn't bother me.

8. ""Snow Leopard is Apple's Vista""
FALSE.
Again, not to start that debate, but please acknowledge a) that the mac-vs-pc debate exists, b) people feel strongly about it, and c) they will post 1-star reviews claiming things like this in order to... well, I'm not sure why they do it, but they do.  Mac users do it too. Please keep in mind that Snow Leopard is primarily a ""refinement"" release - aimed at fixing long-standing bugs and inefficiencies in OS X.  If you read a review that mentions Vista, chances are it's from a PC fanboy who has never used a Mac.  Don't take my word for it -- simply judge reviews based on their merit. If there's a real example of why SL is bad, consider it.  If the review says ""this was a big mistake, I had to re-install Leopard"" with no supporting evidence, I wouldn't give it much credibility.  If someone claims that ""SL made my system slow down to a crawl,"" weigh that against this and a zillion other reviews that confirm apple's claims of a speed improvement.  ... 'nuff said.

9. ""It's not worth $[...]""
FALSE.
If you bought an extra 20+ GB of physical hard drive storage, you'd pay more than thirty bucks for it.  If you're busy, the extra time you'll get back because of stability is worth thirty bucks.

And, now a caveat and the afore mentioned tip:

QuickTime X is awesome, but it lacks 90% of the features of QUickTime 7 ""Pro"".  If you've never used QUickTime Pro (i.e, if you haven't paid $[...] to Apple for a QT Pro license), this won't concern you.  If you did, you need to be aware that you'll still need QUickTime 7 if you want to cut-and-paste within movies, extract tracks, convert file formats, etc.  Luckily, QT 7 is available as an optional install (and will take your pro license), so it's not a real issue, but it is something the be aware of.

The tip: OS X loves -- nay, it *needs* -- free disk space to operate optimally.  If you're running less that 20% free space, performance will start to degrade.  Now, SL will give you back some of that free space if you're upgrading from previous OS X's, but HDs tend to fill up quickly.  I have SL running on a MacPro and a MacBookPro, and my 'book started to slow down.  Turns out that a combination of downloading the first season of ""the Prisoner"" and playing Tochlight in a Windows VM caused my drive to fill up rather quickly.  I can't stop playing Torchlight (I can't wait until the Mac version is available, I'll buy it twice its that good), but I got around my iTunes TV addiction by buying an Apple TV ... which offloaded about 80GB of movies and TV shows.  Now things are running fast and clean again. So, if you're seeing a performance slow-down in OS X, whatever version it is, check your free disc space.  HDs (even laptop HDs) are cheap, and could end up being the upgrade of your dreams.  Okay ... maybe the tip wasn't that great, but what do you expect from an amazon review?  :-)",5
"I've been using Windows 7 since its beta release, but my laptop's been running the final version for weeks now. I really disliked Vista and preferred XP still, but Windows 7 has tipped the scales...finally. Windows 7 has been reliable and it's snappier than Vista.  Windows 7 sips laptop battery power so my 1-year-old Dell XPS M1530 runs longer under Win7 than it did under Vista.  But what I really like about Windows 7 are the new or improved features it offers. Here's a list of my favorites:

#1 VIRTUAL LIBRARIES
With virtual libraries, the special folders like Documents, Pictures, Music and Videos have all become libraries. Instead of being a physical storage location, they're indexes that point to one or many locations on the computer you're using, as well as other computers you're networked with. In a home setting, where you're running Windows Home Server, you can now easily direct file stores to your server. When coupled with Offline Files & Folders (a features that the non-Home editions of Windows offers since XP), you can easily take your server data with you, even when you're in a disconnected state. Also in the home, housemates can easily see each others' data by including their respective folders in one another's libraries. When you search a library, you're searching your computer and any other computer that has folders you've added to your library.  This is, for me, the single best feature of Windows 7, and is an excellent reason to upgrade.

#2 START SEARCH
The Start Search has been improved in Windows 7 so results appear instantly as soon as you click the Start button, and then either type the name of a program on your computer, or a task you'd like to perform (like, ""change my display settings""). No more hunting folder hierarchies to find that elusive program, or spend time figuring out where Microsoft has placed something in the Control Panel. This is a tremendous time-saver.

#3 AERO SNAP
The Aero user interface has three new tricks -- Shake, Peek, and Snap -- but only Aero Snap is a major leap forward. Have you ever tried comparing the contents of two windows together, side-by-side? It's painful to do because you have to fiddle with resizing the two windows. With Aero Snap, now all you do is grab the title bar of one window, sling it to the left, and Windows 7 will automatically resize the window to fill-up one-half of your screen display. Do the same with a 2nd window by slinging it to the right, and it'll fill-up the right-side of your display. You can start comparing two windows in...an Aero Snap. Aero Shake and Peek are cute, but not nearly so helpful.

#4 TASKBAR
Gone is the Quick Launch bar that too many people didn't know existed. Now, the whole Taskbar is a quick launch bar -- drag and drop any program icon onto the bar, and you're one click away from starting the program. Also, it's so easy to move the taskbar around now. I keep it on the left vertical on my computer. Gone is the system tray, too -- Notification Area takes its place. The Action Center alerts you to anything you need to do to keep your computer working smoothly.

#5 PROGRAM COMPATIBILITY (including XP Mode)
Any program can be run in one of many compatibility modes now. Windows 7 has a wizard that will help you pick the right, earlier version of Windows under which to run an older program. You can do the same thing more quickly by right-clicking on a program icon, click the Compatibility tab, enable Compatibility mode, and select the earlier version of Windows you want. For truly stubborn XP programs, the Professional edition offers XP Mode -- a fully licensed, virtualized copy of Windows XP. Note that your hardware must support virtualization for this to work.

#6 STICKY NOTES
Less functional that the Vista Sticky Notes -- which nobody used -- but now I actually use Sticky Notes to put reminders on my Desktop. They're quick, easy, and work just like a regular Post-It note only you don't get fingerprints on your screen!

#7 JUMP LISTS
There are two kinds -- Jump lists that let you quickly pick a task to perform, and Jump lists to quickly select a document to open and edit in the associated program. These are nice time-savers.

#8 SAVED SEARCHES
In Windows Explorer, you can create filtered searches and then save them in your Favorites for later use. This is handy to find filtered data in the future. When you re-execute the search, it creates a dynamic results set (so your search is never stale).

#9 CONTENT VIEW & ARRANGING
Also in Windows Explorer, two new features. Now you can arrange a folder into subdivisions by date (great for your pictures folders!). You can use the Content view to combine thumbnails of files along with details that usually are found only in the Details view.

#10 USER ACCOUNT CONTROL
Most everyone hated UAC in Vista (even though it helped to keep your computer safe). In Windows 7, Microsoft tamped down the annoyance factor of UAC. You can change your date and time without setting off UAC, for example. You can also decide whether UAC should go into secured Desktop mode whenever it does get triggered (secured Desktop is when your screen darkens and you're forced to respond to UAC's dialog box asking permission to run a program or make a change to your system). You can easily turn-off UAC, too.

#11 PAINT, WORDPAD, CALCULATOR
All three of these utilities got updated. Wordpad and Paint have the Office-like ""ribbon"" now, and Calculator has a few new memory keys, touch sensitivity, and a Programmer view for those dealing with hexidecimals and binaries.

#12 HOMEGROUP SHARING
This is the easiest way to share data with others in your (home) network. HomeGroup creates a password that is shared among computers, and that takes care of all the issues with user accounts, file permissions and ""access denied"" problems. While not appropriate for corporate use, this is great for the home.  I made this feature last because I'm not using it -- I just think it's a great idea for inexperienced users.  Note:  all the networked computers need to be running Windows 7 to make HomeGroup sharing work.

Upgrading advice:  I went through the upgrade process twice.  Here's what I learned to do before and after the upgrade:  1)  Remove Adobe Reader and reinstall the latest version (9.2 as I write this) after the upgrade.  Older versions of Reader won't render correctly in Windows 7 and an IE8 browsing session.  2) Remove your antivirus, anti-malware and anti-spyware programs, and reinstall them after the upgrade using the latest versions available.  3)  Remove any virtualization programs (like VMWare Workstation) and reinstall following the upgrade.  4)  After the upgrade, look for the latest video driver from the video card maker, not by your computer hardware vendor (in my case, it was getting a new driver from Nvidia rather than from Dell).

Looking to do a clean install using this upgrade disk?  You can, but here's how.  Insert the DVD and choose ""Custom"" to do the clean install.  During the install, DO NOT enter your product id or activate Windows -- yet.  Instead, you'll finish the clean install, reboot, then use your DVD to do an upgrade of the clean install of Windows 7.  Yes, you're upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 7.  After you upgrade, then enter your product id and activate Windows.  I haven't tried this out personally, but others have and have done so successfully.  Add a comment to my review to share your experience if you go this route.  Final note:  This tip isn't intended to circumvent the stipulations in the licensing agreement for upgrading your computer.  If you're not entitled to upgrade (because, say, you're using Windows 95, 98, 2000, or ME), then you must buy the full version.  As I tell my kids, ""Just because you can do a thing doesn't mean you should do a thing.""  :-)

And finally, my few quibbles with Windows 7:  My Dell XPS M1530 has always had sporadic issues resuming from a sleep or hibernate state under Vista.  That still is the case, even with Windows 7.  I'm not convinced, though, that the underlying problem is an operating system issue as much as a hardware/BIOS problem, so I can't knock Windows 7 for this problem.  Not all my laptops have had similar power-on problems, even under Vista, so my advice to you is to NOT expect Windows 7 to solve any power-on problems from a sleep or hibernate state if you've currently got those problems with your laptop.

Lastly, if you like to periodically examine the Reliability Monitor in Vista, it's not as nice in Windows 7 -- there is no precise data value assigned to your machine's ever-changing reliability metric.  And it's impossible to find in the Control Panel (but it's easy to do a Start Search on).  The graph is still there, though, and it's updated hourly instead of daily.  For most people, I'm guessing this is a complete non-issue.

In short, think of Windows 7 as Windows Vista done right.",5
"Just like Windows 7 Ultimate for my dual-booting Intel Macs, Windows 7 Professional on my former Vista laptop makes for a great Internet access terminal from the comfort of our futon. It also makes for a great secondary Windows 7 laptop for trips to my Aunt Wilda and Uncle Eay's house. When we are there it sits in their living room with an external Microsoft mouse and it is perfect for that too.

You see, I insist on optimum software for my computers, so that they can do everything I need. Windows Vista Home Premium on that laptop just was not providing it. It wasn't as terrible as some people say it is, because I spent more money for better hardware. But there were times when I wanted to take it back-and one time I almost did. They didn't accept it though, and that was most fortunate as it turned out.

And yes, I found out that Windows Vista Home Premium couldn't be upgraded in place to Windows 7 Professional. But unlike some people, I had seen that, for me at least, Windows 7 was worth the hassle, and sure enough it has been.

I use Office 2007 on the Professional laptop as well as the Ultimate MacBook Pro, and it has pleased me to all get out. I however don't have any more resources for legal Office 2007, so the iMac will get 2010 Professional through that student offer once I get enough money. Windows 7 and Office 2007, especially on the Professional laptop, seems to be plenty sufficient though-Daddy is the resident March Madness Bracketologist at his workplace and Windows 7 Professional amd Office 2007 Professional's cooperation has really benefited him in that.

I love being able to Remote Desktop the Windows 7 laptop from the iMac or MacBook Pro, although I might have to try Windows Live Mesh from Windows Live Essentials to see if it can remote desktop in Aero like on the commercials.

I like Windows 7 Professional on the former Windows 7 laptop just as much as I do Windows 7 Ultimate on the Intel Macs, considering their respective purposes. Their roles are different, but each fulfills it's role perfectly, and Windows 7 Professional facilitates that in a way Windows 7 Home Premium just wouldn't.

Update 1-17-2013: I will be updating all of the reviews for all of the Windows 7 installers I have on tap to reflect a certain difference betweem me and the average reviewer:

I to date have done all of my installs (whether of Ultimate Full Purchase Product, Ultimate Upgrade, Professional Upgrade through the Windows 7 Student Offer, Home Premium Upgrade, or Home Premium Upgrade Family Pack) through the clean install method and it never fails to grab all of the updates, update to SP1, and then grab the missing post-SP1 updates.

I therefore believe that the people who can't fully update Windows didn't do the clean install method, and while I don't blame them, I don't have the time personally for a system that behaves strangely because Windows Vista was trying to be transmuted into Windows 7, when it's hard enough for one service pack of Windows 7 to be successfully transmuted into another.

I hope that if you are blaming Windows 7 for your issues when upgrading from Vista, that this advice can be of use.

Update 2-3-2014:

Windows 7 is a good OS for those people who don't want a Mac but don't want Windows 8 either. It does do Classic appearance differently from Windows Vista and earlier, instead using the square buttons even in Classic appearance, but that's OK, because I dreamed of an OS with this functionality in the taskbar since Windows 95. And the redesigned taskbar is even in Windows 7 Home Premium. Sure you may lose some of the features in the Ultimate Edition, but you get everything you absolutely have to have-although Windows 7 Anytime Upgrade is no longer available to Windows 7 users, so buying the right edition of Windows 7 is extra-crucial. If you buy Windows 7 Home Premium and later find out you need XP Mode, you're going to have to sell your copy of Home Premium (assuming you're using the retail copy) and replace it with a retail copy of Ultimate or Professional.

Windows XP may have been great in 2001, but Windows 7 is as close to XP as you can make Vista-and has proven worthwhile ever since 2009.

For further proof, look at how Microsoft released Internet Explorer 10 and 11 for Windows 7, they sure didn't have to do that. But they realized Windows 7 was still popular (so popular I have 7 copies of it, including a Family Pack of Home Premium) and so they released as many of their updated components as they could for Windows 7 without totally making Windows 8/8.1 a non-issue.

End Update 2-3-2014

Update 2-21-2014:

The laptop I feared was dead just needed someone to show it was still important and cared for. Once done, it's now back working and let me tell you, I don't care that the laptop I'm currently running this copy of Windows 7 Professional on is 32-bit only and is a Pentium Dual-Core version of a Core Duo with 2GB of memory. I will take it and leave Windows 8 regular edition craptops for those who feel like playing with their digital lives.

Me? I want something that no matter how old, was highly regarded upon release, and not a zoo's worth of headaches from the underpinnings to the bifurcated UI and everything in the middle.

Windows 7 Professional may not have all the features it did when I initially penned this review, but the inexcusable waste of Windows 7 profits to release the Vista 2.0 that is 8 saddens me. It's not quality. And when the interior of the OS is rotten, there's only so much painting the outside edifice of the OS can do.

As a Windows 7 user in the post-Sinofsky era, I can attest to getting the supposedly Windows 8 exclusive of .NET Framework 4.5 in 4.5 SP1 implementation on Windows 7, thus showing that while Windows 8 may have more powerful hardware, you know the fusion of mobile and desktop means more apps running simultaneously and that means systems that had plenty of RAM for a compelling desktop experience in Windows 7 (witness this laptop) suddenly are getting out of memory errors with Windows 8-it's like trying to install Vista Home Basic (not Home Premium, because Home Premium has Aero which Windows 8 of any edition lacks because Microsoft felt it was ""obsolete"" when in reality I still measure a Windows XP or later computer's worth by ""Is it able to display Aero and do so with full 7 drivers?""

This laptop I am posting today's update on may not be much, but I wouldn't take the most popular HP laptop with 8 on Amazon for it, no matter how positive the reviews may be.

End Update 2-21-2014.

Update 2-27-2014:

I configured a spare 1TB hard drive in a $400 Gateway PC that had received a clean install of Windows 7 Home Premium from the Family Pack to be a remote network backup destination for my Windows 7 PCs (since the Time Capsule was designed primarily for Macs, which it's cross-platform support is not really there, at least as of the revision that was most compatible with my main Mac, even though it's 2008 vintage) and Windows 7 Professional is busy backing up along with Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade and full install on the other two main PCs, and I am surprised at how easy it was.

A similar update will be posted under Windows 7 Ultimate Full Install and Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade.

End Update 2-27-2014

Update 9-16-2013 (Critical Windows 9 Status Update):

Well, consider what I uncovered about the supposedly awesome Windows 9, that's supposed to ""replace"" 7:

I also heard that Windows 9 may look like Windows 7, but this mini-start menu (based on a Microsoft press photo) has Live Tiles where links to local computer items once stood in 7. Plus Aero is still out for lunch (defenders say skeumorphism is dead, I say long live skeumorphism!), and Microsoft ties your activation to the Windows Store, so that means that they have a much more swift and sure means of sending your computer into reduced functionality mode even if you have a truly legal key!

I want my computer being rendered illegal for a good reason (at least not for something trivial like Windows 9 allows for), not because I didn't buy enough apps from the Windows Store in a given day, week, month, or year. How are you supposed to use the Metro-limited Windows 9 when not using Metro apps early and often could be grounds for your computer to be rendered illegal according to Microsoft? In effect, they've made Metro mandatory and inaccessible, rather than optional (from the ability to legally use Windows point of view, not from the it's in your face while you're using it point of view) and far too readily accessible?

I'd rather have a minor bug, as critical as the bug in question may be to the use of the computer, in the form of bad UI, than a horrible show-stopping bug that makes Windows 8's UI crimes (awful as they might have been) seem minor!

I love that they're bringing back the Start button, but what they really needed to do was scrap the Windows Store and modern apps. Not make your computer depend on them but be unable to use them because it's a desktop (known as Win32) SKU. I'm sticking with Windows 7 and as soon as it's toast no more Internet for me. I would suggest you do the same.

End Update 9-16-2014 (Critical Windows 9 Status Update)",5
"Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade was bought because the school needed Windows 7 Enterprise EQUIVALENT software. Seeing as how one $220 copy of Windows 7 was going to outdistance an $2000 a year at minimum Software Assurance contract, I bought this for a laptop that was at one time (but NOT now) the third most powerful Windows 7 machine in the house. The MacBook Pro went for a variety of reasons (mostly relating to overheating running multiple things it should have been OH SO EASILY capable of), but the eMachines W3622 I had gotten for Christmas obliged me by running Windows 7 with Aero, thus allowing me to accomplish a Windows 7 general availabilty long goal of having three Windows 7 running computers.

Now granted, the best Windows 7 machine is also a Mac, running Snow Leopard in addition to Windows 7 Ultimate, and due to needs to keep it running only runs Windows 7 Ultimate RTM-Lion and Mountain Lion would over-stress it, and that we cannot allow, thus meaning that we have to run the RTM Windows 7 on it, but this laptop has exceeded my expectations with Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 upgrade. Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 upgrade upgrades Windows Vista Home Premium SP1 or SP2 directly, but since we had been loaning out the laptop, we decided to do the clean install and do not regret it, except for some user error on my part (forgot to save something important mainly.)

I never had a problem with Windows Vista Home Premium, but Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate on machines that support Aero is really a treat, giving the user the ultimate in compatibility, capability, and flexibility. Windows 8 I keep hearing won't even begin to compare, the least of which reasons is when clicking on the Desktop tile you don't get the fine grained system control Windows 7 gives.

I always say I want my desktop OS choices to be the best they can be for the desktops, and the mobile OS choices best for and on my PDAs, smartphones, and tablets-unless I have enough extra money to buy a Windows 7 tablet, in which case I view it as an alternative option to a traditional clamshell laptop or netbook.

I want Windows 7, because Microsoft's marketing was proved true from my experiences with the release candidate all the way to fully updated Windows 7 RTM and SP1 today. Windows 8 seems like a giant step backwards, one which I do not appreciate.

5 stars, even with SP1. Without it it's 10 stars. (I happen to know what the RTM was like, and it was awesome.)

Update 2-27-2014:

As posted on my Windows 7 Ultimate Full Install and Windows 7 Professional Upgrade pages, I had a desktop with OEM Windows 7 Home Premium that I hedged my bets with by assigning it a dispensation from my Windows 7 Home Premium Family Pack, and up until a few days ago I didn't have legal Office to go along with the retail Windows 7 Upgrade install. So I was considering my options but the reviews on Windows 8, even from those who rated it highly, indicated that you might have issues and I didn't need issues, I needed software that would approach the ""just works"" of the Classic Mac OS. So I sat there, installed Office 2003 off of a spare copy I picked up, and then suddenly I was set. I had no reason to consider Windows 8 for this Windows 7 OEM PC any further, and so I set up the second 1TB hard drive to backup this copy of Windows 7 as well as Windows 7 Ultimate Full Install and Windows 7 Professional Upgrade and it went so smoothly. I am thrilled that I have a supported way out of the backup dilemma, compared to buying OEM Windows Home Server 2011 and losing use of the PC as a general-purpose desktop.

Needless to say, I got everything I wanted out of Windows 7 Ultimate (both copies) and Professional, and I'm happy.

Update 1-14-2015:

I am recently availing myself of the opportunity to tear Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade 64-bit with SP1 on hardware that was midrange for 2011 by complementing my Sandy Bridge desktop with a laptop, I have to say even with all of the Windows 8 features that were loaded into Windows 7 to make up for the fact that people didn't automatically do whatever it took to go to Windows 8, it still feels so much more like Windows 7 than Lion does (the equivalent Mac OS X version) when you install all the updates, and is a key reason why I gave up my Intel iMac for a newer if lower-end PC laptop, because I wanted to be able to update my OS and have it still feel like the stock version. Apple wouldn't give me that, so I went to Windows 7,

After I uninstalled a duplicate of an update that was part of Internet Explorer 11, Windows 7 installed and updated with the greatest of ease, and it provides me with a better experience than Lion or Yosemite on contemporary or newer Macs. Windows 7 may not have been perfect, but to me I couldn't tell the difference, and I'm using it on the best hardware I've ever used it on as proof.

Windows 7 you definitely should get the Ultimate Edition of it if you can, because it's better than Windows 8 Pro with Media Center, I find it's better than Windows 8.1 or Windows 8.1 Update 1, and due to a desire to turn Windows 9 into another Windows 8 style flop (but this time with a Live Tile-encrusted Start menu) is going to keep me on Windows 7 unless I go Mac, and like I said Lion and X.10 Yosemite have failed with Safari 6 and later, due to a huge combination of factors.

Get Windows 7 of Ultimate Edition and stick to it no matter what. I liked Windows 10 as of the Technical Preview Build 9879, but I so much won't like it as of RTM, and even as of the Technical Preview it would only be on a second hard disk opposite Windows 7, & only then if I could know I could readily go back and forth to Windows 7 for tasks I don't want to do on 8 and later, or especially Win 10 and later.

"I got this product for a netbook that later died, but I owned it long enough to know I wish I had not sent it off with the netbook that needed repairs. This product (I bought it in April of 2010, while it still was the non-SP1 version) was an answer to prayer because it removed all the OEM bloatware-bloating from a netbook running Windows 7 Starter, and it's transferrable should the netbook die but you hold onto the software.

Windows 8 doesn't seem magical or revolutionary to me, and the iPad lost it's magical and revolutionary feeling when I had to either upgrade it or give up on the whole idea. So that brought me back to Windows 7, and even though I lost my copy of Windows 7 of this product type, it was worth every penny and I don't know how much more.

I am most likely going to buy another one to replace the one I lost, because this operating system is (to this humble reviewer) the as perfect as possible version of Vista, which while I sympathize with those who spent heavily on the Vista idea only to have them fix and replace it for nearly the same price, I can honestly say that I had no hardware that could run Vista until late 2008,whereas with Windows 7's lighter touch I had three systems from the get-go that could run that OS choice.

If you have a multitude of PCs and can get it legal, I would recommend the Family Pack, but if you can't, I recommend this product as a backup option, even if you have to buy 5 or 6 copies of it.

This is simply something that will most likely never come again. Grab it while you can.

Update 1/15/2013: I did indeed buy another copy of it, this one with SP1 from the get go, and counting my Windows 7 Home Premium Famuly Pack Upgrade, I can now have Windows 7 on up to 7 PCs of the 2007 to 2011 stripes, and life is great for me. I know this is expensive, but Windows 7 makes your computer life easier compared to Windows 8, unless of course you love Windows 8-in which case I don't want to deny you your choice.

I just know that I can have 7 computers all on one HomeGroup, have a Start menu that isn't a world unto itself, have a browser that isn't broken by a feature Microsoft intended to make up for the increasing Orwelliam aspects of Windows 8 but that websites don't want to work with because the ads that make the Internet free depend on that feature being unavailable or at worst ineffective. Google ""Do Not Track in Internet Explorer 10"" to find out more.

Update 1/22/2013:

Here it is, 3 years and 3 months exactly to the day that Windows 7 was released, and since I didn't want to experience the stress of putting an old MacBook from 2007 through Vista (but I DID own a legal copy of it, which covers my you-know-what if Microsoft later tries to say I upgraded illegally) I did the install Windows 7, play around in it, erase the hard disk, reinstall Windows 7, and it activated perfectly. Of course, since I was doing the clean install thing, I had to re-import my programs, files, and settings from other computers on my HomeGroup, but I have done all that and it went smooth as silk.

Unlike with Windows 8, I do not feel like I wasted my money on any of my 7 copies of Windows 7, regardless of the limitations Home Premium may have compared to Professional or Ultimate. (Of course it helps when 3 PCs were upgraded using the Windows 7 Family Pack, but that is something else entirely.

As to the disappointment some people voiced in libraries versus a concrete storage location, I think that you should have the libraries but have all the folders in a library be physically anchored within the library structure so that files are not being copied from mysterious library locations but instead are being copied from whatever physical folder is the part of the library from which the file you eant to copy to the destination PC is located in.

"I've been using Windows 7 since its beta release, but my laptop's been running the final version for weeks now. I really disliked Vista and preferred XP still, but Windows 7 has tipped the scales...finally. Windows 7 has been reliable and it's snappier than Vista.  Windows 7 sips laptop battery power so my 1-year-old Dell XPS M1530 runs longer under Win7 than it did under Vista.  But what I really like about Windows 7 are the new and improved features it offers. Here's a list of my favorites:

#1 VIRTUAL LIBRARIES
With virtual libraries, the special folders like Documents, Pictures, Music and Videos have all become libraries. Instead of being a physical storage location, they're indexes that point to one or many locations on the computer you're using, as well as other computers you're networked with. In a home setting, where you're running Windows Home Server, you can now easily direct file stores to your server.  Also in the home, housemates can easily see each others' data by including their respective folders in one another's libraries. When you search a library, you're searching your computer and any other computer that has folders you've added to your library.  You determine which physical location will be the default location for saving new files to your library.  This is, for me, the single best feature of Windows 7, and is an excellent reason to upgrade.

#2 START SEARCH
The Start Search has been improved in Windows 7 so results appear instantly as soon as you click the Start button, and then either type the name of a program on your computer, or a task you'd like to perform (like, ""change my display settings""). No more hunting folder hierarchies to find that elusive program, or spend time figuring out where Microsoft has placed something in the Control Panel. This is a tremendous time-saver.

#3 AERO SNAP
The Aero user interface has three new tricks -- Shake, Peek, and Snap -- but only Aero Snap is a major leap forward. Have you ever tried comparing the contents of two windows together, side-by-side? It's painful to do because you have to fiddle with resizing the two windows. With Aero Snap, now all you do is grab the title bar of one window, sling it to the left, and Windows 7 will automatically resize the window to fill-up one-half of your screen display. Do the same with a 2nd window by slinging it to the right, and it'll fill-up the right-side of your display. You can start comparing two windows in...an Aero Snap. Aero Shake and Peek are cute, but not nearly so helpful.

#4 TASKBAR
Gone is the Quick Launch bar that too many people didn't know existed. Now, the whole Taskbar is a quick launch bar -- drag and drop any program icon onto the bar, and you're one click away from starting the program. Also, it's so easy to move the taskbar around now. I keep it on the left vertical on my computer. Gone is the system tray, too -- Notification Area takes its place. The Action Center alerts you to anything you need to do to keep your computer working smoothly.

#5 PROGRAM COMPATIBILITY
Any program can be run in one of many compatibility modes now. Windows 7 has a wizard that will help you pick the right, earlier version of Windows under which to run an older program -- just right-click on the program icon and choose ""Troubleshoot Compatibility"". Or, You can do the same thing more quickly by right-clicking on a program icon, click the Compatibility tab, enable Compatibility mode, and select the earlier version of Windows you want to run with your program.

#6 STICKY NOTES
Less functional that the Vista Sticky Notes -- which nobody used -- but now I actually use Sticky Notes to put reminders on my Desktop. They're quick, easy, and work just like a regular Post-It note only you don't get fingerprints on your screen!

#7 JUMP LISTS
There are two kinds -- Jump lists that let you quickly pick a task to perform, and Jump lists to quickly select a document to open and edit in the associated program. Jump lists include most recently used files, or you can pin your own files, too.  These are nice time-savers.

#8 SAVED SEARCHES
In Windows Explorer, you can create filtered searches and then save them in your Favorites for later use. This is handy to find filtered data in the future. When you re-execute the search, it creates a dynamic results set (so your search is never stale).

#9 CONTENT VIEW & ARRANGING
Also in Windows Explorer, two new features. Now you can arrange a folder into subdivisions by date (great for your pictures folders!). You can use the Content view to combine thumbnails of files along with details that usually are found only in the Details view.

#10 USER ACCOUNT CONTROL
Most everyone hated UAC in Vista (even though it helped to keep your computer safe). In Windows 7, Microsoft tamped down the annoyance factor of UAC. You can change your date and time without setting off UAC, for example. You can also decide whether UAC should go into secured Desktop mode whenever it does get triggered (secured Desktop is when your screen darkens and you're forced to respond to UAC's dialog box asking permission to run a program or make a change to your system). You can easily turn-off UAC, too.

#11 PAINT, WORDPAD, CALCULATOR
All three of these utilities got updated. Wordpad and Paint have the Office-like ""ribbon"" now, and Calculator has a few new memory keys, touch sensitivity, and a Programmer view for those dealing with hexidecimals and binaries.

#12 HOMEGROUP SHARING
This is the easiest way to share data with others in your (home) network. HomeGroup creates a password that is shared among computers, and that takes care of all the issues with user accounts, file permissions and ""access denied"" problems. This is great for unsophisticated home networks.  I made this feature last because I'm not using it -- I just think it's a great idea for inexperienced users.  Note:  all the networked computers need to be running Windows 7 to make HomeGroup sharing work.

Upgrading advice:  I went through the upgrade process twice.  Here's what I learned to do before and after the upgrade:  1)  Remove Adobe Reader and reinstall the latest version (9.2 as I write this) after the upgrade.  Older versions of Reader won't render correctly in Windows 7 and an IE8 browsing session.  2) Remove your antivirus, anti-malware and anti-spyware programs, and reinstall them after the upgrade using the latest versions available.  3)  Remove any virtualization programs (like VMWare Workstation) and reinstall following the upgrade.  4)  After the upgrade, look for the latest video driver from the video card maker, not by your computer hardware vendor (in my case, it was getting a new driver from Nvidia rather than from Dell).

Looking to do a clean install using this upgrade disk?  You can, but here's how.  Insert the DVD and choose ""Custom"" to do the clean install.  During the install, DO NOT enter your product id or activate Windows -- yet.  Instead, you'll finish the clean install, reboot, then use your DVD to do an upgrade of the clean install of Windows 7.  Yes, you're upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 7.  After you upgrade, then enter your product id and activate Windows.  I haven't tried this out personally, but others have and have done so successfully.  Add a comment to my review to share your experience if you go this route.  Final note:  This tip isn't intended to circumvent the stipulations in the licensing agreement for upgrading your computer.  If you're not entitled to upgrade (because, say, you're using Windows 95, 98, 2000, or ME), then you must buy the full version.  As I tell my kids, ""Just because you can do a thing doesn't mean you should do a thing.""  :-)

And finally, my few quibbles with Windows 7:  My Dell XPS M1530 has always had sporadic issues resuming from a sleep or hibernate state under Vista.  That still is the case, even with Windows 7.  I'm not convinced, though, that the underlying problem is an operating system issue as much as a hardware/BIOS problem, so I can't knock Windows 7 for this problem.  Not all my laptops have had similar power-on problems, even under Vista, so my advice to you is to NOT expect Windows 7 to solve any power-on problems from a sleep or hibernate state if you've currently got those problems with your laptop.

Lastly, if you like to periodically examine the Reliability Monitor in Vista, it's not as nice in Windows 7 -- there is no precise data value assigned to your machine's ever-changing reliability metric.  And it's impossible to find in the Control Panel (but it's easy to do a Start Search on).  The graph is still there, though, and it's updated hourly instead of daily.  For most people, I'm guessing this is a complete non-issue.

In short, think of Windows 7 as Windows Vista done right.",5
"Bottom-Line: Microsoft continues to improve its premiere messaging application; for me ""Outlook 2010"" is (still) the contact management program for me and remains the best on the market, period!

So, I have been working with Microsoft Office 2010 for the last seven or so months on three different computer platforms all running Windows 7 Enterprise Edition.  I use ""Microsoft Outlook 2010"" every day; it is one of the first applications I open in the morning and one of the last I close in the evening, so I am very familiar with the program and it functionality.

""Outlook 2010"" (the software can also be purchased separately), is the (Office) suite's business and personal communications/collaboration client for connecting to Microsoft Exchange, or external Internet based POP3 email providers like Yahoo Mail, Hotmail, Gmail, etc.

But, ""Outlook 2010"" is also a very robust (stand-a-lone) contact manager allowing one  to schedule meeting, create a To-Do Task List, keep track of Contacts, create Notes, and keep a running record of documents and emails sent and or received via Outlook Journal.  From very humble beginnings, Microsoft has turned Outlook into the must-have Contact Manager.

The first thing you'll notice about ""Outlook 2010"" is the new multi-colored splash screen on startup. This new yellow, orange, and red splash screen is common across all other Office Products as well.  But the (rounded) splash screen also relays information about what the product is doing during the load process; not that anyone will understand the verbiage.  But, for techies like me it looks cool!

Once ""Outlook 2010"" starts you will be greeted with a much smoother user interface with much smoother fonts and edges, as well as a more subtle color theme and an operational ribbon bar transplanted from the rest of the Office Suite.  Anyone familiar with Office 2007 will be right at home with the new Ribbon motif in Outlook 2010; Outlook 2007 was not so adorned.

All of the menu items in previous versions of Outlook have been moved to the Ribbon along with many new tasks/options.  All of these changes blend in nicely with Microsoft's upcoming Windows 7 operating system, but might take some getting used to for those not familiar with the Office Ribbon Bar.

Overall the layout of the interface remains unchanged from that of Outlook 2007.  However, the Inbox and the Sent Items Folder has been moved to the top of the folder list in the Folder List View, while there is more space between the folders.  User created mailbox folders are now pushed down below the Default Outlook Folders.  Nothing too radical, but the new Inbox location took me a little getting used to.

What Else is New?

64-Bit Performance: Perhaps the largest change to Office 2010 suite is the availability of both a 32-bit and 64-bit version of the suite.  This of course translates to better memory and processor usage, resulting in better performance throughout.

Conversation view has been added to Outlook 2010 much to the delight of fans of third-party email clients like Gmail. If an e-mail comes in that's a reply to the original message, any related messages to that particular subject line are displayed with it.  The default view is collapsed, but all of the messages in the conversation string, including the original sent mail and replies, can be displayed with a simple click of the mouse.

Forwarding a message as an attachment or Text Message now has a home in the form of a designated button(s) on the (Respond) section on the Home tab of the ribbon bar. Click on the button and a new email comes up with the selected message already as an attachment. Note: this feature will also work with multiple messages.  Note: in order to send a Text Message, you'll need to set up the service first.

Quick Steps is a fantastic new feature in ""Outlook 2010.""  Outlook Quick Steps--accessible via the Quick Steps section of the Home Ribbon bar--allow you to create shortcuts for various actions like automatically replying to a selected message and deleting, and or filing the original, or forwarding a message to a specific person, group of people, or even department.  And quick steps can even be assigned keyboard shortcuts.  Outlook 2010 includes a number of default Quick Steps, and new ones are very easy to create.

Voice-Mail Integration is now offered with Outlook 2010 and is used in conjunction with Exchange 2010 and Microsoft Office Communications Server (OCS) 2007 R2.  This feature creates an easy to use multi-media interface for playing back voice-mail messages.

HTML Rending Issues

Microsoft first started using Word to render the HTML content in Outlook 2007.
Microsoft has kept MS Word as the rending engine for creating HTML e-mails much to the chagrin of a large number of users who complain that Microsoft should a more industry standard engine.  MS Word, they say, does an incomplete job of rendering HTML graphics and text and a highly caustic campaign has been started via a website called Fixoutlook.org and is being supported by the Email Standards Project. The campaign claims to have more than 19,000 participants.

But Microsoft recently reaffirmed that is plans to move ahead with Word as the rendering engine in ""Outlook 2010.""  This was confirmed in a recent BLOG post by William Kennedy, Microsoft's Corporate VP for Office Communications and Forms.

Kennedy wrote ""Word has always done a great job of displaying the HTML which is commonly found in e-mails around the world. For e-mail viewing, Word also provides security benefits that are not available in a browser. Word cannot run web script or other active content that may threaten the security and safety of our customers.""

He went on to state: ""the 'Email Standards Project' does not represent a sanctioned standard or an industry consensus in this area. Should such a consensus arise, we will of course work with other e-mail vendors to provide rich support in our products.""

Personally, I have never had a problem creating or displaying HTML messages in Outlook 2007, nor have I had an issue with Outlook 2010 thus far, so I cannot relate.

Enough said.

My Thoughts

""Outlook 2010"" as a standalone application does not represent a huge a huge leap forward in the areas of contact management, Email communications, or scheduling.  But, when integrated with MS Exchange 2010 and MS OCS 2007, the program offers a wealth of new functionality in an enterprise setting.  Although the interface may look the same as Outlook 2007, this faade is somewhat deceptive, because underneath the skin lies a swift new program able to speak in 32, or 64-Bit computing.

However, despite the robust enterprise pedigree Outlook 2010 is perfectly fine for the standalone user, and or small office setting utilizing POP3 or HTML based mail.  The ability to install and run the 64-Bit version of the software is incentive enough for me to want to trade-up.  And while some may find the new Ribbon Bar intimidating (hey even I had to get used to it), given time it will prove a time-saver.  HTML rendering aside, Microsoft continues to improve its premiere messaging application; for me ""Outlook 2010"" is (still) the contact management program for me and remains the best on the market, period!",5
"Dragon NaturallySpeaking's ability to recognize and properly interpret spoken words within the context they are spoken makes it a useful tool when it comes to dictation (speech to text), controlling a Windows computer, interacting with applications such as Internet Browsers and search engines, the Microsoft Office suite of apps and, through proper customization, just about any Windows app.

After a couple of weeks of experiencing the Dragon, words that come to mind to describe my impressions would be: well-thought, mature, polished, complex, depth, cutting edge, features rich, trainable, expandable, artificially intelligent, versatile. Closer runner-ups would be: essential, time-saver, productivity enhancer, precise, breakthrough - and I may be able to validate these and move them into the first tier of descriptors eventually but a couple more months of daily use may be needed.

I am using the Dragon with my email (Outlook and Gmail), text messengers such as Microsoft's Communicator, producing quick drafts and with some internet Browser (Chrome) activities such as navigating inside the active tab (page up/down), switching tabs and quick Google and Wikipedia searches. Also some interaction with the Operating System such as opening/closing apps, saving docs and so on. But, of course, there's a lot more to the Dragon than what I am using it so I will provide what will hopefully be a brief overview based on my own experience.

OPERATION

Dragon works is by listening to your spoken words and trying to make sense of what it hears. If it decides that the words were a 'command', the Dragon decides whether the command concerns the Dragon itself or whether it has to do with the Operating System or the foreground application. Then the command is executed. Otherwise, the Dragon listens to the stream of spoken words and identifies words based on context, statistics of past word usage, custom vocabulary, user-provided training, user profile data, etc., etc. Once the words are identified, the output is produced based on yet another set of rules.

SETTING UP THE DRAGON

The initial setup was not exactly 'quick' but the no-nonsense thoroughness actually persuaded me that I was dealing with a serious, mature, well-thought piece of software.

One of Setup's first steps is to identify an 'audio source' and Dragon supports most audio inputs a PC supports: USB, Bluetooth, a microphone or a digital recorder plugged into the Line-in jack, sound files, a Pocket PC device used as a digital recorder.

After the audio source is identified, the user will specify his/her age, location (US, NZ, Australia, UK, India, SE Asia...), accent (standard American, Middle America, Southern, Indian, Australian, UK...).

Then, training begins. Volume and the audio equipment quality is tested, then the user is asked to read a specific test. To further enhance its word-guessing capabilities the Dragon then ask for permission to take a look at the user's text documents (My Docs) and emails.

This completes the initial setup.

TRAINING THE DRAGON

As suspected, the setup is just the beginning. To improve word recognition accuracy, the user is expected to constantly fine-tune the application or rather the profile that the Dragon creates for the user.

There are user-initiated tasks such as adding-removing words from Dragon's written form/spoken form vocabulary listing, by asking the Dragon to take a look at more documents or emails, creating simple new commands that can be universal or application specific or using a full-fledged scripting language to produce more complex outputs from word commands. The user can also train the Dragon on specific words by speaking the word into the microphone and providing the associated spelling.

In addition, the Dragon has the ability to learn and improve its accuracy by periodically reviewing its past activities - there are several tasks that do that periodically while the user-focused portion of the Dragon is not running.

RIDING THE DRAGON

I confess that I was highly skeptical before trying this out. I expected a low word recognition rate, an unacceptable degradation in my laptop's performance and apps freezing or crashing while the Dragon was on.  I was proven wrong on all of the above.

My very first few sentences spoken into the Dragon were recognized 100% - I suppose the Dragon struggles hard to make a good first impression. Ever since, the Dragon's ability to recognize my commands as commands and execute them and to properly interpret my words stayed high enough. I am now comfortable to use the Dragon on all my casual emails (Gmail) and on my office emails (I do check before I say 'send' and I do enter the 'to' and 'cc' names manually), on all my instant text messages and on 'first draft' office documents.

Again, surprisingly, my computer did slow down appreciably with the Dragon on. This is only my subjective impression because Task Manager tells me that Dragon does take 30-60% of CPU while in listening mode. The good news is that it's easy to turn the Mic off when Dragon is not needed and then Dragon's CPU usage drops to 3-4%.

And there is no significant bad interaction with other apps that I'm aware of. I running the Dragon on a Windows 7, dual-CPU Thinkpad T40 and I haven't detected any 'new' problems following the Dragon installation.

THE DRAGON TRAINING/RIDING YOU

The Dragon does a lot to make itself useful and helpful. There is an optional sidebar that lists the most common commands available within the current context or you just say 'what can I say?' and the available commands show up, 'Help' pops up whenever you say 'give me Help', a brief tutorial with examples covers most activities, there is a Web site... and so on.

While the above paragraph could have fit under the Dragon Riding section and it's true that many serious apps provide that kind of help, the Dragon is unique in its training its users into gradually modifying the way their minds work. It's a gradual process but the fact that the longer the spoken piece is - the Dragon tries to make sense of what you said whenever you 'pause' - the more accurate the Dragon is at guessing what your really meant to say. In other words, the Dragon is gently training you into speaking in complete, well-structured sentences.

Speaking for myself, being the fast touch typist that I am, I tend to type first and complete my thought later - because I can quickly erase/rephrase my text. This approach does not work well with the Dragon - it's possible to correct and modify a text but it's not efficient. Like I said, I am currently comfortable with using the Dragon for quick emails and messages but not for 'serious' documents. I do notice that my Dragon-dictation skills are improving and more of my soundbytes are complete sentences.

MY RATING

The Dragon is one of the few pieces of computer software within this price range that does something useful and it does it intelligently. You can't have a conversation with the software the way you would with a typing clerk or a computer operator but, as the software evolves (I am reviewing Version 11) and as our little computers get faster and more capable, the Dragon seems to be very much on the path to that level of interactivity.

The way it is now, I will continue to use the Dragon. I don't expect for everybody to love it or 'like' it because it really depends. It does require some significant time investment to make it work well and... read the 'Dragon Riding You' section above. I personally like/love this software and, therefore, MY rating is a 5-star but, if I can recommend anything, it would be 'try it before you buy it'.

P.S. - I did NOT test Dragon's interaction with sound files or digital voice recorders.

"There are a lot more features in this software bundle than I realized at first.  My main interest was in the video software because I wanted to make some short movies and be able to save them to different formats such as Youtube or to be viewed on a TV with a DVD.  This software helps you to capture, edit and then share your movies from your video camcorder, mobile device, USB camera or other movies or clips you have on your computer. When you start it up you see a timeline where you can capture your video or move it from a file on your computer.  There you can edit things like titles, fonts, sound, themes and the order in which your movie clips play.  You can also do slideshows or a combination of still shots and movie clips.  It's easy to do a simple movie, dragging around the clips in the timeline and adding written info or voice-overs to the different clips.  When you're finished you can save it in a variety of different size files and formats or upload to Youtube or Vimeo.  (I've never tried Vimeo).

I found the program very user friendly although a little slow at times.  There is a learning curve if you want to get into more than just the basic things.  There is a manual that comes with it but in my experience, just spending the time playing around with it was the way to go.  It's easy to make a quick movie that you can export to your mobile phone or burn to a DVD or upload to an internet site. You can also take more time and do something really creative, but still with all the bells and whistles that make it pretty painless. For example you can modify the playback speed, multi trim your video, enhance the color, brightness or sound or even add overlay clips. The software came with a manual of 213 pages of good instruction including photos of the different screens. I was also impressed with the section, including pictures, of the equipment and cables you need to connect a camcorder or other device to your computer in order to import movies. It makes it easy for the beginning filmmaker to get started. I had already installed a firewire card on this computer but even if I hadn't installed one before, the instructions, along with photos would have made it easy to do.

Like all video programs that I've used, this is really a memory hog and I sometimes experienced slowness or stalls for a few minutes when I was trying to do something.  I don't think any video app in this price range is without it's quirks and this doesn't have any more or less than other such programs.  It suits my purposes for home movies or videos to share on the internet.

Both the video and photo applications come with user manuals.  I thought they were helpful in getting me started and then the rest was mostly intuitive.  I've used other video and photo editing software, so I'm not completely new to this type of program.  I think if you've never used this type of software before you have to plan on spending some time using it and trying the different features.  I tend to learn and remember things that I use often and then look up or experiment with new features that I haven't tried before.  There is a lot more here than most people would ever need.

The Photo Editing software is also included in the bundle. Overall I like using this program.  It has lots of great editing features that are typical in this type of program, plus a few that are unique.  Using Express Lab is a great way to make quick changes to photos without having to go through a lot of steps or a learning curve.  I especially like the ""suntan brush"" feature in the ""Makeover"" section.  It transforms your cursor into a nice little brush that is like using a self-tanning cream to make the people in your photo look like they spent the afternoon on the beach playing volleyball.  OK, so you now look like you were out in the sun all day, but the exercise part is missing and you still look a little pudgy?  Use the ""Thinify"" feature and you look like you sweated off a couple pounds while you were getting that suntan.  And you use the cursor to specify which people get the magic weight loss treatment so your big fat cousin stays just the way he is!  Well, the tool's not perfect because it makes your head thinner too, and then it looks kind of bizarre, but if you just want to do a little tweaking it's kind of a cool feature.

Another fun feature of in the ""Makeover"" section is the ""Toothbrush"" feature.  You haven't used those whitener strips on your teeth in some time and all the coffee and tea makes your teeth look a little dingy in that close-up photo?  Just click on the ""Toothbrush"" button and point your cursor at those pearly whites and they become, well, pearly white!  Yeah, you could do the same thing with a paintbrush in Photoshop or even in the main section of this program, but you'd have to be careful that you didn't whiten the spaces between your teeth or your lips since you don't want to look really strange.  This program knows not to do that and just whitens the teeth.  Eyes a little red?  The ""Eye drop"" feature takes care of that with a click on the mouse.

Want to make your photo look like like one from 1839?  Use the ""Time Machine"" feature under ""Photo Effects"" and you can change your photo from today to look as though it were created anywhere from 1839 to the 60's and choose the camera it was ""taken"" with to a box camera or other special effects.  Of course you always have the black and white or sepia options.  It has tons of other features, these are just a few.  I'm looking forward to using it to create some 12 x 12 inch digital scrapbook pages.

I love using this program for a quick fix on photos and also for it's ability to organize all of my pictures.  The things I don't like are that it's a memory hog and sometimes runs somewhat slow on my Pentium 2 Ghz computer running Windows XP with 2 GB of ram.  It's not terrible or anything, just a little slow to load and sometimes doesn't execute commands instantly.  I also find the program not to be very intuitive on some features, but that could be because I've been using Photoshop and Photoshop Elements in the past and am used to those programs.  I'd still recommend this program to anyone who likes touching up or doing creative things with photos.

This bundle also includes Corel Painter Essentials 4.  With this program you can take any photo and do all sorts of special effects such as making it look like an old oil painting, a charcoal drawing, a line drawing, chalk drawing and many many more.  I've spent hours playing with this and trying different combinations of brushes and tones.  Some results were very good and others were pretty so-so.  I would say that pictures of scenery seem to turn out better than close ups of people's faces.  It takes a while to render each photo on my computer but it's fun to watch.

All in all, this software has a lot of features for the money, more than I'll probably ever have reason to use.  But it's kept me busy for many hours, most of them enjoyable.  It's not perfect, but I think it's a good deal.",5
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:
 Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!

I originally started using Corel's VideoStudio software beginning with version X2.  With this X4 version, Corel continues to add new features and useful enhancements, important bug fixes and crucial improvements to software stability, along with performance and speed boosts by taking advantage of Intel's and AMD's new CPUs and also GPU acceleration provided by specific Nvidia graphics processors.  One really cool performance feature offered by VideoStudio is that it has a ""Smart Proxy"" editing mode, where you can edit high-definition video in a low-resolution mode, thereby allowing you to use a slower computer without necessarily slowing down to a sluggish crawl.  These performance enhancements offer a huge advantage because many of us do not upgrade our computers frequently with the latest fastest CPU processors.  So some of the other brands of video editing software may be unbearably slow on these slower computers (even to the point of completely freezing up) while VideoStudio X4 can still zip along with a decent amount of responsiveness on slower computers.

Even though I do not like how Corel has organized the user interface layout for their PaintShop Pro X4 photo-editing software, I continue to like the changes and improvements that they have made to this VideoStudio X4.  I can resize, drag, dock, and undock various windows and UI elements to suit my workspace preferences and everything seems to behave intuitively.  But as with how Corel has designed their help system for PaintShop Pro X4 software, the one aspect of the VideoStudio X4 user interface that I really dislike is that to access the help menus, I am forced to hop through intermediate menus before it launches the online help from Corel's Web site using my browser.  With both PaintShop Pro X4 and VideoStudio X4, I now just bookmark the help information URLs and access them directly from my browser instead of clicking the cumbersome help button from within the application.  Even though the latest and most up-to-date online help information can be dynamically accessed directly from Corel's Web site when using this browser approach, I would still really prefer the previous approach of at least being given the option during the installation of the software to load the full help documentation on my computer's local hard drive since that also gives me the freedom to access the user manuals and help guides when I use the software without having Internet access.

I had fun using the new time-lapse photography feature.  I used a Canon Timer Remote Controller TC-80N3 to shoot a series of timer-delayed photos of the sun setting behind the mountains and another cool every-two-minutes photo series that I made last summer of a morning glory vine slowly opening up its blooms, and then I used the VideoStudio X4's time-lapse photography feature to create a video from both of these photo series that look like a sped-up time-lapse movie.  If both videos had been recorded as real-time videos, they would have been mind-numbingly boring to watch, but when sped up using the time-lapse feature, they allow everyday people like me to showcase the wonders of nature just like how the professional movies and television nature programs use time-lapse photography.

The software lets me use both standard definition and HD videos, and editing, authoring, and burning of both video types is easy.  The software is very flexible in importing videos from your hard drive or capturing them directly from your video recorders.  There are flexible options for viewing your files in different ways such as timeline or storyboard modes, which are useful for adding videos, pictures, text, audio and music tracks.  You can also trim or split your video into sections for better continuity, adding transitions and enhancing with many kinds of built-in effects.  Once you upload your video, you can trim and divide the video into clips.  Trimming is marking the beginning and ending of an entire clip, while multi-trimming is useful to divide one segment into multiple clips.  Multi-trimming is very useful for editing out various parts of a recorded video to exclude sections that are boring or extraneous.  This software's trimming functions are powerful and very easy to use, allowing me to feel like a Hollywood film director while I edit my videos to make them flow seamlessly between different scenes.

As with previous versions of VideoStudio, you can import photos to create a photo slideshow along with adding text and music accompaniment.  The software is very flexible for adding music or audio voiceovers to your video projects from a variety of sources.  You can add audio to your projects in Corel VideoStudio X4 using various methods such as adding audio files to the library from your hard drive, ripping music from a CD, or recording a voiceover clip.  You can edit the audio clips using a built-in sound mixer to adjust the volume, length and duration, fade-in/fade-out, and apply various mixing and sound filter effects to the audio tracks.  The video editor does limit you to six overlay video tracks along with your main video track, combined with up to two title tracks, a voice track, and three music tracks.  While this is less than some video-editing software that lets you incorporate many dozens of tracks, it is more than sufficient for the vast majority of everyday users (like me) who mainly work with personal videos and it is sufficient even for editing important events like videos of weddings and vacations.

After you have finished editing your video masterpiece, you can export in a variety of common formats including FLV files for YouTube, MPG (MPEG-1/MPEG-2), AVCHD, WMV HD, Windows Media, RealMedia, AVI, and QuickTime.  You also have the option to upload your work to Vimeo, Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube.  The software can create menus for DVD, Blu-ray, AVCHD, and it offers eight Blu-ray and twelve DVD menu choices.  This X4 version also adds new 3D video capabilities.  Even though I admit that I am a 3D video editing newbie, this feature seems limited and fairly rudimentary in its 3D rendering options, but it can create some pretty cool eye-popping 3D effects and is easy to use.  This will NOT get you the kind of 3D video that Hollywood can create, but it does add another dimension of ""eye candy Wow factor"" to your videos...  Just don't expect to create your own version of an ""Avatar 3D"" movie.  3D glasses are included with the software.

This is a big complex software application that really requires some patience for you to slowly become more familiar with all of its features and power.  But its user interface is cleanly designed so that newbie first-timers can start editing their videos with ease without fully mastering all of its powerful features.  Fortunately, Corel also provides plenty of online help along with easy-to-use templates and more than 60 really cool special effects and more than 150 transition effects to let you experiment and try out many of its flexible options so even video-editing newbies can create a polished slick video with ease.  The software uses a nondestructive editing approach so that your original video file is not being directly modified along the way.  This also allows you to experiment, even trying out wacky ideas and special effects, turning a tedious chore into a fun playtime of creating video eye candy.

Back when I was using VideoStudio X2, the software had various erratic and quirky bugs and serious stability issues; it can be disheartening to have the software freeze up after you have spent more than an hour editing a video.  Many of these problems have thankfully been resolved in this version X4; not once did I encounter a freeze-up or crash during my edits using X4.  When used on an older slower Windows Vista laptop of mine, the software can be sluggishly slow sometimes, but I prefer dealing with slower performance on a slower computer than having to deal with annoying software bugs and applications that freeze up or crash on me, so I accept the fact that I have to wait longer when using VideoStudio X4 on a slower laptop that is more than four years old.  As with any video editing software, especially when editing HD videos, your best experience will result from using a fast computer with lots of memory.  While this VideoStudio X4 lacks some of the features and has more track-editing limitations when compared to both CyberLink PowerDirector and Adobe Premiere, I think that it beats those two when it comes to multi-trim clip editing, key framing, and its best-in-class stop-motion and time-lapse animation capabilities.  And VideoStudio X4 is far easier and more intuitive to learn for a newbie compared to Adobe Premiere's dense complexity.  If this software was priced at $300, I would rate it 4 stars or maybe 3.5 stars, but with its inexpensive list price and Corel's frequent heavy pricing discounts, I rate it 5 stars because you really do get a lot of video editing bang for the buck here.  And if you are not technically adept, have some patience as you familiarize yourself with the software.

Also, Corel has released two important service pack patch updates for VideoStudio Pro X4.  After installing VideoStudio Pro on your computer, you can either download these large executable files from Corel's Web site, or from the user interface, click 'Help' and ""Check for Updates"" to download and install the service packs that way.",5
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:
 Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!

 Design & Features:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating
 Ergonomics, Usability & Ease of Use:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating
 Performance, Stability, Reliability:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating
 Competitive Pricing & Value:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating

 Positives:

 Many stability and performance issues from the previous X3 version were resolved in this X4 version.  It runs noticeably quicker, even on slower 5-year old laptops and small netbooks, with good stability.
 A very wide range of tools for both photo editing and graphic design, ranging from serious photography-specific tools to fun graphics manipulation.
 It combines photo editing, photo retouching, painting, drawing, graphics design, and image management in a single package.
 There are a great selection of photo enhancement tools, both to fix common photography issues and also more esoteric image manipulation tools.
 It also includes Web graphics tools for image mapping and slicing, and for coding image rollovers and Web button creation.
 Very affordable, yet very powerful; currently selling on Amazon at a heavily discounted pricing of less than $50.
 A very useful ""Learning Center"" and video tutorials help photo-editing newbies learn the software and accomplish common tasks.
 The user interface is divided into three tabs, ""Manage"", ""Adjust"", ""Edit"", providing a usable workflow from initial photo review to final editing, and allowing you to configure, customize, and save how you use each workspace.  You can also customize each toolbar individually.

 Negatives:

 Even though the new HDR ""Exposure Merge"" tool is a great start, the tool is not always precise at aligning objects between bracketed shots and it is especially lacking in deghosting; both problems can arise from either camera movement or movement of objects in the scene.
 It has limited RAW file processing capabilities and compatibilities compared to Adobe Lightroom, but Corel now intends for RAW handling to be better addressed in their new AfterShot Pro software.
 As with some of Corel's other recent products, accessing the help documentation requires access to Corel's online Web site for information, instead of being able to access all help documentation locally on my computer directly from within the application.
 Despite being more uncluttered and streamlined than the previous X3 version's user interface, the ""Edit"" tab of this new user interface, which serves as the main workhorse for serious image editing, is still somewhat cluttered and disorganized, with overlapping functions and ambiguous groupings of tools, and this impacts the ergonomics and usability of the software, especially for new users.
 For the graphics newbie who has no previous experience using graphics software, there is a medium-to-high learning curve effort required to learn how to proficiently use the software.  This software is not specifically designed for simple image manipulation by novices.  If you are initially learning this software, you should start off just using the ""Adjust"" tab and not use the ""Edit"" tab; the ""Adjust"" tab is simplified and suitable to novices whereas the ""Edit"" tab is meant for power users.

I have always been a fan of PaintShop Pro throughout the 1990s and I have often kept updating PSP versions after Corel acquired its original developer, JASC Software, in 2004, even though I also have been updating versions of CorelDRAW Graphics Suite starting from CorelDRAW 5.  Along with recently releasing the new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-AfterShot-Pro/dp/B006WVR9GY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel AfterShot Pro</a>&nbsp;this year (after Corel acquired Bibble Labs and repackaged their ""Bibble Pro"" as ""AfterShot Pro"") and also the newly updated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CorelDRAW-Graphics-Suite-X6/dp/B007IWCQ8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X6</a>, which includes Corel's original photo-editor called ""Photo-Paint"", Corel now has three photo applications which have some overlapping functions and also unique abilities of their own.  As a photo management application, AfterShot Pro is meant to complement PaintShop Pro and compete against Adobe Photoshop Lightroom.  I previously used both of Corel's PaintShop Pro and Corel's Photo-Paint software for photo editing, and even though recent versions of PaintShop Pro run slower than Photo-Paint due to code bloat from an ever-increasing set of features, PaintShop Pro remains my favorite ""Photoshop for the non-professional-graphics masses"" application, being more feature-packed and capable like Photoshop CS than Adobe's own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Photoshop-Elements-10/dp/B005MMMT6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Photoshop Elements 10</a>.

The PaintShop Pro X4 product features are described and rated below:

 Design & Features:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating:

 After Corel acquired JASC Software, they have been adding new features with each release, and even though this version runs and feels slower than earlier versions of PSP, I feel that it is a fair trade-off to allow the code bloat due to the number and complexity of features to slow the software down.  With this latest X4 version, I get a powerful set of photo and graphics editing tools that is more useful than Photoshop Elements 10.  PaintShop Pro X4 pales in comparison to the power of the full-blown Photoshop CS, but with its significantly lower pricing and learning curve compared to Photoshop CS, it is obviously meant to compete against software like Photoshop Elements, which it handily outperforms.  The rich set of tools included in PaintShop Pro range from very specific goal-oriented adjustments like the new ""Selective Focus"" tool that simulates the effect of tilt-shift lenses to tools that are very friendly to use by newbies such as 'One Step Photo Fix', 'Smart Photo Fix', and 'One Step Noise Removal'.  This ""Ultimate"" version of PaintShop Pro X4 adds even more power and value by including the award-winning Nik Color Efex Pro 3.0 photographic filters, which includes 52 photographic filters that can be applied to images to give them special effects.  Also included in this Ultimate version is a collection of ""Picture Tubes"", which are thematic collections of graphics that can be painted onto an image to add more bling to your images, frames, and borders.  To help you navigate through the plethora of tools and effects, a very useful 'Effect Browser' lets you try out the various effects, instead of accessing each effect one by one.  One thing that I noticed was that the dialog box window for the 'Effect Browser' has not been updated to match the stylish new user interface, and it still has the old Windows-expanding-folder-tree appearance of old PaintShop Pro versions.

 The new HDR (High Dynamic Range) ""Exposure Merge"" tool is Corel's foray into HDR software, which Adobe and other graphics software vendors are also incorporating into their tools.  HDR processing involves combining multiple exposures of the exact same shot (which is easier if your camera has an Automatic Exposure Bracketing (AEB) function) to create a high dynamic range photo which can display a higher tonal range than what the camera is capable of capturing in a single exposure.  There are various software specifically dedicated to HDR processing.  For the past four years, since version 3 in 2008, I have been using the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Photomatix-Pro-4/dp/B002CIP12U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Photomatix Pro 4</a>&nbsp;software for HDR processing.  On a relative scale specifically rating its HDR functions, I would rate Photomatix 5 fuzzy stars while this PaintShop Pro X4's new HDR ""Exposure Merge"" tool only gets 3 fuzzy stars rating.  Both Corel and Adobe still have a long way to catch up with the powerful and flexible offerings in Photomatix.  In particular, I found the ""Exposure Merge"" tool in this version of PaintShop Pro X4 to be lacking in its ability to precisely align bracketed photos and thoroughly and flexibly remove ghosting artifacts, which is something that Photomatix does a very good job at.  If you use a tripod-mounted camera to shoot bracketed photos where nothing in the scene moves the least bit, then the ""Exposure Merge"" tool consistently outputs good HDR results.  But when shooting portraits or landscapes, or shooting hand-held, bracketed photos often have misaligned objects and/or moving objects in the shots.  Even bracketed portrait shots of a person using a tripod can result in tiny movements by the person that require excellent alignment and deghosting by HDR software, and Photomatix currently beats PaintShop Pro's ""Exposure Merge"" tool in this area.  PaintShop Pro's ""Exposure Merge"" tool frequently has ghosting artifacts leftover either from movement of the camera by the photographer or movement of objects in the scene.  This ghosting is especially evident in scenes such as landscapes where various plants may be moving in the breeze or portraits where the subject has slightly moved in between each bracketed shot.  Photomatix also includes a plethora of other tone mapping, image stacking, and on-the-fly editing adjustments, including being able to define specific areas of photos to deghost and specific areas of photos where I can use the original image instead of the HDR output.  I use these Photomatix functions a lot because I always aim for very natural-looking HDR images, instead of the surreal psychedelic HDR images that are, all too often, output by people.  HDR software can be abused to create unnatural over-saturated photos that become tiresome to look at.  Using Photomatix on an image of people set against a beautiful background landscape, I can tell the software to use an original un-HDR'ed exposure of a photo for the people's faces while letting the software HDR-process the rest of the landscape, and this is very useful to me because HDR-processed skin tones can sometimes look unnatural.  PaintShop Pro's ""Exposure Merge"" tool cannot perform these functions that I described.  So a good HDR workflow would be to HDR-process your bracketed photos first using Photomatix, and then further edit the HDR output in PaintShop Pro, perhaps performing some sharpening as the last step before saving the files.

 The new ""Photo Blend"" tool lets you merge the best aspects of multiple photos into one photo by removing, swapping, or adding details to the final combined photo.  This is often used for group shots when you have some people with eyes open and some with eyes closed, or to remove distracting objects from a static scene such as cars and other strangers in the background, but this can also be used for fun creative purposes as well.  As with the new ""Exposure Merge"" HDR tool, this is ideally used with identically composed photos that were all shot from a tripod or a very steady hand.  When I mentioned above that Photomatix lets me specifically define and select the original un-HDR'ed exposure of a photo for people's faces, I can simulate this function in PaintShop Pro by using this new ""Photo Blend"" tool on the saved file output after using the ""Exposure Merge"" tool, but this workflow is very cumbersome and tedious.

 The new ""Selective Focus"" tool is pretty fun to work with, letting you simulate the effect of tilt-shift lenses (e.g. Lensbaby) by selectively blurring areas.  This is also somewhat similar to simulating a shallow depth of field when using a large aperture setting on a camera lens to get a blurry bokeh background surrounding your main subject of focus.

 Although adding a vignette effect was present in previous PaintShop Pro versions, this has now been expanded into a separate tool with more flexible options.

 A new ""Fill Light"" filter lets your brighten shadow areas in photos and a separate ""Clarity"" filter lets you sharpen or soften subtle details in a photo.  These two filters, presented together as a single tool, can be used, for example, on a portrait to brighten a dark shadowed region of the face while selectively softening the wrinkles on the person's face for portraits shot in the harsh bright glare of mid-day sun.

 Although Corel hopes that users perform RAW conversion using their new AfterShot Pro software (which was formerly ""Bibble Pro"" before Corel acquired Bibble Labs), PaintShop Pro still includes its ""Camera RAW Lab"" for RAW conversion, and this X4 version adds new highlight recovery options to recover details in overexposed regions of a photo.

 More than 20 tools have been upgraded to support 16-bit images.

 There is built-in one-click photo sharing that lets you upload photos to either Facebook or Flickr, or send via email.

 Ergonomics, Usability & Ease of Use:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating

 The user interface now features three separate, yet integrated, workflow interfaces, designated by tabs across the top of the program window: ""Manage"", ""Adjust"", ""Edit"".  The ""Photo Organizer"" in previous versions is now replaced by an ""Organizer"" palette which is available from all three workflow tabs.

 The ""Manage"" tab is where you browse, review, and rate images, edit metadata, and create collections of photos.  This workspace lets you review and organize your photo files.  Using the navigation palette, you can select an entire photo folder on your computer, narrow the selection according to one or more tags that you have assigned to photos, or narrow the selection according to the ratings that you have assigned to photos.  The palette also shows basic EXIF information about a photo.

 The ""Adjust"" tab is where you can make photo adjustments using a subset of the most common tools such as sharpening, color balance, brightness/contrast, fill light, clarity, tone mapping, noise removal, cropping, straightening, red-eye removal, or using its various built-in touch-up tools.  Edits can also be applied to batches of files.  This tab only offers a portion of the tools that are all available from the ""Edit"" tab.  Its interface is cleaner and far less busy than the ""Edit"" tab, and because of its simpler layout, it makes an ideal interface for beginning users who are just starting to learn the software.

 The ""Edit"" tab includes all of the entire sets of tools for photo editing, drawing, painting, and graphic design work.  By contrast, the ""Adjust"" tab offers only a subset of what can be accessed from the ""Edit"" tab.  I think of the ""Adjust"" tab as being designed for novice newbies and beginning-intermediate levels of users, who often are not exactly sure what is wrong with their photo and how specifically to correct/adjust it, and the ""Edit"" tab is designed for advanced power users like me who want to have direct access to all the tools.  If you are just starting out with graphics software, I recommend that you begin your photo editing from the ""Adjust"" tab, and then later as you become more proficient with the software, you can ignore this tab and always proceed directly to the ""Edit"" tab.  The ""Adjust"" tab is much cleaner with its presentation of tools grouped into a handful of categories on the left side of the user interface and four menu options along the top, whereas the ""Edit"" tab lets you access every possible tool in its comprehensive tool chest and eleven menu options along the top.  Overall, I think that this three-tab design strikes a happy balance that addresses the needs of both new users and power users.

 While the ""Manage"" and ""Adjust"" tabs are more simpler, clean, and organized in their user interface layouts, the ""Edit"" tab feels very busy and crowded, and it can be hard to find tools, especially when you are initially familiarizing yourself with all of the software's dozens of tools.  And to add to this ergonomics and usability issue, the main menu on the ""Edit"" tab divides the tools into two menu options: 'Adjust' and 'Effects'.  The ""Adjust"" tab includes a subset of options that are listed under the 'Adjust' menu option on the ""Edit"" tab.  One ambiguous example is that under the 'Adjust' main menu option of the ""Edit"" tab, there is a 'Brightness and Contrast' option that then opens up a submenu containing the new 'Fill Light/Clarity' tool.  But the 'Adjust' menu also lists a similar tool called 'Fill Flash'.  Both the 'Fill Light/Clarity' and 'Fill Flash' tools have a similar function, but neither the printed User Manual nor the online ""Help Topics"" documentation explain what the differences between both tools are.  At a minimum, the 'Fill Flash' tool also needs to be moved into the submenu below the 'Brightness and Contrast' option.  Ideally, both 'Fill Flash', which has 'Strength' and 'Saturation' slider settings, and 'Fill Light/Clarity', which has 'Fill Light' and 'Clarity' slider settings, should be combined into a single tool window containing three or four sliders, instead of confusing users as to which of these two tools to use.

 The software links to a variety of searchable online help and built-in tutorials.  As with some of their other recent software releases, Corel has the help documentation in this PaintShop Pro X4 set up so that clicking on the 'Help' option from the menu and then selecting 'Help Topics' starts up your browser and takes you to Corel's Web site where all of the help topics are accessible online and can also be searched.  I really wished that Corel gave the user the option, during the initial software CD installation process, to either install the entire help documentation locally on the computer or to link the software to Corel's online Web site.  After all, being dependent upon online access in order to access help information can be problematic if the user needs to search the 'Help Topics' from a place where there is no Internet access.  On September 2011, Corel released a 125-MB 'Corel_PSPX4_LocalHelp.exe' patch that does install all of the help files locally on my computer, but after I installed this patch, clicking the 'Help Topics' still always brings up my browser and opens up a new tab to display Corel's online help content.  And there does not seem to be a way to configure PaintShop Pro X4 to default to offline mode and use the locally-installed help files even when no Internet connection is available.  But you can still manually access the locally-installed help files by directly pointing your browser at the directory path where all of the help files are installed.  The main Web page for the help files is located in the directory path below:

32-bit C:\Program Files\Corel\Corel PaintShop Pro X4\Languages\EN\Help\wwhelp\wwhimpl\js\html\wwhelp.htm
64-bit: C:\Program Files (x86)\Corel\Corel PaintShop Pro X4\Languages\EN\Help\wwhelp\wwhimpl\js\html\wwhelp.htm

If, like me, your PaintShop pro install also constantly redirects you to Corel's Web site, you can point your Web browser to this location to access the locally-installed help files.  This locally-installed help documentation page, complete with a search function, works well using either Internet Explorer or Safari browsers, but Firefox just displays a blank two-framed page.

 Performance, Stability, Reliability:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating

 Compared to previous versions of PaintShop Pro, this X4 version has pretty good stability.  During almost one year of weekly usage before writing this review, I have had the software crash or hang about 6 times total, and this includes running the software on an old underpowered Windows Vista laptop and a tiny Windows 7 Dell Mini 10 netbook.  Corel has obviously worked on adding stability with this version, along with GPU optimizations.

 Speed has been noticeably improved, the performance is considerably faster than previous versions, start-up time to launch the program for the first time has been improved, and these improvements are especially apparent when running PaintShop Pro X4 on an older slower computer.  When used on my 5-year old Windows Vista laptop with 2GB memory, applying most effects happens in real-time, and for some operations such as adjusting sharpening parameters on 100-MB TIFF image files, the pop-up preview window will still display a progress meter, but these progress meters only last for a few seconds on this older laptop of mine.

 This new X4 version of PaintShop Pro now requires only 1GB of disk space.  The previous PaintShop Pro X3 version required 3GB of disk space, which tells me that prior to X4, PaintShop Pro had become very bloated and disorganized.  So this redesign both increased performance and reduced the disk space required.  By comparison, Adobe's latest Photoshop Elements 10 requires a whopping 3GB to 4GB of disk space, even though it has less features and effects than PaintShop Pro X4.

 Competitive Pricing & Value:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating

 At the time of this review's writing, PaintShop Pro X4 Ultimate is being discounted on Amazon at a price less than $50, and its price is less than Amazon's price for Photoshop Elements 10, even though PSPX4 is a more capable and better program!

 Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:

For overall bang-for-the-buck combination of very affordable value and feature-packed power in a commercial photo-editing software package, this PaintShop Pro X4 currently reigns supreme, beating out Adobe Photoshop Elements 10 and all other photo-editing software that I can think of.  If you want something even less expensive, look into a freeware graphics software called ""GIMP"" which offers a ton of graphics editing power for free.  And if you have no experience with graphics software or if you do not want to spend time learning its complexities, look into the free and easy-to-use software called ""Paint. NET"".

Despite the significant performance improvements in version X4 (I think that it is roughly 50% to 100% faster than X3 and also more stable), it still does have its slow areas of laggardly performance.  In particular, this is not a good software for processing RAW files, both due to its slow RAW converter and due to its limited RAW compatibility.  But now that Corel has repackaged Bibble Lab's ""Bibble Pro"" as their ""AfterShot Pro"" software, you should consider ""AfterShot Pro"" for your RAW file processing; Bibble had one of the fastest RAW converters and Corel acquired Bibble Labs to compete with Adobe's Lightroom.

If you want the deluxe photo management and editing solution, deluxe in capability, cost, and complexity, using Adobe's Lightroom and Photoshop CS are the way to go.  Otherwise, this PaintShop Pro X4 is an excellent ""Photoshop for the masses"" alternative.  If you primarily shoot in RAW, adding Corel's new AfterShot Pro allows for great RAW handling followed by photo editing in PaintShop Pro X4.  And if Corel's HDR feature in PaintShop Pro X4 has whetted your appetite for HDR processing, you should seriously consider getting Photomatix Pro (currently at version 4) since its capabilities exceed anything that Corel or Adobe has to offer.

If you are using a previous version of PaintShop Pro, is this PaintShop Pro X4 worth the upgrade?

Most definitely!  As previously mentioned, if version X4's one main new feature was the addition of HDR tools, I would say to just keep your existing X3 version and purchase Photomatix for your HDR needs since Photomatix is far better at HDR processing than what Corel, or Adobe, has as their HDR offering.  But there are at least 75 new and enhanced features with version X4, and if you can purchase it aggressively discounted on Amazon, this is a must-buy upgrade.  Even if you ignore all of its new features and enhancements, just the fact that X4 runs a lot faster and more stable than X3 is a compelling enough reason to upgrade.

If you are just starting out with photo-editing, should you buy this PaintShop Pro X4 or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Photoshop-Elements-10/dp/B005MMMT6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Photoshop Elements 10</a>?

I feel that PaintShop Pro X4 is a far more capable and feature-rich program than Adobe Photoshop Elements 10.  PSPX4 is more like the full-blown Photoshop CS version than APE10.  APE10 includes more built-in layer styles that PSPX4 does not have, although if you are just starting out, you will not miss this.  Once you become proficient in PSPX4, you can create your own styles and record them as scripts to repeatedly reuse.  Photoshop Elements has a much larger user base than PaintShop Pro, and there are numerous sites to download brushes and textures from, but it is easy to convert Photoshop brushes to use in PSP, so that is not really a problem.  APE10 has more adjustment brushes than PSPX4 when it comes to brushing on effects like dodge, burn, and saturation.  But PSPX4 has more artistic tools than APE10, useful for painting, drawing, scrapbooking, and graphic design, and PSPX4 is more useful and flexible for manipulating images other than photos than APE10.  PSPX4 requires less than half the disk space to install than APE10, and at the time of this review's writing, Amazon has it priced lower than APE10, even though PSPX4 is far more packed with features.  But... if you think that you will eventually migrate up to Photoshop CS, which is far more complex, powerful, and expensive, then starting out with APE10 will give you skills that are more transferable to Photoshop CS than becoming proficient with PSPX4.

One final note:

Two of the extras that are included in this ""Ultimate"" bundle are couple codes that allow you to download 21 photos from Fotolia and receive a $33.95 discount off a photo book that you create from the Blurb.com Web site.  However, these coupon codes have expiration dates on them, and on the package that I received, the offers are only valid through December 31 2012.  I do not know if this expiration date applies to the coupon codes of all ""Ultimate"" packages that are shipped throughout 2012 or if Corel adjusts the expiration dates for packages that are shipped out later, but that is something to consider if you are deciding to purchase this near the end of 2012.

Also, during the past 8 months, Corel has released two important service pack patch updates for this PaintShop Pro X4.  After installing PaintShop Pro on your computer, you can either download these large 235-MB executables from Corel's Web site, or from the user interface, click 'Help' and ""Check for Updates"" to download and install the service packs that way.",5
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:
 Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!

I originally started using Corel's VideoStudio software beginning with version X2.  With this X4 version, Corel continues to add new features and useful enhancements, important bug fixes and crucial improvements to software stability, along with performance and speed boosts by taking advantage of Intel's and AMD's new CPUs and also GPU acceleration provided by specific Nvidia graphics processors.  One really cool performance feature offered by VideoStudio is that it has a ""Smart Proxy"" editing mode, where you can edit high-definition video in a low-resolution mode, thereby allowing you to use a slower computer without necessarily slowing down to a sluggish crawl.  These performance enhancements offer a huge advantage because many of us do not upgrade our computers frequently with the latest fastest CPU processors.  So some of the other brands of video editing software may be unbearably slow on these slower computers (even to the point of completely freezing up) while VideoStudio X4 can still zip along with a decent amount of responsiveness on slower computers.

Even though I do not like how Corel has organized the user interface layout for their PaintShop Pro X4 photo-editing software, I continue to like the changes and improvements that they have made to this VideoStudio X4.  I can resize, drag, dock, and undock various windows and UI elements to suit my workspace preferences and everything seems to behave intuitively.  But as with how Corel has designed their help system for PaintShop Pro X4 software, the one aspect of the VideoStudio X4 user interface that I really dislike is that to access the help menus, I am forced to hop through intermediate menus before it launches the online help from Corel's Web site using my browser.  With both PaintShop Pro X4 and VideoStudio X4, I now just bookmark the help information URLs and access them directly from my browser instead of clicking the cumbersome help button from within the application.  Even though the latest and most up-to-date online help information can be dynamically accessed directly from Corel's Web site when using this browser approach, I would still really prefer the previous approach of at least being given the option during the installation of the software to load the full help documentation on my computer's local hard drive since that also gives me the freedom to access the user manuals and help guides when I use the software without having Internet access.

I had fun using the new time-lapse photography feature.  I used a Canon Timer Remote Controller TC-80N3 to shoot a series of timer-delayed photos of the sun setting behind the mountains and another cool every-two-minutes photo series that I made last summer of a morning glory vine slowly opening up its blooms, and then I used the VideoStudio X4's time-lapse photography feature to create a video from both of these photo series that look like a sped-up time-lapse movie.  If both videos had been recorded as real-time videos, they would have been mind-numbingly boring to watch, but when sped up using the time-lapse feature, they allow everyday people like me to showcase the wonders of nature just like how the professional movies and television nature programs use time-lapse photography.

The software lets me use both standard definition and HD videos, and editing, authoring, and burning of both video types is easy.  The software is very flexible in importing videos from your hard drive or capturing them directly from your video recorders.  There are flexible options for viewing your files in different ways such as timeline or storyboard modes, which are useful for adding videos, pictures, text, audio and music tracks.  You can also trim or split your video into sections for better continuity, adding transitions and enhancing with many kinds of built-in effects.  Once you upload your video, you can trim and divide the video into clips.  Trimming is marking the beginning and ending of an entire clip, while multi-trimming is useful to divide one segment into multiple clips.  Multi-trimming is very useful for editing out various parts of a recorded video to exclude sections that are boring or extraneous.  This software's trimming functions are powerful and very easy to use, allowing me to feel like a Hollywood film director while I edit my videos to make them flow seamlessly between different scenes.

As with previous versions of VideoStudio, you can import photos to create a photo slideshow along with adding text and music accompaniment.  The software is very flexible for adding music or audio voiceovers to your video projects from a variety of sources.  You can add audio to your projects in Corel VideoStudio X4 using various methods such as adding audio files to the library from your hard drive, ripping music from a CD, or recording a voiceover clip.  You can edit the audio clips using a built-in sound mixer to adjust the volume, length and duration, fade-in/fade-out, and apply various mixing and sound filter effects to the audio tracks.  The video editor does limit you to six overlay video tracks along with your main video track, combined with up to two title tracks, a voice track, and three music tracks.  While this is less than some video-editing software that lets you incorporate many dozens of tracks, it is more than sufficient for the vast majority of everyday users (like me) who mainly work with personal videos and it is sufficient even for editing important events like videos of weddings and vacations.

After you have finished editing your video masterpiece, you can export in a variety of common formats including FLV files for YouTube, MPG (MPEG-1/MPEG-2), AVCHD, WMV HD, Windows Media, RealMedia, AVI, and QuickTime.  You also have the option to upload your work to Vimeo, Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube.  The software can create menus for DVD, Blu-ray, AVCHD, and it offers eight Blu-ray and twelve DVD menu choices.  This X4 version also adds new 3D video capabilities.  Even though I admit that I am a 3D video editing newbie, this feature seems limited and fairly rudimentary in its 3D rendering options, but it can create some pretty cool eye-popping 3D effects and is easy to use.  This will NOT get you the kind of 3D video that Hollywood can create, but it does add another dimension of ""eye candy Wow factor"" to your videos...  Just don't expect to create your own version of an ""Avatar 3D"" movie.  3D glasses are included with the software.

The ""Ultimate"" extras that are included in this software consist of proDAD Mercalli SE video correction/stabilization software and Boris Graffiti 5.3 for text/title/graphics animation and 3D effects.  The proDAD Mercalli SE video correction/stabilization software really makes a noticeable difference to stabilize and remove the shake from my videos, which I mostly shoot hand-held.

This is a big complex software application that really requires some patience for you to slowly become more familiar with all of its features and power.  But its user interface is cleanly designed so that newbie first-timers can start editing their videos with ease without fully mastering all of its powerful features.  Fortunately, Corel also provides plenty of online help along with easy-to-use templates and more than 60 really cool special effects and more than 150 transition effects to let you experiment and try out many of its flexible options so even video-editing newbies can create a polished slick video with ease.  The software uses a nondestructive editing approach so that your original video file is not being directly modified along the way.  This also allows you to experiment, even trying out wacky ideas and special effects, turning a tedious chore into a fun playtime of creating video eye candy.

Back when I was using VideoStudio X2, the software had various erratic and quirky bugs and serious stability issues; it can be disheartening to have the software freeze up after you have spent more than an hour editing a video.  Many of these problems have thankfully been resolved in this version X4; not once did I encounter a freeze-up or crash during my edits using X4.  When used on an older slower Windows Vista laptop of mine, the software can be sluggishly slow sometimes, but I prefer dealing with slower performance on a slower computer than having to deal with annoying software bugs and applications that freeze up or crash on me, so I accept the fact that I have to wait longer when using VideoStudio X4 on a slower laptop that is more than four years old.  As with any video editing software, especially when editing HD videos, your best experience will result from using a fast computer with lots of memory.  While this VideoStudio X4 lacks some of the features and has more track-editing limitations when compared to both CyberLink PowerDirector and Adobe Premiere, I think that it beats those two when it comes to multi-trim clip editing, key framing, and its best-in-class stop-motion and time-lapse animation capabilities.  And VideoStudio X4 is far easier and more intuitive to learn for a newbie compared to Adobe Premiere's dense complexity.  If this software was priced at $300, I would rate it 4 stars or maybe 3.5 stars, but with its inexpensive list price and Corel's frequent heavy pricing discounts, I rate it 5 stars because you really do get a lot of video editing bang for the buck here.  And if you are not technically adept, have some patience as you familiarize yourself with the software.

Also, Corel has released two important service pack patch updates for VideoStudio Pro X4.  After installing VideoStudio Pro on your computer, you can either download these large executable files from Corel's Web site, or from the user interface, click 'Help' and ""Check for Updates"" to download and install the service packs that way.",5
" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:
 Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!

 Design & Features:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating
 Ergonomics & Usability:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating
 Performance, Stability & Reliability:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating
 Competitive Pricing & Value:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating

 Positives:

 Many stability and performance issues from the previous X3 versions of both PaintShop Pro and VideoStudio Pro were resolved in this X4 version. It runs noticeably quicker, even on slower 5-year old laptops and small netbooks, with good stability.
 PaintShop Pro X4 offers a very wide range of tools for both photo editing and graphic design, ranging from serious photography-specific tools to fun graphics manipulation.
 PaintShop Pro X4 combines photo editing, photo retouching, painting, drawing, graphics design, and image management in a single package.
 PaintShop Pro X4 has a great selection of photo enhancement tools, both to fix common photography issues and also more esoteric image manipulation tools.
 PaintShop Pro X4 includes Web graphics tools for image mapping and slicing, and for coding image rollovers and Web button creation.
 Very affordable, yet very powerful, for both photo and video editing; currently selling on Amazon at a heavily discounted pricing of less than $90.
 A very useful ""Learning Center"" and video tutorials help newbies learn the software and accomplish common tasks.
 The PaintShop Pro X4 user interface is divided into three tabs, ""Manage"", ""Adjust"", ""Edit"", providing a usable workflow from initial photo review to final editing, and allowing you to configure, customize, and save how you use each workspace. You can also customize each toolbar individually.
 VideoStudio Pro's ""Smart Proxy"" editing mode lets you can edit high-definition video in a low-resolution mode, thereby allowing you to use a slower computer without necessarily slowing down to a sluggish crawl.
 VideoStudio Pro has a new time-lapse photography feature to create time-lapse movies from a set of photos shot over a period of time.
 The included proDAD Mercalli SE video correction/stabilization for use in VideoStudio Pro X4 works wonderfully to stabilize and remove the shake from hand-held videos.

 Negatives:

 Even though the new HDR ""Exposure Merge"" tool in PaintShop Pro X4 is a great start, the tool is not always precise at aligning objects between bracketed shots and it is especially lacking in deghosting; both problems can arise from either camera movement or movement of objects in the scene.
 PaintShop Pro X4 has limited RAW file processing capabilities and compatibilities compared to Adobe Lightroom, but Corel now intends for RAW handling to be better addressed in their new AfterShot Pro software.
 Despite being more uncluttered and streamlined than the previous X3 version's user interface, the ""Edit"" tab of the new PaintShop Pro X4 user interface, which serves as the main workhorse for serious image editing, is still somewhat cluttered and disorganized, with overlapping functions and ambiguous groupings of tools, and this impacts the ergonomics and usability of the software, especially for new users.
 For the graphics newbie who has no previous experience using graphics software, there is a medium-to-high learning curve effort required to learn how to proficiently use the PaintShop Pro software. This software is not specifically designed for simple image manipulation by novices. If you are initially learning this software, you should start off just using the ""Adjust"" tab and not use the ""Edit"" tab; the ""Adjust"" tab is simplified and suitable to novices whereas the ""Edit"" tab is meant for power users.
 As with some of Corel's other recent products, accessing the help documentation for both PaintShop Pro and VideoStudio Pro requires access to Corel's online Web site for information, instead of being able to access all help documentation locally on my computer directly from within the application.

This affordably-priced bundle essentially consists of two separate Corel products: PaintShop Pro X4 and VideoStudio Pro X4. In addition, the ""Ultimate"" extras that separate it from their non-Ultimate counterparts include: Nik Color Efex Pro 3.0 photographic filters, extra ""Picture Tube"" images for use in PaintShop Pro, proDAD Mercalli SE video correction/stabilization for use in VideoStudio Pro, Boris Graffiti 5.3 for text/title/graphics animation and 3D effects, and coupons for WinZip software, Blurb.com photo book, and 21 free image downloads from Fotolia's Web site. If you are really only interested in either PaintShop Pro X4 or VideoStudio Pro X4, but do not want both products, you can just purchase either product in their separate ""Ultimate"" packaging.

I have always been a fan of PaintShop Pro throughout the 1990s and I have often kept updating PSP versions after Corel acquired its original developer, JASC Software, in 2004, even though I also have been updating versions of CorelDRAW Graphics Suite starting from CorelDRAW 5. Along with recently releasing the new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-AfterShot-Pro/dp/B006WVR9GY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel AfterShot Pro</a>&nbsp;this year (after Corel acquired Bibble Labs and repackaged their ""Bibble Pro"" as ""AfterShot Pro"") and also the newly updated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CorelDRAW-Graphics-Suite-X6/dp/B007IWCQ8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X6</a>, which includes Corel's original photo-editor called ""Photo-Paint"", Corel now has three photo applications which have some overlapping functions and also unique abilities of their own. As a photo management application, AfterShot Pro is meant to complement PaintShop Pro and compete against Adobe Photoshop Lightroom. PaintShop Pro remains my favorite ""Photoshop for the non-professional-graphics masses"" application, being more feature-packed and capable like Photoshop CS than Adobe's own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Photoshop-Elements-10/dp/B005MMMT6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Photoshop Elements 10</a>.

Even though my video-editing skills rank far behind my photo-editing and graphics design skills, I started using Corel's VideoStudio Pro software when it was at version ""X2"". The VideoStudio Pro X4 version that is included in this software bundle offers powerful video editing with great stop-motion and time-lapse animation capabilities. But as with the PaintShop Pro photo software, you need plenty of patience to progressively learn all of its features.

The Corel Photo and Video Pro X4 Ultimate Bundle's notable product features are described and rated below:

 Design & Features:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating:

 After Corel acquired JASC Software, they have been adding new features with each release, and even though this version runs and feels slower than earlier versions of PSP, I feel that it is a fair trade-off to allow the code bloat due to the number and complexity of features to slow the software down. With this latest X4 version, I get a powerful set of photo and graphics editing tools that is more useful than Photoshop Elements 10. PaintShop Pro X4 pales in comparison to the power of the full-blown Photoshop CS, but with its significantly lower pricing and learning curve compared to Photoshop CS, it is obviously meant to compete against software like Photoshop Elements, which it handily outperforms.

 This ""Ultimate"" version of PaintShop Pro X4 adds even more power and value by including the award-winning Nik Color Efex Pro 3.0 photographic filters, which includes 52 photographic filters that can be applied to images to give them special effects. Also included in this Ultimate version is a collection of ""Picture Tubes"", which are thematic collections of graphics that can be painted onto an image to add more bling to your images, frames, and borders.

 To help you navigate through the plethora of PaintShop Pro tools and effects, a very useful 'Effect Browser' lets you try out the various effects, instead of accessing each effect one by one.

 PaintShop Pro includes tools that are very friendly to use by newbies such as 'One Step Photo Fix', 'Smart Photo Fix', and 'One Step Noise Removal'.

 The new PaintShop Pro HDR (High Dynamic Range) ""Exposure Merge"" tool is Corel's foray into HDR software, which Adobe and other graphics software vendors are also incorporating into their tools. HDR processing involves combining multiple exposures of the exact same shot (which is easier if your camera has an Automatic Exposure Bracketing (AEB) function) to create a high dynamic range photo which can display a higher tonal range than what the camera is capable of capturing in a single exposure. There are various software specifically dedicated to HDR processing. For the past four years, since version 3 in 2008, I have been using the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Photomatix-Pro-4/dp/B002CIP12U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Photomatix Pro 4</a>&nbsp;software for HDR processing. On a relative scale specifically rating its HDR functions, I would rate Photomatix 5 fuzzy stars while this PaintShop Pro X4's new HDR ""Exposure Merge"" tool only gets 3 fuzzy stars rating. Both Corel and Adobe still have a long way to catch up with the powerful and flexible offerings in Photomatix. In particular, I found the ""Exposure Merge"" tool in this version of PaintShop Pro X4 to be lacking in its ability to precisely align bracketed photos and thoroughly and flexibly remove ghosting artifacts, which is something that Photomatix does a very good job at. If you use a tripod-mounted camera to shoot bracketed photos where nothing in the scene moves the least bit, then the ""Exposure Merge"" tool consistently outputs good HDR results. But when shooting portraits or landscapes, or shooting hand-held, bracketed photos often have misaligned objects and/or moving objects in the shots. Even bracketed portrait shots of a person using a tripod can result in tiny movements by the person that require excellent alignment and deghosting by HDR software, and Photomatix currently beats PaintShop Pro's ""Exposure Merge"" tool in this area. PaintShop Pro's ""Exposure Merge"" tool frequently has ghosting artifacts leftover either from movement of the camera by the photographer or movement of objects in the scene. This ghosting is especially evident in scenes such as landscapes where various plants may be moving in the breeze or portraits where the subject has slightly moved in between each bracketed shot.

Photomatix also includes a plethora of other tone mapping, image stacking, and on-the-fly editing adjustments, including being able to define specific areas of photos to deghost and specific areas of photos where I can use the original image instead of the HDR output. I use these Photomatix functions a lot because I always aim for very natural-looking HDR images, instead of the surreal psychedelic HDR images that are, all too often, output by people. HDR software can be abused to create unnatural over-saturated photos that become tiresome to look at. Using Photomatix on an image of people set against a beautiful background landscape, I can tell the software to use an original un-HDR'ed exposure of a photo for the people's faces while letting the software HDR-process the rest of the landscape, and this is very useful to me because HDR-processed skin tones can sometimes look unnatural. PaintShop Pro's ""Exposure Merge"" tool cannot perform these functions that I described. So a good HDR workflow would be to HDR-process your bracketed photos first using Photomatix, and then further edit the HDR output in PaintShop Pro, perhaps performing some sharpening as the last step before saving the files.

 The new PaintShop Pro ""Photo Blend"" tool lets you merge the best aspects of multiple photos into one photo by removing, swapping, or adding details to the final combined photo. This is often used for group shots when you have some people with eyes open and some with eyes closed, or to remove distracting objects from a static scene such as cars and other strangers in the background, but this can also be used for fun creative purposes as well. As with the new ""Exposure Merge"" HDR tool, this is ideally used with identically composed photos that were all shot from a tripod or a very steady hand.

 The new PaintShop Pro ""Selective Focus"" tool is pretty fun to work with, letting you simulate the effect of tilt-shift lenses (e.g. Lensbaby) by selectively blurring areas. This is also somewhat similar to simulating a shallow depth of field when using a large aperture setting on a camera lens to get a blurry bokeh background surrounding your main subject of focus.

 A new PaintShop Pro ""Fill Light"" filter lets your brighten shadow areas in photos and a separate ""Clarity"" filter lets you sharpen or soften subtle details in a photo. These two filters, presented together as a single tool, can be used, for example, on a portrait to brighten a dark shadowed region of the face while selectively softening the wrinkles on the person's face for portraits shot in the harsh bright glare of mid-day sun.

 Although Corel hopes that users perform RAW conversion using their new AfterShot Pro software (which was formerly ""Bibble Pro"" before Corel acquired Bibble Labs), PaintShop Pro still includes its ""Camera RAW Lab"" for RAW conversion, and this X4 version adds new highlight recovery options to recover details in overexposed regions of a photo.

 PaintShop Pro has built-in one-click photo sharing that lets you upload photos to either Facebook or Flickr, or send via email. Likewise, VideoStudio Pro lets you upload movies to YouTube.

 I had fun using VideoStudio Pro's new time-lapse photography feature. I used a Canon Timer Remote Controller TC-80N3 to shoot a series of timer-delayed photos of the sun setting behind the mountains and another cool every-two-minutes photo series that I made last summer of a morning glory vine slowly opening up its blooms, and then I used the VideoStudio Pro X4's time-lapse photography feature to create a video from both of these photo series that look like a sped-up time-lapse movie. If both videos had been recorded as real-time videos, they would have been mind-numbingly boring to watch, but when sped up using the time-lapse feature, they allow everyday people like me to showcase the wonders of nature just like how the professional movies and television nature programs use time-lapse photography.

 VideoStudio Pro lets me use both standard definition and HD videos, and editing, authoring, and burning of both video types is easy. The software is very flexible in importing videos from your hard drive or capturing them directly from your video recorders. There are flexible options for viewing your files in different ways such as timeline or storyboard modes, which are useful for adding videos, pictures, text, audio and music tracks. You can also trim or split your video into sections for better continuity, adding transitions and enhancing with many kinds of built-in effects. Once you upload your video, you can trim and divide the video into clips. Trimming is marking the beginning and ending of an entire clip, while multi-trimming is useful to divide one segment into multiple clips. Multi-trimming is very useful for editing out various parts of a recorded video to exclude sections that are boring or extraneous. This software's trimming functions are powerful and very easy to use, allowing me to feel like a Hollywood film director while I edit my videos to make them flow seamlessly between different scenes.

 As with previous versions of VideoStudio, you can import photos to create a photo slideshow along with adding text and music accompaniment. The software is very flexible for adding music or audio voiceovers to your video projects from a variety of sources. You can add audio to your projects in Corel VideoStudio Pro X4 using various methods such as adding audio files to the library from your hard drive, ripping music from a CD, or recording a voiceover clip. You can edit the audio clips using a built-in sound mixer to adjust the volume, length and duration, fade-in/fade-out, and apply various mixing and sound filter effects to the audio tracks. The video editor does limit you to six overlay video tracks along with your main video track, combined with up to two title tracks, a voice track, and three music tracks. While this is less than some video-editing software that lets you incorporate many dozens of tracks, it is more than sufficient for the vast majority of everyday users (like me) who mainly work with personal videos and it is sufficient even for editing important events like videos of weddings and vacations.

 After you have finished editing your video masterpiece in VideoStudio Pro, you can export in a variety of common formats including FLV files for YouTube, MPG (MPEG-1/MPEG-2), AVCHD, WMV HD, Windows Media, RealMedia, AVI, and QuickTime. You also have the option to upload your work to Vimeo, Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube. The software can create menus for DVD, Blu-ray, AVCHD, and it offers eight Blu-ray and twelve DVD menu choices. This X4 version also adds new 3D video capabilities. Even though I admit that I am a 3D video editing newbie, this feature seems limited and fairly rudimentary in its 3D rendering options, but it can create some pretty cool eye-popping 3D effects and is easy to use. This will NOT get you the kind of 3D video that Hollywood can create, but it does add another dimension of ""eye candy Wow factor"" to your videos. Just don't expect to create your own version of an ""Avatar 3D"" movie. 3D glasses are included with the software.

 The ""Ultimate"" version of VideoStudio Pro X4 includes proDAD Mercalli SE video correction/stabilization software that really makes a noticeable difference to stabilize and remove the shake from my videos, which I mostly shoot hand-held.

 Ergonomics, Usability & Ease of Use:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating

 The PaintShop Pro user interface now features three separate, yet integrated, workflow interfaces, designated by tabs across the top of the program window: ""Manage"", ""Adjust"", ""Edit"". The ""Photo Organizer"" in previous versions is now replaced by an ""Organizer"" palette which is available from all three workflow tabs.

 The PaintShop Pro ""Manage"" tab is where you browse, review, and rate images, edit metadata, and create collections of photos. This workspace lets you review and organize your photo files. Using the navigation palette, you can select an entire photo folder on your computer, narrow the selection according to one or more tags that you have assigned to photos, or narrow the selection according to the ratings that you have assigned to photos. The palette also shows basic EXIF information about a photo.

 The PaintShop Pro ""Adjust"" tab is where you can make photo adjustments using a subset of the most common tools such as sharpening, color balance, brightness/contrast, fill light, clarity, tone mapping, noise removal, cropping, straightening, red-eye removal, or using its various built-in touch-up tools. Edits can also be applied to batches of files. This tab only offers a portion of the tools that are all available from the ""Edit"" tab. Its interface is cleaner and far less busy than the ""Edit"" tab, and because of its simpler layout, it makes an ideal interface for beginning users who are just starting to learn the software.

 The PaintShop Pro ""Edit"" tab includes all of the entire sets of tools for photo editing, drawing, painting, and graphic design work. By contrast, the ""Adjust"" tab offers only a subset of what can be accessed from the ""Edit"" tab. I think of the ""Adjust"" tab as being designed for novice newbies and beginning-intermediate levels of users, who often are not exactly sure what is wrong with their photo and how specifically to correct/adjust it, and the ""Edit"" tab is designed for advanced power users like me who want to have direct access to all the tools. If you are just starting out with graphics software, I recommend that you begin your photo editing from the ""Adjust"" tab, and then later as you become more proficient with the software, you can ignore this tab and always proceed directly to the ""Edit"" tab. The ""Adjust"" tab is much cleaner with its presentation of tools grouped into a handful of categories on the left side of the user interface and four menu options along the top, whereas the ""Edit"" tab lets you access every possible tool in its comprehensive tool chest and eleven menu options along the top. Overall, I think that this three-tab design strikes a happy balance that addresses the needs of both new users and power users.

 While the PaintShop Pro ""Manage"" and ""Adjust"" tabs are more simpler, clean, and organized in their user interface layouts, the ""Edit"" tab feels very busy and crowded, and it can be hard to find tools, especially when you are initially familiarizing yourself with all of the software's dozens of tools. And to add to this ergonomics and usability issue, the main menu on the ""Edit"" tab divides the tools into two menu options: 'Adjust' and 'Effects'. The ""Adjust"" tab includes a subset of options that are listed under the 'Adjust' menu option on the ""Edit"" tab. One ambiguous example is that under the 'Adjust' main menu option of the ""Edit"" tab, there is a 'Brightness and Contrast' option that then opens up a submenu containing the new 'Fill Light/Clarity' tool. But the 'Adjust' menu also lists a similar tool called 'Fill Flash'. Both the 'Fill Light/Clarity' and 'Fill Flash' tools have a similar function, but neither the printed User Manual nor the online ""Help Topics"" documentation explain what the differences between both tools are. At a minimum, the 'Fill Flash' tool also needs to be moved into the submenu below the 'Brightness and Contrast' option. Ideally, both 'Fill Flash', which has 'Strength' and 'Saturation' slider settings, and 'Fill Light/Clarity', which has 'Fill Light' and 'Clarity' slider settings, should be combined into a single tool window containing three or four sliders, instead of confusing users as to which of these two tools to use.

 I like the changes and improvements that Corel has made to VideoStudio Pro X4. I can resize, drag, dock, and undock various windows and UI elements to suit my workspace preferences and everything seems to behave intuitively. But as with how Corel has designed their help system for PaintShop Pro X4 software, the one aspect of the VideoStudio Pro X4 user interface that I really dislike is that to access the help menus, I am forced to hop through intermediate menus before it launches the online help from Corel's Web site using my browser. With both PaintShop Pro X4 and VideoStudio Pro X4, I now just bookmark the help information URLs and access them directly from my browser instead of clicking the cumbersome help button from within the application. Even though the latest and most up-to-date online help information can be dynamically accessed directly from Corel's Web site when using this browser approach, I would still really prefer the previous approach of at least being given the option during the installation of the software to load the full help documentation on my computer's local hard drive since that also gives me the freedom to access the user manuals and help guides when I use the software without having Internet access.

 VideoStudio Pro is a big complex software application that really requires some patience for you to slowly become more familiar with all of its features and power. But its user interface is cleanly designed so that newbie first-timers can start editing their videos with ease without fully mastering all of its powerful features. Fortunately, Corel also provides plenty of online help along with easy-to-use templates and more than 60 really cool special effects and more than 150 transition effects to let you experiment and try out many of its flexible options so even video-editing newbies can create a polished slick video with ease. The software uses a nondestructive editing approach so that your original video file is not being directly modified along the way. This also allows you to experiment, even trying out wacky ideas and special effects, turning a tedious chore into a fun playtime of creating video eye candy.

 Performance, Stability & Reliability:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating

 Compared to previous versions of PaintShop Pro, this X4 version has pretty good stability. During almost one year of weekly usage before writing this review, I have had the software crash or hang about 6 times total, and this includes running the software on an old underpowered Windows Vista laptop and a tiny Windows 7 Dell Mini 10 netbook. Corel has obviously worked on adding stability with this version, along with GPU optimizations.

 Speed has been noticeably improved, the performance is considerably faster than previous versions, start-up time to launch the program for the first time has been improved, and these improvements are especially apparent when running PaintShop Pro X4 on an older slower computer. When used on my 5-year old Windows Vista laptop with 2GB memory, applying most effects happens in real-time, and for some operations such as adjusting sharpening parameters on 100-MB TIFF image files, the pop-up preview window will still display a progress meter, but these progress meters only last for a few seconds on this older laptop of mine.

 PaintShop Pro X4 now requires only 1GB of disk space. The previous PaintShop Pro X3 version required 3GB of disk space, which tells me that prior to X4, PaintShop Pro had become very bloated and disorganized. So this redesign both increased performance and reduced the disk space required. By comparison, Adobe's latest Photoshop Elements 10 requires a whopping 3GB to 4GB of disk space, even though it has less features and effects than PaintShop Pro X4.

 With this VideoStudio Pro X4 version, Corel continues to add new features and useful enhancements, important bug fixes and crucial improvements to software stability, along with performance and speed boosts by taking advantage of Intel's and AMD's new CPUs and also GPU acceleration provided by specific Nvidia graphics processors.

 One really cool performance feature offered by VideoStudio Pro is that it has a ""Smart Proxy"" editing mode, where you can edit high-definition video in a low-resolution mode, thereby allowing you to use a slower computer without necessarily slowing down to a sluggish crawl. These performance enhancements offer a huge advantage because many of us do not upgrade our computers frequently with the latest fastest CPU processors. So some of the other brands of video editing software may be unbearably slow on these slower computers (even to the point of completely freezing up) while VideoStudio Pro X4 can still zip along with a decent amount of responsiveness on slower computers.

 Back when I was using VideoStudio Pro X2, the software had various erratic and quirky bugs and serious stability issues; it can be disheartening to have the software freeze up after you have spent more than an hour editing a video. Many of these problems have thankfully been resolved in this VideoStudio Pro X4; not once did I encounter a freeze-up or crash during my edits using X4. When used on an older slower Windows Vista laptop of mine, the software can be sluggishly slow sometimes, but I prefer dealing with slower performance on a slower computer than having to deal with annoying software bugs and applications that freeze up or crash on me, so I accept the fact that I have to wait longer when using VideoStudio Pro X4 on a slower laptop that is more than four years old. As with any video editing software, especially when editing HD videos, your best experience will result from using a fast computer with lots of memory.

 Competitive Pricing & Value:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating

 At the time of this review's writing, PaintShop Pro X4 Ultimate is being discounted on Amazon at a price less than $90.  For less than $100, there is currently no other commercial software that even comes close to the photo and video editing power and features that are offered in this fully-loaded bundle.

 Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:

For overall bang-for-the-buck combination of very affordable value and feature-packed power in a commercial photo-editing software package, PaintShop Pro X4 currently reigns supreme, beating out Adobe Photoshop Elements 10 and all other photo-editing software that I can think of. If you want something even less expensive, look into a freeware graphics software called ""GIMP"" which offers a ton of graphics editing power for free. And if you have no experience with graphics software or if you do not want to spend time learning its complexities, look into the free and easy-to-use software called ""Paint. NET"".

Despite the significant performance improvements in version X4 (I think that it is roughly 50% to 100% faster than X3 and also more stable), it still does have its slow areas of laggardly performance. In particular, this is not a good software for processing RAW files, both due to its slow RAW converter and due to its limited RAW compatibility. But now that Corel has repackaged Bibble Lab's ""Bibble Pro"" as their ""AfterShot Pro"" software, you should consider ""AfterShot Pro"" for your RAW file processing; Bibble had one of the fastest RAW converters and Corel acquired Bibble Labs to compete with Adobe's Lightroom.

If you want the deluxe photo management and editing solution, deluxe in capability, cost, and complexity, using Adobe's Lightroom and Photoshop CS are the way to go. Otherwise, this PaintShop Pro X4 is an excellent ""Photoshop for the masses"" alternative. If you primarily shoot in RAW, adding Corel's new AfterShot Pro allows for great RAW handling followed by photo editing in PaintShop Pro X4. And if Corel's HDR feature in PaintShop Pro X4 has whetted your appetite for HDR processing, you should seriously consider getting Photomatix Pro (currently at version 4) since its capabilities exceed anything that Corel or Adobe has to offer.

While the VideoStudio Pro X4 included in this bundle lacks some of the features and has more track-editing limitations when compared to both CyberLink PowerDirector and Adobe Premiere, I think that it beats those two when it comes to multi-trim clip editing, key framing, and its best-in-class stop-motion and time-lapse animation capabilities. And VideoStudio Pro X4 is far easier and more intuitive to learn for a newbie compared to Adobe Premiere's dense complexity. If this video-editing software was priced at $300, I would rate it 4 stars or maybe 3.5 stars, but with its inexpensive list price and Corel's frequent heavy pricing discounts, I rate it 5 star",5
"Many reviews comment on the color scheme. At first I was skeptical about what they meant, but after using the program; yes it is a problem. I am going to cover that as well as several other points important to know.

Back up your company files right before loading the new version 2013. It only takes a second, and makes your test drive easily reversible.

You have a choice of jumping off of the diving board by loading the new version of QB 2013 by overwriting the old version, and then converting your existing company files but unconverting them, and restoring them is a major hassle. So the following is important to know.

You can run both versions of QuickBooks (in my case 2010 and 2013) concurrently/at the same time. So you are keeping your old version of QuickBooks intact while you try out the new one. (They currently have a 60 day return policy so take it for a test drive) This is important. When installing it asks you, ""Do you want to overwrite your old version?"" If you want to test it out and not go through the rigamarole of reconverting, or restoring your old version in case you want to send the new version back, say NO by choosing the option above it in order to write it to a new location. They already have a folder designated to do that when you choose that option and it is called ""QuickBooks 2013"". Don't worry about choosing your industry edition; you can always change it later from within QuickBooks. Note: If you install it on more than one computer you must install the same industry edition. This way you can try QuickBooks without over writing your existing version, OR converting your current company files over to the 2013 version either. So play with the sample file, or do as I did if you are creating a new company in addition to the old one. So with both version running and open, if I have an order from a customer from one company I can process it without having to open and close companies to access it. In plain words I have one click access to both companies. So both Qbooks versions are open, and both companies are open at the same time. That is something you cannot do if you only have one version of QuickBooks. You can however have two companies open if you install QB into a laptop also. (They allow you one other install but only if you use the same industry edition. So for example if you have a manufacturing company and a retail business they have different industry editions)

So now onto the three pound monster; the color schemes. In 2012 you had the option of choosing an assortment of color schemes. You don't have that option in 2013. That wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that they chose colors that create headaches; well at least in some people.  I love the way 2010 looks. It is reminiscent of Outlook 2007 with its soft blues and grays. It is pleasant to look at and easy to read. 2013 has the same icons and choices (how are they going to improve on something in any major way that has been through a zillion years of tweaking to make it Intuit-ive?) BUT they changed it slightly with the biggest problem as I see it (no pun intended) is they included black backgrounds with reversed out white letters. Our eyes get adjusted to that, and then on the same page they have these super soft letters on a bright background which is a seismic shift. I can see what they mean that this could give you a headache after awhile. So I thought I would convert it some by minimizing the left side navigation pane, which is easy to do with one click of the mouse, but the problem is that when you use any one of the features such as invoicing, credit memos, estimates etc up comes those screens with the same black header reversed out and you can't change that.  On a cerebral-vision basis it is not conducive to reducing the workload, but rather increasing it. Your eyes and vision set have to constantly readjust depending on which part of the page you are focusing on.  As soon as you open the program and spend a few minutes with it, you immediate feeling will be how do I change the black headers only to find out you can't. The headers also give you a feeling of the old DOS days; it is real basic and the level of graphics is Neanderthal. The rest of the work area is fine. I don't have any problem with soft lettering, or the nicely colored icons; just change the headers, and/or include some color scheme changes.
What else is there?

I have been using Intuit products since the DOS days in the 80's. Easy to use, intuitive, and great for small businesses. There is no way they are not going to fix this. There are too many people complaining about it. It will have a devastating effect on sales. Intuit is the best and I am sure they will be updating by re-creating the color scheme choice like they had in 2012, or at the very least go back to the pleasant default color scheme in some earlier versions. If they don't hold onto your 2012 version because they are going to become more and more valuable especially if Intuit stops making the 2012 version.

UPDATE: Okay I am going to have to tip my hat because Intuit did ""correct"" the problem. Why do I put quotes around correct? I don't want to nit pick but I have to be critical. What they did with R6 free update (R9 is out now) is ""Company File Color Scheme"" option is introduced in the ""Desktop View"" preference to allow users to change the color of the title bar and the border of QuickBooks windows for a particular company file, which will help users to differentiate between multiple company files. This preference will be replacing the ""Company Color Flag"" preference introduced in R4 release. We are offering 14 different ""Company File Color Scheme"" options to apply on various company files. This is a user level preference, which essentially means that various users connected to the same company file can select different colors. (R6)

That was a copy and paste from Intuit of the improvement. What it means is that the title bars have been made adjustable into some really nice colors. My main concern was how the large black background area with white text was creating an eye set, if I can use that expression which was pretty bold, and then you had to re-adjust your eyes in order to see the fine print in lighted out gray in the forms etc. So it was a headache waiting to happen. At first I dismissed others comments but then saw exactly what they were saying, and had to agree with them. So what did Intuit do? They did not get rid of the large black background to the main menu on the left, BUT you can minimize that so it is a small border on the left side of the screen. Then they gave you this option to change the title bar color options with some beautiful colors, while at the same time changing the title bar titles themselves into all caps to help balance the visibility out. All in all it is very useable now.

In all fairness in my 2010 version the invoices for example have black backgrounds with white letters in the inner title bars but the black bars are a lot thinner. 2013 has large black bars still. BUT with the other changes it is very manageable, and I would now have to say that I give the whole program a triple thumbs up and 5 stars. I also must admit that the left main menu is easier to read with a black background and white letters, rather than a lesser contrast option so they did good. The fact that you can minimize that whole window, and then you are working almost exclusively in your color choice (and the ones they give you are beautiful) makes this a top drawer program. I am once again in love with Quickbooks, yes even the 2013 version.",5

 Positives:

 If you are already running version X4, the new features of X5 include a new ""Places"" Map mode with GoogleMaps integration that reads the GPS data your camera records as Exif information, the ability to organize photos using facial recognition into ""People"" groupings, enhancements to the ""Exposure Merge"" HDR tool including a single-RAW HDR mode, a new ""Graduated Filter"" effect, a new ""Retro Lab"" to give photos a vintage look, a new ""Instant Effects"" pop-up palette that lets you quickly try out many preset effects on a photo, better support for importing Adobe Photoshop brushes, the ability to run several scripts in sequence for batch processing of photos, and enhanced social media integration.
 PaintShop Pro has a very wide range of tools for both photo editing and graphic design, ranging from serious photography-specific tools to fun graphics manipulation.
 It combines photo editing, photo retouching, painting, drawing, graphics design, and image management in a single package.
 There are a great selection of photo enhancement tools, both to fix common photography issues and also more esoteric image manipulation tools.
 It also includes Web graphics tools for image mapping and slicing, and for coding image rollovers and Web button creation.
 This is very affordable, yet very powerful, currently selling on Amazon at a heavily discounted pricing of less than $50.
 It has a very useful ""Learning Center"" and video tutorials help photo-editing newbies learn the software and accomplish common tasks.
 The user interface is divided into three tabs, ""Manage"", ""Adjust"", ""Edit"", providing a usable workflow from initial photo review to final editing, and allowing you to configure, customize, and save how you use each workspace. You can also customize each toolbar individually.

 Negatives:

 In spite of many improvement over the years, PaintShop Pro still lacks an automated tool for stitching together overlapping adjacently-photographed photos to create panoramas.
 Even though the HDR ""Exposure Merge"" tool works fairly well, the tool is not always precise at aligning objects between bracketed shots and it is especially lacking in deghosting; both problems can arise from either camera movement or movement of objects in the scene.
 It has limited RAW file processing capabilities and compatibilities compared to Adobe Lightroom, but Corel intends for RAW handling to be better addressed in their AfterShot Pro software.
 As with some of Corel's other recent products, accessing the help documentation requires access to Corel's online Web site for information, instead of being able to access all help documentation locally on my computer directly from within the application.
 Despite being more uncluttered and streamlined than the previous X3 version's user interface, the ""Edit"" tab of this new user interface that was introduced in X4, which serves as the main workhorse for serious image editing, is still somewhat cluttered and disorganized, with overlapping functions and ambiguous groupings of tools, and this impacts the ergonomics and usability of the software, especially for new users.
 For the graphics newbie who has no previous experience using graphics software, there is a medium-to-high learning curve effort required to learn how to proficiently use the software. This software is not specifically designed for simple image manipulation by novices. If you are initially learning this software, you should start off just using the ""Adjust"" tab and not use the ""Edit"" tab; the ""Adjust"" tab is simplified and suitable to novices whereas the ""Edit"" tab is meant for power users.
 This is just a small nitpick, but this is a far smaller upgrade if you are upgrading from X4 to this X5 than compared to if you upgraded from X3 to X4.

I have always been a fan of PaintShop Pro throughout the 1990s and I have often kept updating PSP versions after Corel acquired its original developer, JASC Software, in 2004, even though I also have been updating versions of CorelDRAW Graphics Suite starting from CorelDRAW 5. Along with recently releasing ""Corel AfterShot Pro"" (after Corel acquired Bibble Labs and repackaged their ""Bibble Pro"" as ""AfterShot Pro"") and including Corel's original ""Photo-Paint"" photo-editor as part of the ""CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X6"", Corel now has three photo applications which have some overlapping functions and also unique abilities of their own. As a photo management application, AfterShot Pro is meant to complement PSP and compete against Adobe Photoshop Lightroom. I previously used both of Corel's PaintShop Pro and Corel's Photo-Paint software for photo editing, and even though recent versions of PaintShop Pro run slower than Photo-Paint due to code bloat from an ever-increasing set of features, PaintShop Pro remains my favorite ""Photoshop for the non-professional-graphics masses"" application, being more feature-packed and capable like Photoshop CS than Adobe's own Photoshop Elements 11.

The PSP X5 product features are described and rated below:

 Design & Features:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating:

 After Corel acquired JASC Software, they have been adding new features with each release, and even though this version runs and feels slower than earlier versions of PSP, I feel that it is a fair trade-off to allow the code bloat due to the number and complexity of features to slow the software down. With this latest X5 version, I get a powerful set of photo and graphics editing tools that is more useful than Photoshop Elements 11. PSP X5 pales in comparison to the power of the full-blown Photoshop CS, but with its significantly lower pricing and learning curve compared to Photoshop CS, it is obviously meant to compete against software like Photoshop Elements, which it handily outperforms. The rich set of tools included in PSP range from very specific goal-oriented adjustments like the ""Selective Focus"" tool that simulates the effect of tilt-shift lenses to tools that are very friendly to use by newbies such as 'One Step Photo Fix', 'Smart Photo Fix', and 'One Step Noise Removal'.

 Along with the ""Effect Browser"" that was introduced with the previous X4 version, this X5 version now includes a new ""Instant Effects"" palette. There seems to be a confusing overlap between both the ""Effect Browser"" menu options and the ""Instant Effects"" palette options. Both options help you navigate through the plethora of tools and effects, instead of accessing each effect one by one. The dialog box window for the ""Effect Browser"" has not been updated to match the stylish user interface, and it still has the old Windows-expanding-folder-tree appearance of old PSP versions, while the ""Instant Effects"" palette matches the look-and-feel of other palette options. The ""Effect Browser"" displays thumbnails of the actual image that you are editing, with each effect applied to the thumbnail image, whereas the ""Instant Effects"" displays the same example thumbnails instead of showing you a thumbnail of what each effect would look like using your own image. I do like the ""Effect Browser"" approach of applying the effect on my own image instead of the new ""Instant Effects"" display of generic thumbnail images though. The ""Effect Browser"" also groups the effects by tool type (e.g. ""Blur"", ""Color"", ""Hue and Saturation"", ""Sharpness""), while the ""Instant Effects"" palette groups the effects by image style (e.g. ""Black and White"", ""Film Styles"", ""Landscape"", ""Portrait"").

 The previous X4 version introduced the HDR (High Dynamic Range) ""Exposure Merge"" tool that is Corel's foray into HDR software, which Adobe and other graphics software vendors are also incorporating into their tools. HDR processing involves combining multiple exposures of the exact same shot (which is easier if your camera has an Automatic Exposure Bracketing (AEB) function) to create a high dynamic range photo which can display a higher tonal range than what the camera is capable of capturing in a single exposure. There are various software specifically dedicated to HDR processing. For the past five years, since version 3 in 2008, I have been using the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Photomatix-Pro-4/dp/B002CIP12U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Photomatix Pro 4</a>&nbsp;software for HDR processing. This X5 version of ""Exposure Merge"" adds new black-and-white HDR controls and a very useful ""Preview Alignment"" option to visually inspect the positioning of your merged photos. There is also a new ""single RAW photo"" option where you can create an HDR photo using a single RAW image by defining an ""EV Interval"" to simulate a triple-bracketed shot, and the software will then split the single RAW image into three exposures before combining them together. This single-shot-HDR option is also offered by both ""Photomatix"" and ""DxO Optics Pro"" software.

On a relative scale specifically rating its HDR functions, I would rate Photomatix 5 fuzzy stars while this PSP X5's HDR ""Exposure Merge"" tool only gets 3.5 fuzzy stars rating. This X5 ""Exposure Merge"" is improved over the X4 version, which I would rate at 3.0 stars. But both Corel and Adobe still have a long way to catch up with the powerful and flexible offerings in Photomatix. In particular, I found the ""Exposure Merge"" tool in PSP to be lacking in its ability to precisely align bracketed photos and thoroughly and flexibly remove ghosting artifacts, which is something that Photomatix does a very good job at. If you use a tripod-mounted camera to shoot bracketed photos where nothing in the scene moves the least bit, then the ""Exposure Merge"" tool consistently outputs good HDR results. But when shooting portraits or landscapes, or shooting hand-held, bracketed photos often have misaligned objects and/or moving objects in the shots. Even bracketed portrait shots of a person using a tripod can result in tiny movements by the person that require excellent alignment and deghosting by HDR software, and Photomatix currently beats PSP's ""Exposure Merge"" tool in this area. PSP's ""Exposure Merge"" tool frequently has ghosting artifacts leftover either from movement of the camera by the photographer or movement of objects in the scene. This ghosting is especially evident in scenes such as landscapes where various plants may be moving in the breeze or portraits where the subject has slightly moved in between each bracketed shot. Photomatix also includes a plethora of other tone mapping, image stacking, and on-the-fly editing adjustments, including being able to define specific areas of photos to deghost and specific areas of photos where I can use the original image instead of the HDR output. I use these Photomatix functions a lot because I always aim for very natural-looking HDR images, instead of the surreal psychedelic HDR images that are, all too often, output by people. HDR software can be abused to create unnatural over-saturated photos that become tiresome to look at. Using Photomatix on an image of people set against a beautiful background landscape, I can tell the software to use an original un-HDR'ed exposure of a photo for the people's faces while letting the software HDR-process the rest of the landscape, and this is very useful to me because HDR-processed skin tones can sometimes look unnatural. PSP's ""Exposure Merge"" tool cannot perform these functions that I described. So a good HDR workflow would be to HDR-process your bracketed photos first using Photomatix, and then further edit the HDR output in PSP, perhaps performing some sharpening as the last step before saving the files.

 PSP X5 include a new ""Places"" Map mode with GoogleMaps integration that reads the GPS data your camera records as Exif information. This helps you map your photos and you can manually add location information by drag-and-dropping photos onto a map, or by using GPS data or Facebook check-in points. The ""Places"" section also lets you organize your photos based on location groupings.

 Related to the GoogleMaps integration in X5, there is a new ""Share My Trip"" project option that lets you use location information to place your vacation photos on an interactive map. You can share your map as a slideshow which you can post on a blog or upload directly to your Dropbox or Facebook account.

 X5 has enhanced social media integration, which lets you upload photos simultaneously to your Facebook, Flickr, and Google+ accounts. This sharing functionality was introduced in version X4, and has been expanded for X5.

 Similar to the ""Places"" groupings, you can now organize photos using the software's facial recognition ability into ""People"" groupings.

 There is a new and really cool ""Retro Lab"" that lets you apply effects that were inspired by vintage-style pocket cameras such as LOMO, Diana, or Holga. This trendy photo style pushes an image's color and contrast beyond its natural appearance, often with blurred or vignette edges. More than just a collection of single-click filters, ""Retro Lab"" also lets you personalize your own retro style and you can save your settings as a custom preset for future use.

 A new ""Graduated Filter"" effect in the ""Photo Effects"" menu lets you apply a semi-transparent color gradient to your photos which simulates the effect of using a graduated filter on a camera lens. For example, you can darken or tint a sky that appears washed out without affecting other areas of the photo. There are four gradient styles, a color picker, and opacity, blend, and rotation controls.

 The ""Layers"" palette now includes a [Layer Styles] button, making it easier to access and apply Bevel, Drop Shadow, Emboss, Inner Glow, Outer Glow, and Reflection styles. New controls for size, opacity, and color can be adjusted for each Layer Style.

 If you use PSP's scripting abilities to automate common workflows, X5 adds a new ""Run Multiple Scripts"" option that lets you chain together multiple scripts to run in sequence. This is a very handy option that I use a lot!

 Various other incremental improvements have been added to this X5 version. The ""Crop"" tool now has a rule-of-thirds grid and presets for common image sizes. The ""Text"" tool works better and more intuitively with the ""Pick"" tool for quicker and more accurate positioning of text; text positioning was sometimes a source of irritation for me in the previous X3 and X4 versions.

 Although Corel hopes that users perform RAW conversion using their ""AfterShot Pro"" software (which was formerly ""Bibble Pro"" before Corel acquired Bibble Labs), PSP X5 still includes its ""Camera RAW Lab"" for RAW conversion. The previous X4 version added useful highlight recovery options to recover details in overexposed regions of a photo. But, unfortunately, this X5 version has no improvements to the ""Camera RAW Lab"".

 Ergonomics, Usability & Ease of Use:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating

 Introduced in the previous X4 version, the user interface has three separate, yet integrated, workflow interfaces, designated by tabs across the top of the program window: ""Manage"", ""Adjust"", ""Edit"". The ""Photo Organizer"" in previous versions is now replaced by an ""Organizer"" palette which is available from all three workflow tabs.

 The ""Manage"" tab is where you browse, review, and rate images, edit metadata, and create collections of photos. This workspace lets you review and organize your photo files. Using the navigation palette, you can select an entire photo folder on your computer, narrow the selection according to one or more tags that you have assigned to photos, or narrow the selection according to the ratings that you have assigned to photos. The palette also shows basic Exif information about a photo.

 The ""Adjust"" tab is where you can make photo adjustments using a subset of the most common tools such as sharpening, color balance, brightness/contrast, fill light, clarity, tone mapping, noise removal, cropping, straightening, red-eye removal, or using its various built-in touch-up tools. Edits can also be applied to batches of files. This tab only offers a portion of the tools that are all available from the ""Edit"" tab. Its interface is cleaner and far less busy than the ""Edit"" tab, and because of its simpler layout, it makes an ideal interface for beginning users who are just starting to learn the software.

 The ""Edit"" tab includes all of the entire sets of tools for photo editing, drawing, painting, and graphic design work. By contrast, the ""Adjust"" tab offers only a subset of what can be accessed from the ""Edit"" tab. I think of the ""Adjust"" tab as being designed for novice newbies and beginning-intermediate levels of users, who often are not exactly sure what is wrong with their photo and how specifically to correct/adjust it, and the ""Edit"" tab is designed for advanced power users like me who want to have direct access to all the tools. If you are just starting out with graphics software, I recommend that you begin your photo editing from the ""Adjust"" tab, and then later as you become more proficient with the software, you can ignore this tab and always proceed directly to the ""Edit"" tab. The ""Adjust"" tab is much cleaner with its presentation of tools grouped into a handful of categories on the left side of the user interface and four menu options along the top, whereas the ""Edit"" tab lets you access every possible tool in its comprehensive tool chest and eleven menu options along the top. Overall, I think that this three-tab design strikes a happy balance that addresses the needs of both new users and power users.

 While the ""Manage"" and ""Adjust"" tabs are more simpler, clean, and organized in their user interface layouts, the ""Edit"" tab feels very busy and crowded, and it can be hard to find tools, especially when you are initially familiarizing yourself with all of the software's dozens of tools. And to add to this ergonomics and usability issue, the main menu on the ""Edit"" tab divides the tools into two menu options: 'Adjust' and 'Effects'. The ""Adjust"" tab includes a subset of options that are listed under the 'Adjust' menu option on the ""Edit"" tab. One ambiguous example is that under the 'Adjust' main menu option of the ""Edit"" tab, there is a 'Brightness and Contrast' option that then opens up a submenu containing the 'Fill Light/Clarity' tool. But the 'Adjust' menu also lists a similar tool called 'Fill Flash'. Both the 'Fill Light/Clarity' and 'Fill Flash' tools have a similar function, but neither the printed User Manual nor the online ""Help Topics"" documentation explain what the differences between both tools are. At a minimum, the 'Fill Flash' tool also needs to be moved into the submenu below the 'Brightness and Contrast' option. Ideally, both 'Fill Flash', which has 'Strength' and 'Saturation' slider settings, and 'Fill Light/Clarity', which has 'Fill Light' and 'Clarity' slider settings, should be combined into a single tool window containing three or four sliders, instead of confusing users as to which of these two tools to use.

 The software links to a variety of searchable online help and built-in tutorials. As with some of their other recent software releases, including the previous PSP X4, Corel has the help documentation in this PSP X5 set up so that clicking on the 'Help' option from the menu and then selecting 'Help Topics' starts up your browser and takes you to Corel's Web site where all of the help topics are accessible online and can also be searched. I really wished that Corel gave the user the option, during the initial software CD installation process, to either install the entire help documentation locally on the computer or to link the software to Corel's online Web site. After all, being dependent upon online access in order to access help information can be problematic if the user needs to search the 'Help Topics' from a place where there is no Internet access. On October 2 2012, Corel released a 76-MB 'PSPX5_LocalHelp.exe' patch that does install all of the help files locally on the computer, but after I installed this patch, clicking the 'Help Topics' still always brings up my browser and opens up a new Web page to display Corel's online help content. And there does not seem to be a way to configure PSP X5 to default to offline mode and use the locally-installed help files even when no Internet connection is available. But you can still manually access the locally-installed help files by directly pointing your browser at the directory path where all of the help files are installed. The main Web page for the help files is located in the directory path below:

32-bit C:\Program Files\Corel\Corel PaintShop Pro X5\Languages\EN\Help\wwhelp\wwhimpl\js\html\wwhelp.htm
64-bit: C:\Program Files (x86)\Corel\Corel PaintShop Pro X5\Languages\EN\Help\wwhelp\wwhimpl\js\html\wwhelp.htm

If your PSP install also constantly redirects you to Corel's Web site after installing the help files locally, you can point your Web browser to this location to access the locally-installed help files. This locally-installed help documentation page, complete with a search function, works well using either Internet Explorer or Safari browsers, but Firefox just displays a blank two-framed page.

 My one main gripe about this and all previous versions of PSP is that it still does not have a tool for stitching together panoramic photos. Photoshop has the ""Photomerge"" utility and Canon has ""PhotoStitch"" for creating panorama photos. But PaintShop Pro and also Corel's Photo-Paint in their Graphics Suite package have been missing this very useful functionality for a long time. Corel really needs to add a panorama merge/stitch function to their ever-increasing rich set of tools. The current way to create a panoramic photo in PSP is an entirely manual and laborious process. You first create a new canvas that is large enough to hold all of the expected overlapping photos, you then copy each photo into a separate layer, decrease the opacity of one layer so you can see through it while you manually move the layer around to visually align the edges of one photo with the overlapping portion of another photo, and you repeat this tedious process for all overlapping photos that will be used in the panorama before setting the layers' opacities back to 100%. Needless to say, this is both time-consuming and highly prone to error, and the manually merged result only works if you shot the overlapping photos using a tripod with a panning head and a very level camera. By comparison, Canon's ""PhotoStitch"" program is very user-friendly and flexible with its options, and it automatically aligns and merges photos in the order that you specify.

 Performance, Stability, Reliability:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating

 Compared to previous versions of PSP, this X5 version has pretty good stability. During almost one year of weekly usage before writing this review, I have had the software crash or hang about 3 or 4 times total, and this includes running the software on an old underpowered Windows Vista laptop and a tiny Windows 7 Dell Mini 10 netbook. Corel has obviously worked on adding stability with this version, along with GPU optimizations.

 Speed has been noticeably improved, the performance is considerably faster than previous versions, start-up time to launch the program for the first time has been improved, and these improvements are especially apparent when running PSP X5 on an older slower computer. When used on my 5-year old Windows Vista laptop with 2GB memory, applying most effects happens in real-time, and for some operations such as adjusting sharpening parameters on 100-MB TIFF image files, the pop-up preview window will still display a progress meter, but these progress meters only last for a few seconds on this older laptop of mine.

 This X5 version uses less than 400 MB of disk space on a full install. The previous X4 version used about 900 MB of disk space, and version X3 required 3GB of disk space, which tells me that prior to X4, PSP had become very bloated and disorganized. So this redesign both increased performance and reduced the disk space required. By comparison, Adobe's Photoshop Elements 11 requires a whopping 3GB to 4GB of disk space, even though it has less features and effects than PSP.

 Competitive Pricing & Value:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating

 At the time of this review's writing, PaintShop Pro X5 is being discounted on Amazon at a price less than $35, and its price is less than Amazon's price for Photoshop Elements 11, even though PSPX4 is a more capable and better program! With the Amazon discounting, this is truly a bargain for the amount of photo and graphics editing power that you get.

 Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:

For overall bang-for-the-buck combination of very affordable value and feature-packed power in a commercial photo-editing software package, this PSP X5 currently reigns supreme, beating out Adobe Photoshop Elements 11 and all other photo-editing software that I can think of. If you want something even less expensive, look into a freeware graphics software called ""GIMP"" which offers a ton of graphics editing power for free. And if you have no experience with graphics software or if you do not want to spend time learning its complexities, look into the free and easy-to-use software called ""Paint. NET"".

Despite the significant performance improvements in versions X4 and X5 (they are roughly 50% to 100% faster than X3 and also far more stable), it still does have its slow areas of laggardly performance. In particular, this is not a good software for processing RAW files, both due to its slow RAW converter and due to its limited RAW compatibility.

If you want the deluxe photo management and editing solution, deluxe in capability, cost, and complexity, using Adobe's Lightroom and Photoshop CS are the way to go. Otherwise, this PSP X5 is an excellent ""Photoshop for the masses"" alternative. If you primarily shoot in RAW, adding Corel's AfterShot Pro allows for great RAW handling followed by photo editing in PSP X5. And if Corel's HDR feature in PSP X5 has whetted your appetite for HDR processing, you should seriously consider getting Photomatix Pro (currently at version 4) since its capabilities exceed anything that Corel or Adobe has to offer.

If you are using a version of PaintShop Pro prior to X4, is this PSP X5 worth the upgrade?

Most definitely! There were many dozens of improvements in going from X3 to X4. Even if you ignore all of its new features and enhancements, just the fact that X4 and X5 run a lot faster and are more stable than X3 is a compelling enough reason to upgrade. However, the improvements in going from X4 to X5 are more incremental; there were far more improvements in going from X3 to X4. But with a good discounted price, it is still worthy upgrading from X4 to X5.

If you are just starting out with photo-editing, should you buy this PSP X5 or Adobe Photoshop Elements 11?

I feel that PSP X5 is a far more capable and feature-rich program than Adobe Photoshop Elements 11. PSP X5 is more like the full-blown Photoshop CS version than APE11. APE11 includes more built-in layer styles that PSP X5 does not have, although if you are just starting out, you will not miss this. Once you become proficient in PSP X5, you can create your own styles and record them as scripts to repeatedly reuse. Photoshop Elements has a much larger user base than PSP, and there are numerous sites to download brushes and textures from, but it is easy to convert Photoshop brushes to use in PSP, so that is not really a problem. APE11 has more adjustment brushes than PSP X5 when it comes to brushing on effects like dodge, burn, and saturation. But PSP X5 has more artistic tools than APE11, useful for painting, drawing, scrapbooking, and graphic design, and PSP X5 is more useful and flexible for manipulating images other than photos than APE11. PSP X5 requires less than one third the disk space to install than APE11, and at the time of this review's writing, Amazon has it priced lower than APE11, even though PSP X5 is far more packed with features. But... if you think that you will eventually migrate up to Photoshop CS, which is far more complex, powerful, and expensive, then starting out with APE11 will give you skills that are more transferable to Photoshop CS than becoming proficient with PSP X5.

One final note: On August 2013, Corel released a ""Service Pack 3"" patch that provides various enhancements and bug fixes. After installing PaintShop Pro X5 on your computer, you can either download this 98-MB executable from Corel's Web site, or from the user interface, click 'Help' and ""Check for Updates"" to download and install the service pack that way. You should definitely install this service pack .",5

 Positives:

 If you are already running version X4, the new features of X5 include a new ""Places"" Map mode with GoogleMaps integration that reads the GPS data your camera records as Exif information, the ability to organize photos using facial recognition into ""People"" groupings, enhancements to the ""Exposure Merge"" HDR tool including a single-RAW HDR mode, a new ""Graduated Filter"" effect, a new ""Retro Lab"" to give photos a vintage look, a new ""Instant Effects"" pop-up palette that lets you quickly try out many preset effects on a photo, better support for importing Adobe Photoshop brushes, the ability to run several scripts in sequence for batch processing of photos, and enhanced social media integration.
 PaintShop Pro has a very wide range of tools for both photo editing and graphic design, ranging from serious photography-specific tools to fun graphics manipulation.
 It combines photo editing, photo retouching, painting, drawing, graphics design, and image management in a single package.
 There are a great selection of photo enhancement tools, both to fix common photography issues and also more esoteric image manipulation tools.
 It also includes Web graphics tools for image mapping and slicing, and for coding image rollovers and Web button creation.
 This is very affordable, yet very powerful, currently selling on Amazon at a heavily discounted pricing of less than $50.
 It has a very useful ""Learning Center"" and video tutorials help photo-editing newbies learn the software and accomplish common tasks.
 The user interface is divided into three tabs, ""Manage"", ""Adjust"", ""Edit"", providing a usable workflow from initial photo review to final editing, and allowing you to configure, customize, and save how you use each workspace. You can also customize each toolbar individually.

 Negatives:

 In spite of many improvement over the years, PaintShop Pro still lacks an automated tool for stitching together overlapping adjacently-photographed photos to create panoramas.
 Even though the HDR ""Exposure Merge"" tool works fairly well, the tool is not always precise at aligning objects between bracketed shots and it is especially lacking in deghosting; both problems can arise from either camera movement or movement of objects in the scene.
 It has limited RAW file processing capabilities and compatibilities compared to Adobe Lightroom, but Corel intends for RAW handling to be better addressed in their AfterShot Pro software.
 As with some of Corel's other recent products, accessing the help documentation requires access to Corel's online Web site for information, instead of being able to access all help documentation locally on my computer directly from within the application.
 Despite being more uncluttered and streamlined than the previous X3 version's user interface, the ""Edit"" tab of this new user interface that was introduced in X4, which serves as the main workhorse for serious image editing, is still somewhat cluttered and disorganized, with overlapping functions and ambiguous groupings of tools, and this impacts the ergonomics and usability of the software, especially for new users.
 For the graphics newbie who has no previous experience using graphics software, there is a medium-to-high learning curve effort required to learn how to proficiently use the software. This software is not specifically designed for simple image manipulation by novices. If you are initially learning this software, you should start off just using the ""Adjust"" tab and not use the ""Edit"" tab; the ""Adjust"" tab is simplified and suitable to novices whereas the ""Edit"" tab is meant for power users.
 This is just a small nitpick, but this is a far smaller upgrade if you are upgrading from X4 to this X5 than compared to if you upgraded from X3 to X4.

I have always been a fan of PaintShop Pro throughout the 1990s and I have often kept updating PSP versions after Corel acquired its original developer, JASC Software, in 2004, even though I also have been updating versions of CorelDRAW Graphics Suite starting from CorelDRAW 5. Along with recently releasing ""Corel AfterShot Pro"" (after Corel acquired Bibble Labs and repackaged their ""Bibble Pro"" as ""AfterShot Pro"") and including Corel's original ""Photo-Paint"" photo-editor as part of the ""CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X6"", Corel now has three photo applications which have some overlapping functions and also unique abilities of their own. As a photo management application, AfterShot Pro is meant to complement PSP and compete against Adobe Photoshop Lightroom. I previously used both of Corel's PaintShop Pro and Corel's Photo-Paint software for photo editing, and even though recent versions of PaintShop Pro run slower than Photo-Paint due to code bloat from an ever-increasing set of features, PaintShop Pro remains my favorite ""Photoshop for the non-professional-graphics masses"" application, being more feature-packed and capable like Photoshop CS than Adobe's own Photoshop Elements 11.

What is in the box package of this PaintShop Pro X5 Ultimate edition?

 PaintShop Pro X5 software CD (for Windows 8/7/Vista/XP)
 A second ""Ultimate Pack"" CD with Nik Color Efex Pro 3.0, FaceFilter Studio 2, and a ""Creative Collection"" of royalty-free stock photos, and dozens of brushes, textures, and presets

The PSP X5 product features are described and rated below:

 Design & Features:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating:

 After Corel acquired JASC Software, they have been adding new features with each release, and even though this version runs and feels slower than earlier versions of PSP, I feel that it is a fair trade-off to allow the code bloat due to the number and complexity of features to slow the software down. With this latest X5 version, I get a powerful set of photo and graphics editing tools that is more useful than Photoshop Elements 11. PSP X5 pales in comparison to the power of the full-blown Photoshop CS, but with its significantly lower pricing and learning curve compared to Photoshop CS, it is obviously meant to compete against software like Photoshop Elements, which it handily outperforms. The rich set of tools included in PSP range from very specific goal-oriented adjustments like the ""Selective Focus"" tool that simulates the effect of tilt-shift lenses to tools that are very friendly to use by newbies such as 'One Step Photo Fix', 'Smart Photo Fix', and 'One Step Noise Removal'. This ""Ultimate"" version of PSP X5 adds even more power and value by including the award-winning Nik Color Efex Pro 3.0 photographic filters, which includes 52 photographic filters that can be applied to images to give them special effects. The ""Ultimate"" version also includes Reallusion's ""FaceFilter Studio 2"", which lets you digitally give a face-lift to portraits, change facial expressions, smooth out wrinkles and skin blemishes, and perform operations that professional editors use to make fashion models look perfect in magazine ads. Also included in this Ultimate version is a ""Creative Collection"", which has more than 100 royalty-free stock photos and over 25 unique brushes, and dozens of new textures and presets.

When installing the ""FaceFilter Studio 2"" application from the CD, if the installation procedure rejects your entered serial number, do not include the preceding ""SKRRFF2"" when entering the FaceFilter serial number.

 Along with the ""Effect Browser"" that was introduced with the previous X4 version, this X5 version now includes a new ""Instant Effects"" palette. There seems to be a confusing overlap between both the ""Effect Browser"" menu options and the ""Instant Effects"" palette options. Both options help you navigate through the plethora of tools and effects, instead of accessing each effect one by one. The dialog box window for the ""Effect Browser"" has not been updated to match the stylish user interface, and it still has the old Windows-expanding-folder-tree appearance of old PSP versions, while the ""Instant Effects"" palette matches the look-and-feel of other palette options. The ""Effect Browser"" displays thumbnails of the actual image that you are editing, with each effect applied to the thumbnail image, whereas the ""Instant Effects"" displays the same example thumbnails instead of showing you a thumbnail of what each effect would look like using your own image. I do like the ""Effect Browser"" approach of applying the effect on my own image instead of the new ""Instant Effects"" display of generic thumbnail images though. The ""Effect Browser"" also groups the effects by tool type (e.g. ""Blur"", ""Color"", ""Hue and Saturation"", ""Sharpness""), while the ""Instant Effects"" palette groups the effects by image style (e.g. ""Black and White"", ""Film Styles"", ""Landscape"", ""Portrait"").

 The previous X4 version introduced the HDR (High Dynamic Range) ""Exposure Merge"" tool that is Corel's foray into HDR software, which Adobe and other graphics software vendors are also incorporating into their tools. HDR processing involves combining multiple exposures of the exact same shot (which is easier if your camera has an Automatic Exposure Bracketing (AEB) function) to create a high dynamic range photo which can display a higher tonal range than what the camera is capable of capturing in a single exposure. There are various software specifically dedicated to HDR processing. For the past five years, since version 3 in 2008, I have been using the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Photomatix-Pro-4/dp/B002CIP12U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Photomatix Pro 4</a>&nbsp;software for HDR processing. This X5 version of ""Exposure Merge"" adds new black-and-white HDR controls and a very useful ""Preview Alignment"" option to visually inspect the positioning of your merged photos. There is also a new ""single RAW photo"" option where you can create an HDR photo using a single RAW image by defining an ""EV Interval"" to simulate a triple-bracketed shot, and the software will then split the single RAW image into three exposures before combining them together. This single-shot-HDR option is also offered by both ""Photomatix"" and ""DxO Optics Pro"" software.

On a relative scale specifically rating its HDR functions, I would rate Photomatix 5 fuzzy stars while this PSP X5's HDR ""Exposure Merge"" tool only gets 3.5 fuzzy stars rating. This X5 ""Exposure Merge"" is improved over the X4 version, which I would rate at 3.0 stars. But both Corel and Adobe still have a long way to catch up with the powerful and flexible offerings in Photomatix. In particular, I found the ""Exposure Merge"" tool in PSP to be lacking in its ability to precisely align bracketed photos and thoroughly and flexibly remove ghosting artifacts, which is something that Photomatix does a very good job at. If you use a tripod-mounted camera to shoot bracketed photos where nothing in the scene moves the least bit, then the ""Exposure Merge"" tool consistently outputs good HDR results. But when shooting portraits or landscapes, or shooting hand-held, bracketed photos often have misaligned objects and/or moving objects in the shots. Even bracketed portrait shots of a person using a tripod can result in tiny movements by the person that require excellent alignment and deghosting by HDR software, and Photomatix currently beats PSP's ""Exposure Merge"" tool in this area. PSP's ""Exposure Merge"" tool frequently has ghosting artifacts leftover either from movement of the camera by the photographer or movement of objects in the scene. This ghosting is especially evident in scenes such as landscapes where various plants may be moving in the breeze or portraits where the subject has slightly moved in between each bracketed shot. Photomatix also includes a plethora of other tone mapping, image stacking, and on-the-fly editing adjustments, including being able to define specific areas of photos to deghost and specific areas of photos where I can use the original image instead of the HDR output. I use these Photomatix functions a lot because I always aim for very natural-looking HDR images, instead of the surreal psychedelic HDR images that are, all too often, output by people. HDR software can be abused to create unnatural over-saturated photos that become tiresome to look at. Using Photomatix on an image of people set against a beautiful background landscape, I can tell the software to use an original un-HDR'ed exposure of a photo for the people's faces while letting the software HDR-process the rest of the landscape, and this is very useful to me because HDR-processed skin tones can sometimes look unnatural. PSP's ""Exposure Merge"" tool cannot perform these functions that I described. So a good HDR workflow would be to HDR-process your bracketed photos first using Photomatix, and then further edit the HDR output in PSP, perhaps performing some sharpening as the last step before saving the files.

 PSP X5 include a new ""Places"" Map mode with GoogleMaps integration that reads the GPS data your camera records as Exif information. This helps you map your photos and you can manually add location information by drag-and-dropping photos onto a map, or by using GPS data or Facebook check-in points. The ""Places"" section also lets you organize your photos based on location groupings.

 Related to the GoogleMaps integration in X5, there is a new ""Share My Trip"" project option that lets you use location information to place your vacation photos on an interactive map. You can share your map as a slideshow which you can post on a blog or upload directly to your Dropbox or Facebook account.

 X5 has enhanced social media integration, which lets you upload photos simultaneously to your Facebook, Flickr, and Google+ accounts. This sharing functionality was introduced in version X4, and has been expanded for X5.

 Similar to the ""Places"" groupings, you can now organize photos using the software's facial recognition ability into ""People"" groupings.

 There is a new and really cool ""Retro Lab"" that lets you apply effects that were inspired by vintage-style pocket cameras such as LOMO, Diana, or Holga. This trendy photo style pushes an image's color and contrast beyond its natural appearance, often with blurred or vignette edges. More than just a collection of single-click filters, ""Retro Lab"" also lets you personalize your own retro style and you can save your settings as a custom preset for future use.

 A new ""Graduated Filter"" effect in the ""Photo Effects"" menu lets you apply a semi-transparent color gradient to your photos which simulates the effect of using a graduated filter on a camera lens. For example, you can darken or tint a sky that appears washed out without affecting other areas of the photo. There are four gradient styles, a color picker, and opacity, blend, and rotation controls.

 The ""Layers"" palette now includes a [Layer Styles] button, making it easier to access and apply Bevel, Drop Shadow, Emboss, Inner Glow, Outer Glow, and Reflection styles. New controls for size, opacity, and color can be adjusted for each Layer Style.

 If you use PSP's scripting abilities to automate common workflows, X5 adds a new ""Run Multiple Scripts"" option that lets you chain together multiple scripts to run in sequence. This is a very handy option that I use a lot!

 Various other incremental improvements have been added to this X5 version. The ""Crop"" tool now has a rule-of-thirds grid and presets for common image sizes. The ""Text"" tool works better and more intuitively with the ""Pick"" tool for quicker and more accurate positioning of text; text positioning was sometimes a source of irritation for me in the previous X3 and X4 versions.

 Although Corel hopes that users perform RAW conversion using their ""AfterShot Pro"" software (which was formerly ""Bibble Pro"" before Corel acquired Bibble Labs), PSP X5 still includes its ""Camera RAW Lab"" for RAW conversion. The previous X4 version added useful highlight recovery options to recover details in overexposed regions of a photo. But, unfortunately, this X5 version has no improvements to the ""Camera RAW Lab"".

 Ergonomics, Usability & Ease of Use:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating

 Introduced in the previous X4 version, the user interface has three separate, yet integrated, workflow interfaces, designated by tabs across the top of the program window: ""Manage"", ""Adjust"", ""Edit"". The ""Photo Organizer"" in previous versions is now replaced by an ""Organizer"" palette which is available from all three workflow tabs.

 The ""Manage"" tab is where you browse, review, and rate images, edit metadata, and create collections of photos. This workspace lets you review and organize your photo files. Using the navigation palette, you can select an entire photo folder on your computer, narrow the selection according to one or more tags that you have assigned to photos, or narrow the selection according to the ratings that you have assigned to photos. The palette also shows basic Exif information about a photo.

 The ""Adjust"" tab is where you can make photo adjustments using a subset of the most common tools such as sharpening, color balance, brightness/contrast, fill light, clarity, tone mapping, noise removal, cropping, straightening, red-eye removal, or using its various built-in touch-up tools. Edits can also be applied to batches of files. This tab only offers a portion of the tools that are all available from the ""Edit"" tab. Its interface is cleaner and far less busy than the ""Edit"" tab, and because of its simpler layout, it makes an ideal interface for beginning users who are just starting to learn the software.

 The ""Edit"" tab includes all of the entire sets of tools for photo editing, drawing, painting, and graphic design work. By contrast, the ""Adjust"" tab offers only a subset of what can be accessed from the ""Edit"" tab. I think of the ""Adjust"" tab as being designed for novice newbies and beginning-intermediate levels of users, who often are not exactly sure what is wrong with their photo and how specifically to correct/adjust it, and the ""Edit"" tab is designed for advanced power users like me who want to have direct access to all the tools. If you are just starting out with graphics software, I recommend that you begin your photo editing from the ""Adjust"" tab, and then later as you become more proficient with the software, you can ignore this tab and always proceed directly to the ""Edit"" tab. The ""Adjust"" tab is much cleaner with its presentation of tools grouped into a handful of categories on the left side of the user interface and four menu options along the top, whereas the ""Edit"" tab lets you access every possible tool in its comprehensive tool chest and eleven menu options along the top. Overall, I think that this three-tab design strikes a happy balance that addresses the needs of both new users and power users.

 While the ""Manage"" and ""Adjust"" tabs are more simpler, clean, and organized in their user interface layouts, the ""Edit"" tab feels very busy and crowded, and it can be hard to find tools, especially when you are initially familiarizing yourself with all of the software's dozens of tools. And to add to this ergonomics and usability issue, the main menu on the ""Edit"" tab divides the tools into two menu options: 'Adjust' and 'Effects'. The ""Adjust"" tab includes a subset of options that are listed under the 'Adjust' menu option on the ""Edit"" tab. One ambiguous example is that under the 'Adjust' main menu option of the ""Edit"" tab, there is a 'Brightness and Contrast' option that then opens up a submenu containing the 'Fill Light/Clarity' tool. But the 'Adjust' menu also lists a similar tool called 'Fill Flash'. Both the 'Fill Light/Clarity' and 'Fill Flash' tools have a similar function, but neither the printed User Manual nor the online ""Help Topics"" documentation explain what the differences between both tools are. At a minimum, the 'Fill Flash' tool also needs to be moved into the submenu below the 'Brightness and Contrast' option. Ideally, both 'Fill Flash', which has 'Strength' and 'Saturation' slider settings, and 'Fill Light/Clarity', which has 'Fill Light' and 'Clarity' slider settings, should be combined into a single tool window containing three or four sliders, instead of confusing users as to which of these two tools to use.

 The software links to a variety of searchable online help and built-in tutorials. As with some of their other recent software releases, including the previous PSP X4, Corel has the help documentation in this PSP X5 set up so that clicking on the 'Help' option from the menu and then selecting 'Help Topics' starts up your browser and takes you to Corel's Web site where all of the help topics are accessible online and can also be searched. I really wished that Corel gave the user the option, during the initial software CD installation process, to either install the entire help documentation locally on the computer or to link the software to Corel's online Web site. After all, being dependent upon online access in order to access help information can be problematic if the user needs to search the 'Help Topics' from a place where there is no Internet access. On October 2 2012, Corel released a 76-MB 'PSPX5_LocalHelp.exe' patch that does install all of the help files locally on the computer, but after I installed this patch, clicking the 'Help Topics' still always brings up my browser and opens up a new Web page to display Corel's online help content. And there does not seem to be a way to configure PSP X5 to default to offline mode and use the locally-installed help files even when no Internet connection is available. But you can still manually access the locally-installed help files by directly pointing your browser at the directory path where all of the help files are installed. The main Web page for the help files is located in the directory path below:

32-bit C:\Program Files\Corel\Corel PaintShop Pro X5\Languages\EN\Help\wwhelp\wwhimpl\js\html\wwhelp.htm
64-bit: C:\Program Files (x86)\Corel\Corel PaintShop Pro X5\Languages\EN\Help\wwhelp\wwhimpl\js\html\wwhelp.htm

If your PSP install also constantly redirects you to Corel's Web site after installing the help files locally, you can point your Web browser to this location to access the locally-installed help files. This locally-installed help documentation page, complete with a search function, works well using either Internet Explorer or Safari browsers, but Firefox just displays a blank two-framed page.

 My one main gripe about this and all previous versions of PSP is that it still does not have a tool for stitching together panoramic photos. Photoshop has the ""Photomerge"" utility and Canon has ""PhotoStitch"" for creating panorama photos. But PaintShop Pro and also Corel's Photo-Paint in their Graphics Suite package have been missing this very useful functionality for a long time. Corel really needs to add a panorama merge/stitch function to their ever-increasing rich set of tools. The current way to create a panoramic photo in PSP is an entirely manual and laborious process. You first create a new canvas that is large enough to hold all of the expected overlapping photos, you then copy each photo into a separate layer, decrease the opacity of one layer so you can see through it while you manually move the layer around to visually align the edges of one photo with the overlapping portion of another photo, and you repeat this tedious process for all overlapping photos that will be used in the panorama before setting the layers' opacities back to 100%. Needless to say, this is both time-consuming and highly prone to error, and the manually merged result only works if you shot the overlapping photos using a tripod with a panning head and a very level camera. By comparison, Canon's ""PhotoStitch"" program is very user-friendly and flexible with its options, and it automatically aligns and merges photos in the order that you specify.

 Performance, Stability, Reliability:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating

 Compared to previous versions of PSP, this X5 version has pretty good stability. During almost one year of weekly usage before writing this review, I have had the software crash or hang about 3 or 4 times total, and this includes running the software on an old underpowered Windows Vista laptop and a tiny Windows 7 Dell Mini 10 netbook. Corel has obviously worked on adding stability with this version, along with GPU optimizations.

 Speed has been noticeably improved, the performance is considerably faster than previous versions, start-up time to launch the program for the first time has been improved, and these improvements are especially apparent when running PSP X5 on an older slower computer. When used on my 5-year old Windows Vista laptop with 2GB memory, applying most effects happens in real-time, and for some operations such as adjusting sharpening parameters on 100-MB TIFF image files, the pop-up preview window will still display a progress meter, but these progress meters only last for a few seconds on this older laptop of mine.

 This X5 version uses less than 400 MB of disk space on a full install. The previous X4 version used about 900 MB of disk space, and version X3 required 3GB of disk space, which tells me that prior to X4, PSP had become very bloated and disorganized. So this redesign both increased performance and reduced the disk space required. By comparison, Adobe's Photoshop Elements 11 requires a whopping 3GB to 4GB of disk space, even though it has less features and effects than PSP.

 Competitive Pricing & Value:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating

 At the time of this review's writing, PaintShop Pro X5 Ultimate is being discounted on Amazon at a price less than $50, and its price is less than Amazon's price for Photoshop Elements 11, even though PSPX4 is a more capable and better program! With the Amazon discounting, this is truly a bargain for the amount of photo and graphics editing power that you get.

 Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:

For overall bang-for-the-buck combination of very affordable value and feature-packed power in a commercial photo-editing software package, this PSP X5 currently reigns supreme, beating out Adobe Photoshop Elements 11 and all other photo-editing software that I can think of. If you want something even less expensive, look into a freeware graphics software called ""GIMP"" which offers a ton of graphics editing power for free. And if you have no experience with graphics software or if you do not want to spend time learning its complexities, look into the free and easy-to-use software called ""Paint. NET"".

Despite the significant performance improvements in versions X4 and X5 (they are roughly 50% to 100% faster than X3 and also far more stable), it still does have its slow areas of laggardly performance. In particular, this is not a good software for processing RAW files, both due to its slow RAW converter and due to its limited RAW compatibility.

If you want the deluxe photo management and editing solution, deluxe in capability, cost, and complexity, using Adobe's Lightroom and Photoshop CS are the way to go. Otherwise, this PSP X5 is an excellent ""Photoshop for the masses"" alternative. If you primarily shoot in RAW, adding Corel's AfterShot Pro allows for great RAW handling followed by photo editing in PSP X5. And if Corel's HDR feature in PSP X5 has whetted your appetite for HDR processing, you should seriously consider getting Photomatix Pro (currently at version 4) since its capabilities exceed anything that Corel or Adobe has to offer.

If you are using a version of PaintShop Pro prior to X4, is this PSP X5 worth the upgrade?

Most definitely! There were many dozens of improvements in going from X3 to X4. Even if you ignore all of its new features and enhancements, just the fact that X4 and X5 run a lot faster and are more stable than X3 is a compelling enough reason to upgrade. However, the improvements in going from X4 to X5 are more incremental; there were far more improvements in going from X3 to X4. But with a good discounted price, it is still worthy upgrading from X4 to X5.

If you are just starting out with photo-editing, should you buy this PSP X5 or Adobe Photoshop Elements 11?

I feel that PSP X5 is a far more capable and feature-rich program than Adobe Photoshop Elements 11. PSP X5 is more like the full-blown Photoshop CS version than APE11. APE11 includes more built-in layer styles that PSP X5 does not have, although if you are just starting out, you will not miss this. Once you become proficient in PSP X5, you can create your own styles and record them as scripts to repeatedly reuse. Photoshop Elements has a much larger user base than PSP, and there are numerous sites to download brushes and textures from, but it is easy to convert Photoshop brushes to use in PSP, so that is not really a problem. APE11 has more adjustment brushes than PSP X5 when it comes to brushing on effects like dodge, burn, and saturation. But PSP X5 has more artistic tools than APE11, useful for painting, drawing, scrapbooking, and graphic design, and PSP X5 is more useful and flexible for manipulating images other than photos than APE11. PSP X5 requires less than one third the disk space to install than APE11, and at the time of this review's writing, Amazon has it priced lower than APE11, even though PSP X5 is far more packed with features. But... if you think that you will eventually migrate up to Photoshop CS, which is far more complex, powerful, and expensive, then starting out with APE11 will give you skills that are more transferable to Photoshop CS than becoming proficient with PSP X5.

One final note: On August 2013, Corel released a ""Service Pack 3"" patch that provides various enhancements and bug fixes. After installing PaintShop Pro X5 on your computer, you can either download this 98-MB executable from Corel's Web site, or from the user interface, click 'Help' and ""Check for Updates"" to download and install the service pack that way. You should definitely install this service pack .",5
"I started exploring the capabilities of of Autodesk's AutoCAD Revit LT even before the software landed on my doorstep.  That included talking to experts in the field, customer service, including tech.  I have the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AutoCAD-2013/dp/B007MF77R0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AutoCAD 2013</a>&nbsp;by Autodesk and my previous review/overview is directly below this one.  In the overview, I make mention to useful references and its numerous improvements over the 2012 issue. This should enable small businesses to decide what their company needs.  One of the questions I wanted to know about the AutoCAD Revit LT was what exactly was included in the subscription, something that no one at Autodesk seemed to know.  One benefit, that I found by default was the outstanding access to technical assistance.  I went online, got myself into a queue and received a call within minutes.

Back to the subscription plan before I head off into specs and feature of Autodesk's AutoCAD Revit LT 2013 in comparison to the AutoCAD LT 2013.  There are three levels of support that Autodesk offers via subscription:  Basic, Advanced, and Enterprise Priority.  The subscription included with the purchase of this particular version of AutoCAD Revit LT is the Basic.  If you wish to upgrade your level, you may do so by contacting Autodesk directly, purchase online, or through a local Autodesk reseller.  This was one seemingly simple question that took me several weeks to get answered.  As I mentioned before, the web and phone access to technical questions is prompt and excellent.

All software, regardless of subscription purchase or not, includes what is called Up-and-Ready.  It does include installation support, peripheral device setup, and configuration of product and system variables.  You will also receive phone and online resource support.  I'll outline the benefits of Basic, Advanced, and Enterprise Priority.  This will be a rather lengthy review and you can simply skip over the parts you are not interested in.  Just glancing at the benefits will definitely give you an idea as to the type of support and expertise you'll have at your fingertips with a subscription.

SUBSCRIPTION BENEFITS:

Enterprise Priority:

*  You will have access to around the clock telephone support for severity 1 issues.

*  You will be assigned a support account manager who will personally support requests, work through escalations, and oversee your account needs.

*  Proactive support services are customized to meet the individual needs of clients, ""including operational assessments and project health checks.""

*  You'll be able to interact with some of Autodesk's senior leaders and get a chance to meet them at Autodesk University and other company sponsored events.

*  If you'd like you'll be able to participate in and offer your input into beta projects.

*  You'll have an Autodesk Developer Network (ADN) professional membership with which you can have access to ""developer support and training.""

*  You will be able to have an unlimited number of ""named callers"" who can contact Autodesk support.

*  You will able to reach back in time and obtain resolution of severity 1 problems in ""previous releases.""

Enterprise Priority & Advanced:

*  Remote desktop assistance is available to help you troubleshoot and resolve problems that may arise.

*  Support for the application programming interface (API) is available.  You can contact ""Autoface Developer Support with technical issues related to application programming interfaces (API).  I found the ability to access this support is superb.

*  24 x 5 telephone support from Autodesk specialists (access depends on what time zone you are in).

*  You can ""escalate question"" on an online community support forum.  Immediate assistance is available.  It definitely is because I tried out this feature.  My question was not one that could be answered, but I was pointed in another direction with phone numbers.

*  You can access updated ""webcast training seminars,"" a must if you encounter problems.

Enterprise Priority, Advanced, and Basic:

*  Phone support from Autodesk during local business hours, once again dependent on your time zone.

*  If you try to access online community support and do not received a response within 24 hours, your request is escalated.

*  You have access to web support via community support forums and you can ""submit requests"" through the Subscription Center.

*  There is an online knowledge base ""containing a wealth of valuable information.""  For example, there are several online videos and tutorials.  Some are on the Autodesk site while others can be accessed through YouTube.

*  You have access to Up-and-Ready which includes installation support, peripheral device setup, and configuration of product and system variables.

I did receive a Comparison Matrix, something that you probably won't receive when you order Autodesk AutoCAD Revit LT 2013 or AutoCAD LT 2013.  This comparison really gives one an idea between the capabilities each has to offer, information a small business needs to know prior to investing in one or the other.  AutoCAD LT 2013 has only four of the features, two in documentation and two in collaboration.  I've decided replicate the Comparison Matrix (Copyright Autodesk, 2012) below, making note of the features AutoCAD LT 2013 has in parenthesis.

Autodesk Revit LT 2012 and AutoCAT LT 2013

Comparison Matrix

There have been numerous improvements to AutoCAD 2013, some very subtle such as a minor font size increase to major ones such as the ""Annotation Monitor"" and the addition of Cloud.  Some of the improvements are simply blips, but I've outlined what I can see so the individual users can decide for themselves whether or not they want to purchase or upgrade
AutoCAD 2013 is the 27th release, a technology that is used by a wide variety of occupations.  The learning curve can be steep and I'd highly recommend adding one or two books to your library.  I'd recommend selecting one or two of these:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AutoCAD-2013-and-AutoCAD-LT-2013-Bible/dp/1118328299/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AutoCAD 2013 and AutoCAD LT 2013 Bible</a>&nbsp;by Ellen Finkelstein,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mastering-AutoCAD-2013-and-AutoCAD-LT-2013/dp/1118174070/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mastering AutoCAD 2013 and AutoCAD LT 2013</a>&nbsp;by George Omura  and, if you are a novice,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AutoCAD-2013-For-Dummies/dp/1118281128/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AutoCAD 2013 For Dummies</a>&nbsp;by Bill Fane.

Changes are the same for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AutoCAD-LT-2013-for-Mac/dp/B007MF78HY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AutoCAD LT 2013 for Mac</a>.

"Microsoft Office is the standard among office suites for many of us, with Word being the principal program. It wasn't always this way, as those who have been computer users for some years will remember well. In fact, we may have all been running WordPerfect Office with its affiliated programs if it wasn't for some strange twists in computer history beginning in the 1990s.

There are a number of variants of this Office suite that can be found for sale here, but this review is specifically focused on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Office-Professional-2013-Key-Card-1PC-1User/dp/B009SPL2K0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Office Professional 2013 Key Card 1PC/1User</a>&nbsp;version. This version is activated from the Internet by entering a product key card, and is licensed for one user on one PC. It offers the current versions of Microsoft's Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, OneNote, Access, and Publisher applications.

Please note: I had previously installed the more basic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Office-Home-Business-2013-Key-Card-1PC-1User/dp/B009SPWJ98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Office Home & Business 2013 Key Card 1PC/1User</a>&nbsp;version on a Window 7 PC notebook, and that version had worked quite well. This Office Professional 2013 version was for installation on a PC that had been upgraded to Windows 8.1, so it was initially more of an experiment than anything. Here are the highly-subjective likes and dislikes found so far with this installation of the new Office Professional 2013 suite for those looking for just the key points, then followed with some expanded details.

 Likes:

+ Very smooth installation; simple directions, easy to follow, almost effortless
+ Clean interface; smooth and minimalist, ribbon can be collapsed as needed
+ Excellent Outlook integration; works well with Outlook.com, Gmail and private email
+ SkyDrive; allows for access of files on the cloud, file sharing when needed
+ Easy customization once installed; make it work your way

 Rants & Irritants:

- Full ALL CAPS menu tabs; don't like having the Metro-style jammed down my throat

 Installation:

The setup is simple and easy to follow. Included in the small box are the directions and a 25-character Product Key card. Go to the Microsoft Office site as indicated, enter the characters from the card as noted, then sign into or create your Microsoft account. Users who already have an Outlook account (possibly converted over from Hotmail) can start with that. Then it's a simple scenario of following the on-screen directions, and the entire installation should be finished in under 30 minutes.

Found the interface to be much cleaner than my older Office 2007 running on another older computer, and with the exception of the CAPS ON menu tabs noted above, it was a good improvement. Though I did not do any precise stopwatch timings, Office 365 seemed to load faster and smoother. The ribbon menu can be collapsed or expanded as needed. When you open up Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Publisher or the other components, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document, which is just an extra click away.

What follows are some subjective notes about the various components found within this Office suite. I won't attempt to go too heavy into each of these as one could write a full review on most of the modules by themselves, but consider these as observations found from a few weeks use.

 SkyDrive:

I like SkyDrive and have been using it for some time. This has been integrated quite well within Office Professional and the other Office 2013 variants, and it has built in resilience against jittery Internet connections. Should you should lose your connectivity while working on a file opened from a SkyDrive account, Office saves it temporarily on your local hard drive before synchronizing with SkyDrive at a later point in time. And what is good is that it syncs quite well so that you can retrieve/edit documents (or images) from other computers once you're logged in.

 Word:

The features for Word have remained largely the same as those in Office 2007 and those that I've found working on clients' Office 2010 installations. Documents often need to be edited after they are written, and Word 2013 makes the editing process easier with such new features such as the ability to edit PDF files. Previously, you needed to install third-party software, such as Adobe Acrobat. This was available to those of us who have been running Word for Mac 2011 where it does a respectable job, but is new to the PC version. Have not had much time to play with it, but if it works as well as the Mac version, then this will be a big help.

Among the new additions that I've found are that you can watch embedded videos right there within the document, and without having to go to a different application. If you work with collaborative documents, you can reply within comments and those replies will be displayed in threaded conversation style.

 Excel:

On a personal note, I have had a love/hate relationship with spreadsheet programs in general since the days of Microsoft Multiplan and Lotus 1-2-3, both of which are distant history now. That being said, Excel has been a program of choice for years now, and one that I've used to input table data into Word and as a flat file database for quite some time. Entering data into spreadsheets can be a tedious and boring chore, so the downward fill feature in Excel that allows you automatically fill the cells in each row with the same number by dragging down has been an ally.

But now there's a new Flash Fill feature that recognizes patterns in your data functions, then automatically fills in the rest of the spreadsheet, and complex formulas are not necessary. You can make it automatically format names the same way (such as last, first, middle initial) just by giving it some examples. Phone numbers can be converted to a uniform format, and restoring the leading zero to zip codes is a breeze. Look for the Flash Fill button on the Data tab and try it. It's well worth it.

 OneNote:

This is probably one of the most overlooked and underrated components of the Office suites. First encountered it in Office 2007, and it became a handy way to keep simple notes and such, but it was limited. The new version will allow you to embed Excel spreadsheets and see the preview within your note. When you update the spreadsheet, the preview automatically updates, as well. Searching within OneNote is better, as you can now search for words that are embedded in graphics files.

 PowerPoint:

There's a new, cleaner look to PowerPoint. You can start a new presentation using a theme, a template, an older presentation or a more recent one, as well as a blank one. New users should find PowerPoint 2013 to be more intuitive than older versions, and those who are experienced PowerPoint pros will find that everything seems to go smoother. I pulled up some old presentations, including one that was from the late 1990s, and found that doing a few edits was a very smooth process. The themes now come with variations, so tightening up on the look you want is simpler.

 Outlook:

There's an openness to this upgraded version. Outlook is a powerful module, but it will take new users a bit of time to learn to navigate among all of the functions and to understand the numerous toolbar icons, as I found out when showing mine to a colleague. I've been using Outlook under Office for Mac 2011 on a MacBook Pro, and never had an issue with Outlook on the OS X platform. I'm currently trying to sync the two versions as much as possible, and it seems to be working.

 Publisher:

I personally use Publisher infrequently at this point. Like the other modules in Office Professional, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document.

 Access:

The Office Access relational database management system was a product that at one time was a favorite when I was converting over from dBase III many years ago. Speaking honestly, I have only accessed this module a few times for conversion of some older files... and pardon the pun.

 Annoyances & Irritants:

My primary gripe with the new Office suites has to do with the full ALL CAPS menu tabs, and I'm trying my best to see if I can learn to adapt or if I'll change it. As noted earlier, I don't like the ""new"" Microsoft Metro style being jammed down my throat without the option to change it easily. It's essentially the same one that we find on the Office pages on the Web. There is a workaround, but it must be done in each individual Office 2013 module that you use: go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon, then use the Rename button on each one of the main menu items listed in the right pane under Customize the Ribbon. Instead of changing the name, however, add a space to the end of the name, and then click OK. When you return to the Home tab, the ribbon menu items will be displayed in a title case, with only the first letter capitalized. You can also go back to the ALL CAPS default by resetting them.

 Suggestions:

Putting this simply, if you're happy with Office 2007 or 2010, you may want to weigh your choices between the various versions here, read some of the reviews that best apply to your own needs, then decide whether you wish to keep the earlier version or go for the upgrade. This version was for installation on a PC that had recently been upgraded to Windows 8.1, and my installation went smoothly. It works well, though your results may differ from mine.

Please note: this review will be dynamic in that as I find experiences worth sharing, be they pro or con, they will be appended to this review. Other findings or additional resources may be listed in the comments, along with some links to resources that may prove to be helpful.

 Summary:

This&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Office-Professional-2013-Key-Card-1PC-1User/dp/B009SPL2K0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Office Professional 2013 Key Card 1PC/1User</a>&nbsp;version is for one PC, so be aware of this and check the specs before ordering.  One of the other Office suites may be better suited to your needs. Please keep in mind that with such a program, your needs and mine may differ, as we each use such office suites in different fashions. Currently I'll rate this suite at a solid 5-star product that can easily be recommended on the Windows 8 or 8.1 platforms.

" Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:
 Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!

I originally started using Corel's VideoStudio software beginning with version X2.  With this X6 version, Corel continues to add new features and useful enhancements, important bug fixes and crucial improvements to software stability, along with performance and speed boosts by taking advantage of Intel's and AMD's new CPUs and also GPU acceleration provided by specific Nvidia graphics processors.  One really cool performance feature offered by VideoStudio is that it has a ""Smart Proxy"" editing mode, where you can edit high-definition video in a low-resolution mode, thereby allowing you to use a slower computer without necessarily slowing down to a sluggish crawl.  These performance enhancements offer a huge advantage because many of us do not upgrade our computers frequently with the latest fastest CPU processors.  So some of the other brands of video editing software may be unbearably slow on these slower computers (even to the point of completely freezing up) while VideoStudio X6 can still zip along with a decent amount of responsiveness on slower computers.

Even though I do not like how Corel has organized the user interface layout for their PaintShop Pro X5 photo-editing software, I continue to like the changes and improvements that they have made to this VideoStudio X6.  I can resize, drag, dock, and undock various windows and UI elements to suit my workspace preferences and everything seems to behave intuitively.  But as with how Corel has designed their help system for PaintShop Pro X5 software, the one aspect of the VideoStudio X6 user interface that I really dislike is that to access the help menus, I am forced to hop through intermediate menus before it launches the online help from Corel's Web site using my browser.  With both PaintShop Pro X5 and VideoStudio X6, I now just bookmark the help information URLs and access them directly from my browser instead of clicking the cumbersome help button from within the application.  Even though the latest and most up-to-date online help information can be dynamically accessed directly from Corel's Web site when using this browser approach, I would still really prefer the previous approach of at least being given the option during the installation of the software to load the full help documentation on my computer's local hard drive since that also gives me the freedom to access the user manuals and help guides when I use the software without having Internet access.

I had fun using the time-lapse photography feature.  I used a Canon Timer Remote Controller TC-80N3 to shoot a series of timer-delayed photos of the sun setting behind the mountains and another cool every-two-minutes photo series that I made last summer of a morning glory vine slowly opening up its blooms, and then I used the VideoStudio X6's time-lapse photography feature to create a video from both of these photo series that look like a sped-up time-lapse movie.  If both videos had been recorded as real-time videos, they would have been mind-numbingly boring to watch, but when sped up using the time-lapse feature, they allow everyday people like me to showcase the wonders of nature just like how the professional movies and television nature programs use time-lapse photography.

The software lets me use both standard definition and HD videos, and editing, authoring, and burning of both video types is easy.  The software is very flexible in importing videos from your hard drive or capturing them directly from your video recorders.  There are flexible options for viewing your files in different ways such as timeline or storyboard modes, which are useful for adding videos, pictures, text, audio and music tracks.  You can also trim or split your video into sections for better continuity, adding transitions and enhancing with many kinds of built-in effects.  Once you upload your video, you can trim and divide the video into clips.  Trimming is marking the beginning and ending of an entire clip, while multi-trimming is useful to divide one segment into multiple clips.  Multi-trimming is very useful for editing out various parts of a recorded video to exclude sections that are boring or extraneous.  This software's trimming functions are powerful and very easy to use, allowing me to feel like a Hollywood film director while I edit my videos to make them flow seamlessly between different scenes.

As with previous versions of VideoStudio, you can import photos to create a photo slideshow along with adding text and music accompaniment.  The software is very flexible for adding music or audio voiceovers to your video projects from a variety of sources.  You can add audio to your projects in Corel VideoStudio X6 using various methods such as adding audio files to the library from your hard drive, ripping music from a CD, or recording a voiceover clip.  You can edit the audio clips using a built-in sound mixer to adjust the volume, length and duration, fade-in/fade-out, and apply various mixing and sound filter effects to the audio tracks.  The video editor does limit you to six overlay video tracks along with your main video track, combined with up to two title tracks, a voice track, and three music tracks.  While this is less than some video-editing software that lets you incorporate many dozens of tracks, it is more than sufficient for the vast majority of everyday users (like me) who mainly work with personal videos and it is sufficient even for editing important events like videos of weddings and vacations.

After you have finished editing your video masterpiece, you can export in a variety of common formats including FLV files for YouTube, MPG (MPEG-1/MPEG-2), AVCHD (including new AVCHD 2.0 support in X6), WMV HD, Windows Media, RealMedia, AVI, and QuickTime.  You also have the option to upload your work to Vimeo, Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube.  The software can create menus for DVD, Blu-ray, AVCHD, and it offers eight Blu-ray and twelve DVD menu choices.  This X6 version has pretty decent 3D video capabilities.  Even though I admit that I am a 3D video editing newbie, this feature seems limited and fairly rudimentary in its 3D rendering options, but it can create some pretty cool eye-popping 3D effects and is easy to use.  This will NOT get you the kind of 3D video that Hollywood can create, but it does add another dimension of ""eye candy Wow factor"" to your videos...  Just don't expect to create your own version of an ""Avatar 3D"" movie.  3D glasses are included with the software.

This is a big complex software application that really requires some patience for you to slowly become more familiar with all of its features and power.  But its user interface is cleanly designed so that newbie first-timers can start editing their videos with ease without fully mastering all of its powerful features.  Fortunately, Corel also provides plenty of online help along with easy-to-use templates and more than 60 really cool special effects and more than 150 transition effects to let you experiment and try out many of its flexible options so even video-editing newbies can create a polished slick video with ease.  The software uses a nondestructive editing approach so that your original video file is not being directly modified along the way.  This also allows you to experiment, even trying out wacky ideas and special effects, turning a tedious chore into a fun playtime of creating video eye candy.

Back when I was using VideoStudio X2, the software had various erratic and quirky bugs and serious stability issues; it can be disheartening to have the software freeze up after you have spent more than an hour editing a video.  Many of these problems have thankfully been resolved in this version X6; not once did I encounter a freeze-up or crash during my edits using X6.  When used on an older slower Windows Vista laptop of mine, the software can be sluggishly slow sometimes, but I prefer dealing with slower performance on a slower computer than having to deal with annoying software bugs and applications that freeze up or crash on me, so I accept the fact that I have to wait longer when using VideoStudio X6 on a slower laptop that is more than four years old.  As with any video editing software, especially when editing HD videos, your best experience will result from using a fast computer with lots of memory.  While this VideoStudio X6 lacks some of the features and has more track-editing limitations when compared to both CyberLink PowerDirector and Adobe Premiere, I think that it beats those two when it comes to multi-trim clip editing, key framing, and its best-in-class stop-motion and time-lapse animation capabilities.  And VideoStudio X6 is far easier and more intuitive to learn for a newbie compared to Adobe Premiere's dense complexity.  If this software was priced at $300, I would rate it 4 stars or maybe 3.5 stars, but with its inexpensive list price and Corel's frequent heavy pricing discounts, I rate it 5 stars because you really do get a lot of video editing bang for the buck here.  And if you are not technically adept, have some patience as you familiarize yourself with the software.",5
"I am usually very good at writing reviews, but this product has had me wondering how to begin.  There are so many amazing facets to this program that I am not quite sure how to go about addressing this.

There is a variety of ways that I can address this from the person who has never seen Painter before to the person who has used Painter since the days of its origin at Fractal Design before Corel bought it, and even those who use this for high end graphics production in text books, fine art, and gaming illustration.

I have decided to go about it from the perspective of what I am using it for and a brief history of my experiences and exposure to Painter.  I will also list what my computer is like, what I am using for a graphics device, and then as best I can what is new in the program.  I will submit this review and add to it as I can gather the information to provide for you.  This will not be short and sweet, because this program is very deep and intense.  I don't think you can justify a short review of it.

a fine artist.  My primary use for Painter at the time was to use it for throwing ideas up
into the screen and trying out alternative colors and textures for my paintings.

Sometimes I would scan in my paintings or take a photo if the painting was too big and use
the program to test out ideas.  I even would do this for using it for very tiny details- the kind
that could greatly ruin a painting should I put it in the wrong place.

I work in watercolor primarily so I need something like this to test out ideas as watercolor is something
you can not retract once you have done it.  That can be highly frustrating when you have worked a long
while on a painting and you ruin it by doing one small thing at the end.

Painter helps me to avoid this kind of frustration.  For this, it has been a delightful tool.

I used to have the ArtZII pen and graphics tablet, but due to some awful driver issues, it suddenly
stopped working with Windows XP.  That meant that the Painter X that I had purchased was pretty much
useless to me and I never got to explore the program.  I could not afford another pen and using a mouse
was far too frustrating.

The old Painter was nice.  It gave the idea of doing artwork on the computer, but there was still a gap
between real time artist tools and what was in the program.  Still it was useful and I used it constantly
until my Wacom graphics tablet stopped working.

EXPERIENCE OF PAINTER X3

Since it has been some years since I have had the chance to use Painter, I have forgotten all of the wonderful
things it can do.

I now have the Intuos 5 Touch Graphic Tablet (Medium) from Wacom and let me tell you this program is so overwhelming
I feel as if I might drown there is so much in it.

When you first enter the program, there is an opportunity to get some training on using Painter X3.
You can opt into the training from the initial screen.  This will give you an option to go to the extensive
help files or go online to learn how to use Painter X3 for whatever your penchant is.

There are tutorials for Fine Arts, Illustrating, Photo Art, and Painter Interface.  Beyond that, there are
tutorials for doing specific art pieces provided by a variety of artists.  Some are for previous versions of
Painter, but they still apply.

HOW THE PROGRAM INTERACTS WITH INTUOUS 5

I am a bit overwhelmed with this program.  Not only am I dealing with all of the amazing improvements of the program
since I used to use it constantly, but the Intuos 5 is another whole breed of graphics pads.  Painter is designed
to work with the Intuos 5 graphics tablet, so you can do just about anything with it.

I love that when I am working with the pad you can zoom in or out just by using your fingers to expand or contract
the paper.  This can be turned off, incidentally.  You can turn the paper to just about any angle you like with your
fingers as well so the art creation experience is much more realistic.

There is a seemingly endless series of brush strokes and nuances that this pen and tablet capture that are very close
to duplicating the real life art experience.  There is the ability to take a thick line and draw it down to almost imperceptible
line that fades to a point just like in real life.

The new jitter brush enhancement to this program is delightful.  It more closely duplicates the way that paint or other media will
not be uniform no matter how much you have a steady hand.

SOME NEW THINGS THAT IMPRESS ME

The Jitter brush is one of the new features, and there is a brush search.  You can search based upon what you want- if you want only brushes that will jitter, then you can narrow it down by that.  I have not had any problems with this feature yet, but as I continue to use it over time, I will update.

There is a way to view an inspirational reference image while you keep focus on your current work. You can independently change the view of the docked panel without changing your work space or changing focus from it.

You can also control the minimum values of brushes like size or opacity.  Also, you have some bit of control of the settings of the jitter brushes.  I have not had a huge amount of interaction with this to find the bugs yet, but it sure is interesting to mess with.

Perspective guides are amazing to me- they are lines that appear so you can use them as guides when putting perspective in your painting or work.

There is also an ability to go back and forth between a clone image- you can apply some changes to the original piece that you are cloning as well as the work you are cloning to- going back and forth between them.

I have not been able to truly explore the layer application but now you can apply changes to layers simultaneously.  The small projects I tested it on worked well- again I have not come across bugs yet.

FINAL COMMENTS

I have to say that this Painter X3 release is so packed full of goodies that I can not even begin to rave as much as I want to in this limited space.  Using it with the Intuos graphics pad makes it so delightful that I am like a kid in a candy store with unlimited budget!

There are some frustrations with the Intuos- using this sometimes is a bit frustrating- the paper will go a bit too far left or right, or become too small or big and I have to mess with it, but I am not sure if this is the software in Painter, the Intuos 5 physically, or a combination of both.

There is so much in this program that I want to comment on but I will update this review as I have the chance to explore it more in depth.  I am truly impressed with it so far.  I am not naive, however.  Programs will have bugs or limitations in them and it is just a matter of time before I encounter one.  However, at this time, it is pretty solid in performance and I love using it.

WHO WOULD LIKE THIS PROGRAM?

--If you are a graphic artist who tends to want to do more ornate graphics, backgrounds or illustrations, you would most likely like this program.

--If you are a fine artist who wants to test out designs before you paint them, you will definitely like this.

--If you are a photo person who likes to dress up photos in a more artistic way, you will like this.

--If you have access to a decent computer with the ability to get a graphics pad, you will probably like this, especially if it is the Wacom Intuos 5

WHO WOULD PROBABLY NOT LIKE THIS?

--If you have an older computer and graphics pad, you might not like this.  It takes some power to use. (Go bigger than minimum system requirements)

--If you are a dabbler, you will probably not like this program.  They do have a lighter version that might be better

--If you the type of person who has to feel the texture of the paper below your hand and experience the smells and performance of real media, you probably won't like this program.  Many of the artists I tried to talk into trying it, refuse for those reasons.

All in all, at this time, I highly recommend this program to any artist who loves the arts, anything that is geared toward working with natural media (pen and ink, spraying, painting, markers, watercolor, etc).  If you are delighted at being creative this program will give you more than you will probably ever use, but you will have a lot of freedom to create.

Again, I will update this review as I discover more about this delightfully overwhelming program.",5
"I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both TaxCut and TurboTax to compare. I found that TurboTax did not do anything better than TaxCut while costing consistently more.

 WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I purchased a digital download version of H&R Block Deluxe plus State. The Federal portion of these two packages is identical, so I am cross posting my review of the Federal portion of the software for both packages .

H&R Block Deluxe entitles you to 5 free federal e-files. You can print and mail as many returns as you want, there is no limit on printing.

 GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until January 9, 2014.

 H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. Last year I had to do both and I found the guidance in Deluxe package was sufficient to complete the forms.

 Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on ""learn more"" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

 H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

 DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC. You no longer need to enter this information on H&R web site. I prefer having this information locally on my PC for better security. The change from web site to local PC was introduced last year and I was happy to see that this change is here to stay.

 I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

 I use large font option on my monitor display and in the past years had display issues on some forms (text boxes were display overlapping each other on some forms). This year all forms displayed properly.

 I usually purchase tax software as early as possible to help me with end year tax planning. However, if timing is not important to you be aware that the price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter ""Amazon price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word camel in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached. During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

 At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

 Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

 Update: Several people asked me via comments if Schedule C is included in Deluxe edition because it is not explicitly mentioned in the description.  Schedule C form is included and covered in the interview.

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.

One state software is included in the package but the package does NOT include free e-file for the state return (see one exception below). If you want to e-file  your state return you will need to pay a fee of $19.95 to e-file each state return. Alternatively, you can print all the forms and mail them using US post office.  If you need to file taxes for an additional state, each additional state is $39.95 plus $19.95 e-file fee.  Ouch!

Note: NY state residents can e-file state returns for free.

I found that both programs satisfied my needs but H&R Block costs consistently less.  I have been buying the Deluxe version of H&R Block, before purchasing I check to see if my needs are covered by the feature set of Deluxe version. The main thing I check if the mutual funds sales and cost basis calculations are included (Schedule D) and the form for Foreign Tax Credit from mutual funds is present (Form 1116). H&R Block Deluxe version includes these forms but to get this functionality in TurboTax you need to buy the Premium version of the software.

 INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I had no problems with my install. However last year I helped a friend resolve an install problem on a Windows 8 PC.  I am including what we did in case this helps someone else. Normally the automatic install runs a file called ""tcauto.exe"". This file in turn calls another program located under ""installers"" directory which actually does the work.  We were able to by-pass the error by executing the exe program in the installers directory directly ""HRBlock_Deluxe+Efile+State_2014_CD.exe"" (it is the only file in that directory).

 If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes.

Alternatively, you can go to H&R website, hover (do not click) ""Download Software"" on the top banner and select ""State Editions"". Currently it says ""Please check back in mid January 2015"".

When the state forms became available and I clicked to start the download the entire program disappears for about a minute (I thought it crashed), but then the download screen appeared and the program continued normally.

 At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

 Sometimes I want to return to some section of my return.  The best way to jump to any section directly without navigating through other pages is to use ""take me to"" button which is displayed at the top of every page, on the same line as H&R Block banner.

 Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

 Problem alert 
There is a bug importing TT 2013 data when using XP.  There is a lengthy discussion on this topic in H&R support forum including a post from H&R Support that they are aware of the issue and working on it.
Amazon does not allow to post URL links in the text of the review, so I am posting a link to the discussion as a comment. Hopefully there will be an update when the problem is fixed.

 The final tax return can be saved in a .PDF format for future reference.

 Updated 2/25/15. You might have noticed that front page states that the next update is March 12, 2015. Someone asked me about this rather late update and I was able to find what portion of the return is effected by the update by searching the H&R support forum: This update is related to ""The Health Insurance Coverage"" with ""The Marketplace Health Insurance"" for participants that are 65 or older.

 What to do if my social security number was used by a thief?

During the last year there were many different data breaches and some people's social security numbers have been stolen.  It appears that some thieves filed returns using the stolen social security numbers.  If this happens the person who tries to file a return will get the following error:

IRS records show the spouse's Social Security number (SSN) on this return is the same as the primary taxpayer's SSN on another return already filed this year. Double-check your spouse's SSN. Fix any issues and e-file again. Otherwise, you'll have to file a paper return.

What to do if this happens?
1. Call HRB told them of the issue (1-800-472-5625)
2. Call IRS (1-800-829-1040) had them flag the SS#
IRS states that people need to mail completed return, a copy of police report or Form 14039 Identity Theft Affidavit http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14039.pdf, copy of Drivers License or passport or SS card.

3. Call Equifax and have them put an alert on the SS# (They notify Experian and TransUnion as well)
4. Call Social Security Administration and notify them (1-800-772-1213)

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.

"I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both H&R Block and TurboTax to compare. I found that both programs satisfied my needs but H&R Block costs consistently less. I have been buying the Deluxe version of H&R Block, before purchasing I check to see if my needs are covered by the feature set of Deluxe version. The main thing I check if the mutual funds sales and cost basis calculations are included (Schedule D) and the form for Foreign Tax Credit from mutual funds is present (Form 1116). H&R Block Deluxe version includes these forms but to get this functionality in TurboTax you need to buy the Premium version of the software.

 INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I had no problems with my install. However last year I helped a friend resolve an install problem on a Windows 8 PC. I am including what we did in case this helps someone else. Normally the automatic install runs a file called ""tcauto.exe"". This file in turn calls another program located under ""installers"" directory which actually does the work. We were able to by-pass the error my executing the exe program in the installers directory directly ""HRBlock_Deluxe+Efile+State_2014_CD.exe"" (it is the only file in that directory).

 If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

 If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you dowload it. The key-code can be located two ways.
Option 1: After my download finished the install started automatically offering me a choice of two links ""View Keys"" and ""Install"".
Option 2: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

 Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic ""Installing Software on Another Computer""
I quote the FAQ answer below:
""There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.
Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.
The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, ""Can I install the software on a second computer?""
Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.""

 WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This H&R Block Deluxe includes only the federal tax return (no State).  This version entitles a person to 5 free federal e-files.  The program allows to print any number of returns without limits, and if you decide to mail returns (instead of e-filing) there no additional fees.

 GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until mid January of 2015.

 Pet Peeve: H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. Last year I had to do both and I found the guidance in Deluxe package was sufficient to complete the forms.

 Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on ""learn more"" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

 H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

 DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC. You no longer need to enter this information on H&R web site. I prefer having this information locally on my PC for better security. It suggests reasonable prices based on condition of the donated item and it is nice not to have to come with what is reasonable on my own.

 Pet Peeve: I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

 I usually purchase tax software as early as possible to help me with end year tax planning. However, if timing is not important to you be aware that the price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter ""Amazon price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word camel in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached. During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

 At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

 Sometimes I want to return to some section of my return. The best way to jump to any section directly without navigating through other pages is to use ""take me to"" button which is displayed at the top of every page, on the same line as H&R Block banner.

 Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

 Problem alert 
There is a bug importing TT 2013 data when using XP.  There is a lengthy discussion on this topic in H&R support forum including a post from H&R Support that they aware of the issue and working on it.
Amazon does not allow to post URL links in the text of the review, so I am posting a link to the discussion as a comment.

 Adding this point based on a useful question in the comments:  The final tax return can be saved in a .PDF format for future reference.

 Updated 2/25/15. You might have noticed that front page states that the next update is March 12, 2015. Someone asked me about this rather late update and I was able to find what portion of the return is effected by the update by searching the H&R support forum: This update is related to ""The Health Insurance Coverage"" with ""The Marketplace Health Insurance"" for participants that are 65 or older.

 What to do if my social security number was used by a thief?

During the last year there were many different data breaches and some people's social security numbers have been stolen.  It appears that some thieves filed returns using the stolen social security numbers.  If this happens the person who tries to file a return will get the following error:

IRS records show the spouse's Social Security number (SSN) on this return is the same as the primary taxpayer's SSN on another return already filed this year. Double-check your spouse's SSN. Fix any issues and e-file again. Otherwise, you'll have to file a paper return.

What to do if this happens?
1. Call HRB told them of the issue (1-800-472-5625)
2. Call IRS (1-800-829-1040) had them flag the SS#
IRS states that people need to mail completed return, a copy of police report or Form 14039 Identity Theft Affidavit http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14039.pdf, copy of Drivers License or passport or SS card.

3. Call Equifax and have them put an alert on the SS# (They notify Experian and TransUnion as well)
4. Call Social Security Administration and notify them (1-800-772-1213)
5. File with FTC https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/Information#crnt&panel1-1
6. File a police report of a possible identity theft

 WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I purchased H&R Block Deluxe plus State. This version entitles me to 5 free federal e-files. It allows me to print and mail as many returns as I want, there is no limit on printing.

One state software is included in the package but the package does NOT include free e-file for the state return (see one exception below). If you want to e-file your state return you will need to pay a fee of $19.95 to e-file each state return. Alternatively, you can print all the forms and mail them using US post office without any additional fees. If you need to file taxes for an additional state, each additional state is $39.95 plus $19.95 e-file fee.

Note: NY state residents can e-file state returns for free.

 For folks trying to download State Forms. The state forms are not available as of 11/30/2014. You have an option of entering email where you will be notified as soon as the form for your state becomes available. Alternatively, you can go to H&R website, hover (do not click) ""Download Software"" on the top banner and select ""State Editions"". Currently it says ""Please check back in mid January 2015"".

When the state forms became available and I clicked to start the download the entire program disappears for about a minute (I thought it crashed), but then the download screen appeared and the program continued normally.

 At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check).

I am including what we did again as I know a few people told me in helped with 2014 install. Normally the automatic install runs a file called ""tcauto.exe"". This file in turn calls another program located under ""installers"" directory which actually does the work. We were able to by-pass the error by executing the exe program in the installers directory directly, this year it should be called ""HR_Block_Tax_Software_2015_Deluxe__State_-_Windows_CD.exe"" (it is the only file in that directory).

' If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

' If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you dowload it. The key-code can be located several ways.
Option 1:  In the past when my download finished the install started automatically and offered me a choice of two links ""View Keys"" and ""Install"".
Option 2:  This year the install did not start automatically so I clicked on the install program myself, and on the first screen it asked for ""Activation code"".  When I purchased the software Amazon sent me a message which included a Product Code (note that they did not call it Activation code) which is the number I needed.
Option 3: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

' If you have a virus scanner it will generate an alert the first time you run the program, change the permission to ""Permin Always"" otherwise the program will be blocked.

' Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic ""Installing Software on Another Computer""
I quote the FAQ answer below:
""There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.

' WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I purchased H&R Block Deluxe plus State. This version entitles me to 5 free federal e-files. It allows me to print and mail as many returns as I want, there is no limit on printed returns.

One state software is included in the package but the package does NOT include free e-file for the state return (see one exception below). If you want to e-file your state return you will need to pay a fee of $19.95 to e-file each state return. Alternatively, you can print all the forms and mail them using US post office without any additional fees. If you need to file taxes for an additional state, each additional state is $39.95 plus $19.95 e-file fee.

Note 1: NY state residents can e-file state returns for free if their income is $60,000 or less.
Note 2: It is not possible to e-file a state return for New Hampshire, it has to be mailed in.

' GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until mid January of 2016.

' Pet Peeve: H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations.

' Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on ""learn more"" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

' H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

' DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC.  It suggests reasonable prices based on condition of the donated item and it is nice not to have to come up with what is reasonable on my own.

' Pet Peeve: I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

' For folks trying to download State Forms. The state forms are not available as of 11/20/2015. H&R web site says they will become available in January.  To see the latest status you can go to H&R website, click on Dowload software, then hover over  ""Download Software"" on the top banner and select ""State Editions"". Currently it says ""Coming soon in January 2016"".

When the state forms became available and  teh state software can be downloaded directly from the program.

' At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

' Sometimes I want to return to some section of my return. The best way to jump to any section directly without navigating through other pages is to use ""take me to"" button which is displayed at the top of every page, on the same line as H&R Block banner.

' Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

' The final tax return can be saved in a .PDF format for future reference.

'  In 2014 TurboTax's introduced a requirement that the data had to be sent to Intuit's servers to be formatted for printing. I verified that H&R Block can print forms when Ethernet connection is disconnected.

'  If you owe taxes there are three options for payment: electronic withdrawal from your bank, mailing a check and paying by credit card from a secure web site. Is there a charge to pay by credit card? Yes. There are three web sites that do this service and the fees vary from the lowest of $2.50 flat fee for a debit card to highest of 2.25% fee by credit card from one of the web sites.  If you search for ""pay taxes by credit or debit"" you will see the detailed fee schedule on the irs.gov web site.

' IDENTIFY THEFT AND TAX RETURNS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
'  Last year there were many reports of thieves filing fraudulent tax returns using stolen social security numbers
If this happens the person who tries to file their own  tax return gets the following error:

IRS records show the spouse's Social Security number (SSN) on this return is the same as the primary taxpayer's SSN on another return already filed this year. Double-check your spouse's SSN. Fix any issues and e-file again. Otherwise, you'll have to file a paper return.

What to do if this happens?
1. Call HRB told them of the issue (1-800-472-5625)
2. Call IRS (1-800-829-1040) had them flag the SS#
IRS states that people need to mail completed return, a copy of police report or Form 14039 Identity Theft Affidavit (...) copy of Drivers License or passport or SS card.
3. Call Equifax and have them put an alert on the SS# (They notify Experian and TransUnion as well)
4. Call Social Security Administration and notify them (1-800-772-1213)
5. File with FTC (...)
6. File a police report of a possible identity theft

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.

Ali Julia review",5
"Two years ago, I upgraded to PowerDVD 14 Ultra. Because PowerDVD 14 Ultra did not support FLAC audio, I still often used the VLC media player to play content that has FLAC audio. And to play ISO images on disk, I use Daemon Tools to mount ISO files to virtual drives that both PowerDVD 14 and VLC could then play. The free VLC media player also starts up a lot quicker than PowerDVD if I just wanted to quickly view something. Support for FLAC audio and the ability to play ISO images were both added to PowerDVD 15, along with a PowerDVD Remote app that lets you use your iPhone or iPod Touch as a remote control. PowerDVD 16 Ultra's two main improvements to PowerDVD 15 Ultra are: (1) a new ""TV Mode"", which I do not find that much more useful than the usual ""PC Mode"", and (2) some YouTube features such as the ability to download YouTube videos to play offline and the ability to upscale YouTube videos to HD quality, and the ability to watch Vimeo videos.

I was initially excited about the new YouTube features that were introduced in this version 16.  However, the new YouTube options are VERY buggy :-( In trying to play various YouTube videos in PowerDVD 16 Ultra, the software would either tell me that the video cannot be played and it just provided a link for me to play the video using the Web browser, or the PowerDVD busy-icon would continue to spin forever until I clicked the [Stop] button to end the attempt at playing the YouTube video and I had to use the Web browser to view that video on the YouTube site.  But for the online videos that PowerDVD is able to play, I am then able to use its TrueTheater audio and video enhancement options.  I often turn off the TrueTheater function when playing Blu-ray discs.  But YouTube videos often have mediocre video or audio quality, and so I find the TrueTheater enhancements to be very useful for playing online videos.

With many YouTube videos, PowerDVD only offers a subset of resolution qualities.  For example, I often encountered YouTube videos where PowerDVD only gave me the option to play it at two or three resolutions, such as 360P or 720P quality.  But if I play the same video using my Web browser on the YouTube site, I get the full spectrum of 144P, 240P, 360P, 480P, 720P, and 1080P quality options.  I would not mind PowerDVD leaving out some of the lower resolutions, but it should at least offer to play the video at the highest resolution that YouTube offers.  But instead it sometimes would not include the 1080P and/or 720P options that YouTube offers for the video, whereas playing the same video from the Web browser gives me all of those quality options.

The new feature to ""download YouTube videos to play offline"" is partially useful.  The software downloads the YouTube video to its own cache directory in a proprietary format.  So if you were hoping that PowerDVD 16 Ultra can now download YouTube videos as portable AVI or MP4 video files, it does not do this.  There are various Web sites that let you perform online conversion and download of AVI or MP4 files from YouTube, Vimeo, and other video sources.

In order to play ISO images, PowerDVD 16 first needs to install a device driver that creates a virtual drive.  On two ISO images, I found a weird bug where the video would play, but the audio was entirely missing.  But if I mount these same two ISO files using Daemon Tools Lite and then play the ISO image on the virtual drive that Daemon Tools Lite created, PowerDVD 16 then plays the audio normally.  So if you are not getting any audio from an ISO image being played by PowerDVD 16, try mounting the ISO file using Daemon Tools first, and then using PowerDVD 16 to play the ISO image mounted on the Daemon Tools' virtual drive, instead of directly playing the ISO image using PowerDVD 16.  If you plan to frequently play various ISO images during a single viewing session, it is faster to use Daemon Tools to mount the ISO images.  PowerDVD 16 takes awhile to mount each ISO image before it can play the ISO file.  You see its busy-icon spinning on the screen while it creates a virtual drive to mount the ISO image.  When you click the [Stop] button, the ISO image is unmounted and the virtual drive is removed.  And then when you play a different ISO file, you have to wait again while it creates a new virtual drive.  This delay is okay if you are just playing one ISO file.  But if you want to play multiple ISO files in a quick sequence, it is quicker to start up Daemon Tools and use it to mount each ISO file before playing the files in PowerDVD by accessing the virtual drives created by Daemon Tools.  I think PowerDVD's handling of ISO images would have fewer delays if it did not remove its virtual drive after the playback of each ISO image is stopped.  Ideally, after the first ISO image is played, the PowerDVD virtual drive should be retained for further use with other ISO files and only removed when PowerDVD is exited.

PowerDVD 16 is advertised for use with Windows 7, 8/8.1, and 10.  But I have also been using it on Windows Vista (Service Pack 2) for several weeks now with no problems.  It seems more stable than the previous PowerDVD 14 Ultra that I was using.  PowerDVD 14 Ultra would sometimes crash my computer with the Windows ""Blue Screen Of Death"", but I have not yet experienced a BSOD crash using PowerDVD Ultra 16.

Compared with PowerDVD 14, this version 16 is also far more well-behaved and polished in all areas.  After I installed PowerDVD 14 Ultra two years ago, I discovered that its installation routine quietly changed every file type association to default to PowerDVD, including all video, music, and image file types.  Other software like WinRAR and VLC Media Player politely ask if you want to associate various file types to default to being used by their software, and they let you click or unclick the file types that you want to associate or dissociate with the program.  Now PowerDVD 16's installation process also lets you select which file types to associate with the software, instead of forcing itself onto every file type.  PowerDVD 16 also has subtle improvements in remembering where you last played a video and the folder that you accessed last.

With my previous PowerDVD 14 version, every time that I closed the program, it would always still leave between one and five different processes running in the background that serve no purpose other than to consume memory.  With this PowerDVD 16 Ultra, closing the program usually cleanly ends five of the processes used by the program: clmediaparsersb.exe, CLMPSvc.exe, PowerDVD.exe, PowerDVD16Agent.exe, and PowerDVDMovie.exe.  It does sometimes leave the clmediaparsersb.exe, CLMPSvc.exe, or PowerDVD.exe processes still running, which I then manually have to end in Task Manager.  But this happens far less than how the previous version 14 would often leave these programs still running.  Most users will not notice or care about these leftover processes still lingering after the program is closed, but I frequently run CPU-intensive and memory-intensive programs, so I like to minimize the number of unnecessary processes.

As was also the case with PowerDVD Ultra 14, I have not noticed any strict licensing restrictions as I have been able to install PowerDVD 16 Ultra on multiple computers running Windows Vista, 7, 8.1, and 10.

If you are satisfied with the PowerDVD 15 Ultra that you previously installed, unless you can get a great upgrade price, the improvements in going from version 15 to 16 are far less than the improvements in going from version 14 to 15.

And if you are satisfied with using the free VLC media player, this PowerDVD 16 Ultra is quite expensive to get the extra features that you may not need or care about, and PowerDVD consumes a lot more memory than VLC. To me, one of the main convenience features of this PowerDVD version is the ability to directly play ISO images without the need of additional software to mount the ISO image.  But you can use the free version of Daemon Tools Lite to mount ISO images and play them with VLC too. On some slow computers, I have sometimes found VLC to stutter, lag, and drop frames during playback of some video content, whereas PowerDVD appears to utilize much better internal buffering to smooth out the playback and I rarely get dropped frames on PowerDVD.  But for unknown reasons, there are also various videos in MKV and AVI formats that play more smoothly on VLC than on PowerDVD. So for me at least, I like keeping both the latest VLC version 2.2.4 and this PowerDVD 16 Ultra on my Home Theater PC, because neither of these two media players can still play everything with equal smoothness.  But PowerDVD 16 Ultra now plays just about any kind of DVD and Blu-ray format that I throw at it.

So my 5-star rating is based on upgrading my previous PowerDVD 14 Ultra to this version 16.  If I was already using PowerDVD 15 Ultra, I would probably rate this 4 stars for upgrading from version 15 Ultra to 16 Ultra because this version 16 is not as much of an improvement from version 15.  But if you have version 14 or earlier, this version 16 is worth the upgrade.",5

I take photos of special events, outdoor landscapes, pets, flowers and architecture, peppering in some product photos from time to time. I take most photos with my Nikon D3300 camera, but like so many of us, I also take a lot of photos on the fly with my iPhone too. Ive used Corels photo editing software in addition to Picasa, various photo editing apps on my iPad, and have used Adobe Lightroom 4 and currently enjoy using Adobes Photoshop Elements 13.

I wasn't sure Id need this software. Its not like Photoshop in that its not really about tweaking individual photos as much as batch editing (Lightroom does it, but it can be tough to understand how to do it) and adding a watermarks to a bunch of photos (a batch) at one time.

This software is for photographers who want to take their photos and make similar adjustments to groups of photos, instead of working with each one individually.  You can always do more later, but this software makes editing RAW photos (if you don't know what that means, you're probably not doing it)  and organizing them in a professional way, much easier.

------------------------------------------

SETUP

The first thing I did was go to the link given to me to download the software.

The download took only a second or two, then I was prompted to either go with the trial version (30 days FREE - you can go to the Corel site and try it out before you buy)  or add my serial number.

I added the serial number and the installation took off, running only about 3 minutes to completion.

When finished I was taken to a page on the Corel site with a 11 minute tutorial video. Theres actually 6 video tutorials for this product and you can view them on the AfterShot Pro YouTube channel.

Tutorial videos include:

1. How to copy and paste image settings in AfterShot Pro

2. How to adjust white balance and color correction in AfterShot Pro

3. How to adjust tone and exposure with AfterShot Pro

4. Quick tips for adjusting and processing RAW files with AfterShot Pro

5. Getting Started with AfterShot Pro for a Faster Workflow

6. Get More with AfterShot Pro 3: more cameras, more presets, more plugins

Also on the page with the tutorial video are links to Web-Based Help, User Guide, FAQs, Corel User to User Forum, Discovery Center, and Points of View Blog.

The link to the User Guide did take me to a User Guide for AfterShot Pro 2 - not 3 - but maybe they are so much alike they didn't need a new User Guide?  Why buy 3 then?!  Not sure about that one.  Truthfully I did find the User Guide for 3 on the download page (PDF) - so its there just not everywhere!

--------------------------------------------------

SOFTWARE FEATURES: ITS ALL ABOUT THE WORKFLOW

Its pretty good stuff and after the tutorials and a bit of practice, its remarkably easy to use. Feels very familiar - similar to Lightroom and I installed it on a Windows 7 PC with a Core i7 processor and 16GB of ram. It ran flawlessly through its tasks, despite the older operating system.

This software will also install on MAC computers, Windows 10, Windows 8 and Linux systems.

In the open software (to the left) you have access to the photos you want to browse via your PCs file structure.  It makes this workflow software very similar to Lightroom.  You can, but you don't have to, import everything into a catalog.

You can bookmark file folders to automatically have it open when you use the software again. This is a very cool feature! There are also lots of ways to sort your images and label them to increase productivity. Color coding (by star rating) is one of these and its easy to do.

One thing I noticed was the large number of preset plugins that can be added to the software to further add to its functionality. Most are free, a few are twenty bucks or so, but all really add powerful batch editing to the basic framework of the software. (When the software is open, its on the far right vertical tab where it says Get More next to a red star.)

You can tweak photos individually, or use presets. You can also make your own presets or use the auto-levels.  Perfectly Clear works very well for a good starting point to fine tuning.  You can also create adjustment layers, which means you can play with backgrounds or foregrounds to create even better photos. Heal/Clone layer also allows for fixing imperfections.

History views allow the user to see how youve changed your photo.  You can save your changes to create a preset for other photos.  This is a little bit confusing, but with practice users who have also used similar software from Adobe (Lightroom and Photoshop) this will be easier.
This software isn't the easiest to use for novices to photo editing software, but its got a lot of great features for those looking for a budget-friendly alternative to Adobe Lightroom.  I like how Corel attempts to educate users on the features through their tutorials, but its only with time and practice that I feel like Ill become proficient using it.

--------------------------------------------------------

PLUG-INS MAKE IT COOL

Im excited about the plug-ins which can be directly downloaded within the software (so many are for free). The 32-bit ones may or may not work with this software, but since they are 3rd party offerings you might give 'em a go and if you don't like them remove them.  Most are free, but a few cost around twenty dollars each.

--------------------------------------------------

This software is 64-bit; quick and I noticed no lag or drag on my system when using it. If its what you need - its a solid buy.

I really like this solid performing software, however I think it might be unnecessary for those who already have other similar software. Viewing metadata, working with RAW files, adding layers, adding a watermark, presets... all very cool features, however for those who don't need that info or aren't sure, they may want to give it a try to see if it's for them.

I suggest downloading the FREE trial first before purchasing to see if its for you. I think this is the best way to find out if it has the features and functionality you are looking for in the shortest amount of time. If you find it frustrating to use in the trial version - even viewing the tutorials and looking at the User Guide, then you'll not be out any money.  If it's just what you wanted, then you can easily purchase it and add your serial number to make it your own.

"I love this brand because the ingredients are all good enough to eat, its Paraben free and best of all, no animal testing. I first found it online by doing a search for things with pumpkin in it, and now I'm on my 4th bottle of this and I also recommend the body lotion and face creams, I am slowly becoming totally enamored with this brand and always look forward to trying more things.

This wash beats soap anytime in the shower; the orange gelee collapses on itself when poured and feels cool and refreshing especially in the morning. I love the scent, its very delicate, smell like soft fruit scented air, nothing aggressive and doesn't feel too organic and strange but fancy enough. There is ginko biloba and cucumber water, green tea, chamomile, orange and of course carrots, silky aloe, cleansing Dead Sea water and even spirulina extract, which I have drank before but never used in products. It feels very light and my skin always feels clean but light, never dry and uncomfortable. The bottle is also large and lasts a while, which is nice.

As I get older it becomes more important to me to use as little chemicals as possible, of course in today&iexcl;s world we are bombarded with them and its hard since they appear in everything but still, ever little thing counts. Parabens for example are used as preservatives and are generally considered safe because of low levels of toxicity, but lately I keep reading how traces are found in cancer lumps especially in women and simply knowing that a cosmetic doesn't have it makes me happy. And I love my cosmetics almost as much as books, the bathroom is always stacked : )

"HEY!! I am an Aqua Velva Man and absolutely love this stuff, been using it for over 50 years. This is a true after shave lotion classic. Not quite sure how many women that have been attracted to me because of Aqua Velva,  I do know for sure that it's just to many to count. Ha.  Not sure how long this has been around but the Williams Company ran a paper advertisement, taken from a 1949 magazine, which features Ralph Bellamy of Detective Story and Ezio Pinza of South Pacific for Aqua Velva After Shave Lotion. I'm sure you all remember Ralph Bellamy and Ezio Pinza from the 40's right.

There slogan was "" There is nothing like an AQUA VELVA MAN "" and it seemed to work because this was a hot item when I was a young man. It's just amazing that this is still around when the vast majority of after shave lotions from that time period have disappeared over the years.

The only negative about Aqua Velva is it does not last very long. Usually in less than an hour the aroma has dissipated. The more expensive after shave lotions and perfumes have Ambergris in them which is quite expensive and comes from a sperm whale this enables the aroma to linger much longer.

At any rate this is a great classic after shave with a wonderful refreshing odor, give it a try you might just like it.

Note :::; Some reviewers mention this 7oz size now comes in a plastic container, I just bought one in Wal-Mart and it was glass.",5
"I used to wonder what caused redness and skin irritation every time I shaved. When it started for me I tried switching to environmentally friendly shaving cream, then I changed my shaving blades, then I tried changing my aftershave, but nothing helped. Regardless of what I did the irritation always came back.

I think I finally found the answer after I started using the new Philips Norelco drive-shave system. First, let me sing a praise for its smooth design and ingenious way of reminding me when I need to clean the blades (a cool blue image of a water faucet appears on the handle immediately after each shave) and how many minutes of battery life remain (cool blue large numbers appear after every shave as a reminder). As far as I am concerned these are the two main things I need to know so that I can get the job done.  Next, let share with you how wonderful I feel after each shave. The benefits of dry shaving prevented my skin from being exposed to the sharp blades and water, which in my opinion are solely responsible for the irritation of my skin.

If I could recommend one minor improvement, it would be to make the system's blades sensitive enough to be able to remove even the smallest or toughest hairs on my neck. I find myself having to reapply some circulating effort around the same areas every time until I get all the hairs out of the way. Still, this is a small price to pay considering the fact that I am pain and embracement free after each shave. A great gift idea.",5
"I'll give it five stars because it seems to do what it does well.  If you are concerned about the bacteria in your toothbrush and dipping it in alcohol isn't the answer for you then this product has your name written all over it.

I have a Sonicare toothbrush so for me the head of the toothbrush fit inside without a problem.  If you have another model then there are adapters you can put on it so that you can clean any other toothbrush.  But since I don't use them, I can't comment on how well they work.

The cleaning itself is pretty easy.  Just put it in, make sure the brushes are pointed the right way, close the lid, and hit the power button.  Ten minutes later it is done and all those big, bad bacteria are dead... well, 99% of them anyways.

So, there you have it, it works and it is easy to make it work.  What more could you ask for?

As a note, I do want to comment on what another reviewer wrote.  Namely, that people have survived decades without a device like this.  And I'd have to agree.  That is why I mentioned in the title that this may be perfect for hypochondriacs while most people will shrug and wonder what the point is.  For me, it is more of an OCD where I like to be thorough on the things I do.  Therefore, when I give my brush a thorough cleaning (monthly or so) then I like to finish it off inside of this product.  It's all a mental game and if this product makes you feel better/safer then it is worth every penny.",5
"This is just divine. I love every single I Coloniali product I ever tried. I find their mango shaving soap and rhubarb shaving cream to be very close or even on par with Acqua di Parma, which for me is the best shaving cream in existence, not just in terms of performance but also the scent and packaging, I love the rhubarb after shave balm but this hibiscus shaving cream, I believe it has no equal and I've tried a number of high-end shower products. The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life. Taking the morning shower with this baby is the perfect way to start the day.",5
"Having given up on bar soap and its innate ability to dry my skin out, I have been using shower gel for years.  Until recently, I've had no preference to any brand, as I felt they were all pretty similar.  After seeing some of the awards that Pattern Body Wash has received in various men's magazines I decided to try it for myself.

On opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemical-smelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  It has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  In addition to nutmeg, I have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  I was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  Many of the other brands that I have tried seem to over-foam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  This is not the case with any of the Pattern products I have tried.  The body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.

One of the other areas, in which I compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  Pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.

The price point is certainly several dollars more than I would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies I have tried over the past 20 years.

Great job Pattern on a fantastic product, you have made a routine shower a much better experience.",5
"I was finally convinced to start flossing regularly when a dentist told me I was showing the early signs of gingivitis.  That probably happened something like 15 years ago.  This is not the cheapest floss out there, but it really is the only one I can stand to use.  I just hate the waxy feeling of standard dental floss, but Glide is so much smoother.  (I am reminded of this every now and then when I run out of Glide and have to use free floss samples from the dentist until I can run to the store to restock.)

I started using Glide floss when I got braces (had them from age 25-28!).  I got tired of shredding floss on all the little wires, brackets, etc., and then trying to have to get it unstuck.  Glide wasn't 100% shred proof, but it outperformed any other floss I tried, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone with dental work to maneuver around (I had a wire glued to the back of my bottom teeth after my braces were removed, so I am stuck with a minor amount of dental work for life).

Unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn't even notice the change from original Glide (GoreTex) to the current product.  Well, I noticed the package was different, I suppose, but I felt like the product was still quite good.  I find it to be quite strong and not easily breakable (have even used it to sew up holes in dog toys).",5
"My daughter is thrilled with this flat iron.  She's been asking for a ceramic flat iron for a while now and I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try this.  She is pleased with how it flattens out her hair.

"I got this in a beauty subscription box.  I've had it for so long I forget which box.  I needed a new exfoliator so I grabbed this from my stash.

Here are the ingredients, since listing them provides a good introduction to the product:

Water, Lactic Acid, Polyethylene, Soybean Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Pectin, Papaya Fruit, Lactobacillus Pumpkin Ferment Extract, Ceteareth-20, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dehydroxanthan Gum, PEG-100 Stearate, Salicylic Acid, SD Alcohol 40-B, Bergamot Fruit Oil, Sorbic Acid, Cinnamomum Cassia Leaf Oil, Honey, Acetic Acid, Lavender Oil, Potassium Sorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate, Bromelain, Papain, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Phenoxyethanol, Geranium Maculatum Oil, Rosewood Wood Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Orange Oil, Linalool, Limonene, Cinnamal, Beta-Carotene (CI 75130), Chlorophyllin-Copper Complex (CI 75810).

This is basically a chemical and physical exfoliator in one.  It has lactic acid, papaya fruit, pumpkin extract, bromelain (digestive enzyme from pineapple), and papain (digestive enzyme from papaya).  I have seen all of these in peels before.  These ingredients are why you leave this on the face for one or two minutes after scrubbing with this product -- to give the ""peel"" portion time to do its work.

It also has some kind of grit in it.  I'm not sure what the grit is, but it works as a physical exfoliator.

This has a couple of other things that will especially help oily or acne-prone skin: salicylic acid, honey (has antibacterial properties), and retinyl palmitate (vitamin A).  Because of all the peeling ingredients and such, you will really want to use a good SPF product while you are using this to avoid sun damage.

This may make your skin more sensitive than usual.  I am a longtime exfoliator on a daily or every other day basis, so while I do get some tingling when I use this (usually every other day since this is a bit stronger than the sorts of things I normally use), it doesn't last -- once I wash the product off, the sensation goes away.  If you have sensitive skin, you will want to be super careful.  Maybe do a patch test first.  I think the tingling might be from the cinnamon; I have definitely had reactions to cinnamon oil in the past that turned my skin red, although it seems to be at a low enough level here that it is not doing that.

This is a green color, I'm guessing from the chlorophyll/copper complex.  It has the texture of a clay mask, maybe a bit thinner (easier to spread around on the face and rub in), and I can't quite place the smell, although this does have a lot of plant oils and extracts and I guess the scent is just a combination of those.  Maybe something citrusy but there are also some floral notes in there.

I personally don't find this drying.  I think the concentration of the grit/solids/beads is just about right as I can actually feel them moving over my face (some exfoliators don't have enough exfoliating particles to be worth it, but this is not one of those).  It washes off cleanly and has not caused any irritation to my skin.  I do think I am getting good results -- existing breakouts are clearing up faster than usual (this is really the only change in my routine) and I'm not getting new ones, even though I am using facial oils.  (I can only use facial oils if I am also using a good exfoliator.)

I do use kind of a lot of this at once.  I could probably get by with less and actually need to learn to get by with less because this is a pretty expensive product.  But, it works and I am going to dig through my stash (which is huge) to see if I can find more, because I am really liking the results.",5
"I have good skin, and I try just about every skin treatment product to keep it that way. A friend suggested I give Kate Someville's ExfoliKate a try...I was just a little astonished at the price! Even the samples aren't cheap on ebay (cheaper than on Amazon for the .25 ounce sampler size if you want to give this a whirl before you make a heavy investment.)

Now I can see why! This has to be the fastest and most potent skin care product I've ever tried.

The product comes out as a pretty malachite green, with a nice, fresh smell. You massage it onto clean, wet skin, and the directions said to let it sit for up to two minutes. It feels a little warm, but not unduly so; there are those little microbeads so many skin treatments have nowadays.

My skin is hardy, so I let it stay on my skin for five minutes before I rinsed it off.

Wow...just wow! My skin looks phenomenal, and it feels as smooth as a baby's bottom.

I was weighing buying a Clarisonic, but after this treatment, I can't see how my skin could better! I'm going to invest in the big tube - I can see ExfoliKate has earned a permanent place on my beauty treatment shelf.

Listen to what people are telling you; this really is THAT good.",5
"I bought this based largely on the features and the reviews on Amazon. The hand held WP-450 model has a 2-year warranty, but I've never had the batteries last for two years. Some don't make it to 18 months. The one I bought a year ago now only lasts for about 4 or 5 sessions before the charge dies. I recharge them for over 24 yours when they get week, which is what Waterpik recommends. So I have two so I can use one while the other one charges. Got tired of all this and got this plug in model and I wish I had done this several years ago. Being tethered to the hose is not a problem at all, the hand unit is much lighter and more maneuverable than the battery model, lighter too. I use this on #7 setting on the dial and it is just about the same as my old 450 units with a fresh charge. The highest setting is really powerful! Control easy to use, uses the same tips as my old units. I floss first, lightly brush with a tooth brush, then use a Sonicare. After this routing my hygienist still found food under my gums during a routing cleaning! That is when I added the Waterpik to my routine and they never found food after that again. Amazing to see what flossing and brushing with a Sonicare leaves behind. I am 67 and my gums have receded, so I need the extra flushing power of a water flosser. Dental floss does not get down between the gum and base of the tooth. I recommend this for anyone who is either starting out with your first water flosser or using a rechargable unit that you don't want to replace every 18 months because the battery is failing. Extra tips store in the lid to the tank. Tank easy to remove for cleaning. Can even be washed in the dishwasher if you remove the rubber valve/plug unit. I love the design, tube coils up and stores in the side of the unit with the handle slipping in a holder, all tucked out of the way. My teeth feel super clean even 12  hours after using this wonderful machine. Well made with quality materials.",5
"When i was 16 my dentist told me to buy a Waterpik as an alternative to flossing which I didn't like then or now. Many years have past and I have shot through quite a few Waterpik models and this is the current one I own. It is a little more evolved than its predecessors, but it still performs in pretty much the same way it always has. You fill the reservoir with water, attach the head to the handle which has a control to turn the water stream on and off, and then turn the device on to produce a spray of water as you move the head around to remove debris from between your teeth and gums. I think of the Waterpik as a power washer for the teeth and gums because it forces out pressurized water to irrigate those areas.
This model has a varying speed control to increase the water pressure to whatever is comfortable and effective for the individual user. It also comes with six different tips. While I use the flossing tip, there are tips for brace wearers, people who have crowns,etc, a tongue cleaner, and a couple of other tips for specific functions.
Other than eliminating the need to floss, the Waterpik has been beneficial to me. My teeth are always clean, I don't have gum disease, plaque, dental decay, etc.
The Waterpik is easy to use and maintain and has  paid for itself many times over since I never buy floss.",5
"While this Waterpik is not a total alternative for traditional flossing, it sure does help a ton if you have braces! It saves sooo much time and effort. Honestly, if I use this and then use regular floss string afterward, I never have anything come out on the string. I love this Waterpik! My teeth feel so clean after using it.

It is easy to use. You just fill the basin with water, pick your setting with the dial, and turn it on. It is a little messy - water run off - but it is worth it! I use it on the highest setting with no discomfort or pain at all. The different heads are all very useful and store right in the lid of the basin. It flips open and there is a compartmnt to keep them all. The coiled cord stays neatly in place in the holster when not in use.

I use a basin full of water, then refill with half water/half mouthwash and my mouth and teeth feel so clean and so smooth. It feels like I just left the dentist. It is also easy to clean from behind the teeth as well.

This is definitely one of the best investments I have made. I definitely recommend this wether you have braces or not. My kids even like using it. I bought extra heads for it so they each have their own and can just pop it on when they use the Waterpik.",5
"I've always prided myself on my good teeth. I thought that flossing and brushing was enough...that was until I went to the dentist, and he said I had the beginnings of periodontal disease. That scared the hell out of me.

I went home and started using the Sonicare I had bought but never plugged in. That was good, but not enough - I bought a Waterpik because obviously flossing wasn't cutting it.

I had never used a Waterpik before, and it was some revelation! I'm still amazed that there are some Waterpik oldtimers who say this machine isn't strong enough...uh, for what? Peeling paint off a brick wall? This thing absolutely knocked my socks off when it came to the PRESSURE.

I started out at 2 and worked my way up to 7 - it still stings like mad, but I'm getting used to it by now. I put Listerine in the tank to increase the anti-bacteria result.

My dentist went on vacation, and I had to cancel another appointment, so it happened that almost two months had elapsed since the last time I had seen him. In that time, I faithfully brushed with the Sonicare four times a day and used the Waterpik at least once (several tankfuls of water and Listerine worth.)

Regarding the leaking people talk about - the only time the tank leaks, I notice, is if I put my fingers on the seal when I'm refilling it. If I'm careful to keep my fingers away from that seal, the tank is water tight.

So when I returned for my check-up, the dentist was AMAZED. He wasn't sure what I had done, but he said my gums looked pink and healthy! He had said initially I'd have to get my teeth cleaned every three months because I must be one of those people who gets a tartar build up quicker than other people...well, I had worked religiously on scaling back the plaque. (I had also bought a dental mirror so I could check the back of my front teeth for telltale plaque residue.)

Hmmm, no comment about that plaque...was it because there WASN'T any? My dentist asked me if I had been eating because there was so little build up (I had to tear that out of him because I KNEW he didn't want to give me credit for working that hard on my dental hygiene!)

The dentist HADN'T recommended a Waterpik, but I knew I had to go to the extreme to beat back the periodontal enemy. My teeth are so clean, they squeak!",5
"This is an outstanding product!  I was a bit hesitant to order it given some of the reviews, but when it was discounted on a Friday Sale, I figured I'd give it a shot. SO glad I did!

To get the most out of the unit you have to read the manual. It clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir (why you would want to anyway is beyond me - why would anyone want to use stale water?). If you don't leave water in it, it won't leak out on your counter. Pretty simple equation there.

I agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless. They don't fit into the holder anyway, so just toss them out. Sure, try it, but I'll bet you'll find it to be basically useless compared with a true tongue cleaner (i.e., a scraper type device).

The water reservoir could be a bit bigger - an additional 20% bigger would be nice. But, it's very easy to fill even when the unit is running (keep a glass of water handy and just pour it in when the water level is at the half-way point). Simple and easy, and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact.

Sound level is very low compared with past WaterPik units. No, it's not silent, but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush or a shaver.  In fact, it is less noise than my shaver.

The auto-retractable hose is a very nice touch and keeps everything neat. Again, a couple inches longer would be nice, but there's the compact size trade-off again.

In actual performance - wow!  You will never believe that your teeth could get this clean! Wonderful feeling. There is a wide range of power adjustments ranging from very gentle to ouch! I've found setting the dial to the 5/6 range gives a good cleaning without any discomfort.

Good performance at a good price -- can't ask for more than that.",5
"The Crest + Oral-Professional Gingivitis Kit has an electric toothbrush plus timer and case, toothpaste, floss, and mouthwash in a disposable tote bag. There is a selection of four brush heads included, and I like the spinning head the best.  I have been using an Oral-B 1000 model for a few weeks so can compare it to this high-end 5000 model.

The charging base is nice, with no wall wart or metal contacts. At least when new, the battery will last for more than week of twice- or thrice-daily brushings. There are several brushing modes, including one for sensitive teeth and a mode with longer brushing times.  The sensitive mode is noticeably gentler.

This model will alert when a 30 or 45 second brushing time per quadrant has finished, by pulsing and with the little radio timer.  I don't really like the timer feature but it would be very helpful to teach a child how to brush; the visual reinforcement is effective.

The brush tips change easily but don't come off under use and they have colored rings to identify brush heads for multiple users. The handle is just the right size and has soft-touch plastic so it is comfortable and easy to grip. It really is waterproof because I have been using it in the shower with no problems. I would hesitate to actually immerse the bottom of the handle, though.

It is necessary to use a soft touch with these brushes; it is not pressure but the movement of the bristles that disturbs the plaque. Be especially careful if you have gum recession or crowns.  Fortunately, this model warns about using too much pressure.  I find this helpful.

There is an accessory that fits over the charging base to hold extra toothbrush heads which some may find useful as well as a carrying case.  I probably wouldn't bother with the weight and bulk when traveling and will continue to carry a manual toothbrush.

No complaints at all with this toothbrush except that the handle shows water and toothpaste residue and the heads are rather costly compared to a manual toothbrush. I do think it's worth the expense, though, for the ease in brushing, although the less-expensive models have the same basic features. An electric toothbrush would be especially helpful for anyone with arthritis in the hands.",5
"Overall, this is an amazing value and an awesome kit. The toothbrush is just wonderful and comes with plenty of heads for different cleaning/issues.. The mouthwash is a smaller sized bottle, but plenty to see if you like it and if it works well for you. Toothpaste and floss are full sized. This is a mouth transformation kit. If you have gum issues, or just want to take better care of your gums, this is the kit for you.

Previously I was using Sonicare Diamondclean and I was in love with it. Once I tried this Oral B toothbrush, I gave up on my Sonicare. I am 37, I smoke cigarettes, drink A LOT of energy drinks, and have braces. I NEED extra gum care and this toothbrush along with the mouthwash and toothpaste give me that. I would say that the toothbrush alone has made a big difference from when I was using the Sonicare.

I love that I can actually feel it working on my gums. It really feels like a gum massage. The smaller part of the head that moves separately is an awesome addition. That is where I feel the extra attention and the gum care. My teeth feel SO CLEAN after brushing with this one. I like that it is a more vigorous cleaning than with the Sonicare. It actually took me a long time to get used to the gentle cleaning that Sonicare toothbrushes give. I had been using Sonicare for about 10 years, so eventually I got used to it, although I never really did feel like they were really scrubbing as much as I liked. My teeth felt clean, but there was just something missing. This Oral B fills in the gap and gives me everything I am looking for, and then some. I just feel like my whole mouth is clean and fresh after using the Oral B.

The mouthwash is great for gums. I put some in my Waterpik (half mouthwash/half water) and I can tell a difference in the health and appearance of my gums. I do not get sore spots anymore and the sensitive areas are gone. Because of my braces, I tend to get gaps between my teeth down at the gumline. Debris get in there from eating and it can be painful and stay sore for a while. This mouthwash in the Waterpik really helps with all of the irritation.

The toothpaste is pretty good, although I think I will stick to my regular whitening toothpaste. I like a bit more bold mint flavor and I do need the whitening benefits due to cigarette smoking. Otherwise, it seems like a good toothpaste. It is a smoother mint flavor and seems to have almost a soothing effect on sore areas of the gum and mouth, so that is a plus when needed.

Mainly, I am just super impressed with the toothbrush. I had also tried the Oral B 7000 (black) but I much prefer this 5000 version. The 7000 was very impressive and the first Oral B to really make me switch from Sonicare, but just too loud. The 5000 here in this bundle just provides a better experience overall, without all of the noise. I thought the 7000 would end up being better, but it is not. It is sleek looking in black, but I just prefer the 5000 - I mean I really LOVE IT. The attention to the gums and the way it cleans so thoroughly and literally reaches every surface of the tooth, (even all around my braces!!!) is just amazing.

If you are going to invest in a good toothbrush, this is THE ONE to buy. if you need the extra gum care and attention this is the kit to buy. You can buy the toothbrush separate if you do not want all of the extra products, but for the price, you might as well get the bundle and try out the mouthwash, toothpaste and floss and see how you like them.

I do not intend to go back to Sonicare after having used this Oral B. I NEVER thought I would say that.",5
"If my dentist offered this kit at a good price I's snap it up in a heartbeat! Or if it was a 'get all this other stuff free when you buy the toothbrush' kind of thing. It's all you need for a healthy mouth in a re-usable little tote. And if you happen to be a dentist looking at this, there is cute little 'luggage tag' attached to it that has a sleeve for your business card. In six months when your client is using the tote for groceries, they just might look at that tag and remember to make an appointment!

Now lets look at what's inside.
First, there is one of those toothbrushes that syncs with a fun little device that tells you how you're brushing. GREAT for kids, but really nice for adults, too. It will even tell you if you are brushing too hard or soft. I love it! It does everything but reach in your mouth and brush FOR you.
The included toothpaste is slightly runny for a stand-up tube, but tastes fresh.
Next there is the Crest mouthwash. They claim it doesn't sting, and they're right. The mint lasts just long enough, with some others it spoils your taste buds for hours.
Finally, some dental floss. I prefer flossing picks but it certainly completes the package.

This is a terrific promo item or gift!",5
"Over the last 52 years I have made demands on my body and backed it up with miracle products. I want my tummy flat and my hair poofy, somehow my body got confused - with opposite results, so I have flat, yet still frizzy, hair. In the meantime I'm at that ""I need a haircut"" stage where I'm not sure what I want to do with it, so it's sort of half grown out, not long enough for headbands or to hold back, not short enough to really be a style, just unmanageable.

I decided what the heck and tried some Toni&guy plumping whip to see if I could whip it back into shape. The whip is a semi solid, sort of like coconut oil texture when it gets cool. The scent is very light and doesn't really smell of anything, no floral or perfume smell. The directions say to use a walnut size scoop, but since my hair is short I used about half that. Towel dry, scoop, put on hair, run through, dry. Easy enough, the whip didn't feel heavy on my fingers or hair, it rubbed through easily and I got out my blow dryer and went to work.

The crown and top of my hair plumped right up, and styled easily. I blew it flat by the ears so it wouldn't stick out and that worked too, so if you're doing a convoluted have lift half flat style this will work just fine. There is no residue feeling when I run my hand through my hair, and the volume probably increased by a good half.

I'm very pleased with the Tono&Guy (Liked the shampoo too, but that's another review) and my plump hair, now if my tummy would just get the memo I'd be set.",5
"To starts, I am so glad I checked the reviews here for the experience of others. Like a lot of others, I put this in my hair and left it, like one would do with a leave in product. And that was actually okay for my hair, since it's not that I have fine hair, but that I've cut it from being long and thick, to a shorter and thick hair style. A style that needs a lot of body and not be weighed down by heavy products, or else I don't get the desired effect.

But that's not how this product is designed to work. It's supposed to be washed out in the shower. This works very well for making hair soft but light and fluffy. And it really worked well for my teen daughter, who has very fine thin hair. Normally she can't use any conditioner in her hair. She's at an age where her hair is getting very oily every single day, and already having very fine thin hair, the two are a bad combination. So she has to use clarifying shampoo every day, and no conditioner, just to keep her hair nice.

This conditioner however is so light and washes away well in the shower, that she can use it to help soften her hair without completely weighing it down and adding to her oily hair issues. It also has a very nice citrus cent to it. This is so nice I may just keep buying this for her, as it's definitely made for her hair type more than my own.",5
"I have this in ""Berry Seductive"" but I've had a great experience with it and would certainly purchase it in other colors.

As you can see from the product image, this comes with two products -- a lip stain and a balm -- in one container.  I have found that I only needed to apply the lip stain (or liquid lipstick, or whatever you want to call it) once and it lasted throughout an entire work day.  So they're not lying about the 16 hours (well, I probably wore it for more like 10 or 11 hours, but it still looked good and was a bit difficult to remove at the end of that time).  I applied it using the doefoot applicator it comes with and then kept my lips slightly open while I let it dry.

I gave it a few minutes and did other things to get ready, then applied the balm over it.  The balm has a similar applicator to the lip stain part.  The balm (or you might call it a gloss) is clear.  It did pick up some of the color of the stain on the applicator when I used it, but no big deal since I'm only going to ever use the balm *with* the stain.  Anyway, although the stain itself was rather drying, using the second step made this product completely comfortable to wear.  I did have to reapply the balm a few times throughout the day.

I did not get much color transfer to mugs and I did not lose much color over the course of the day.  I found the appearance of the product quite acceptable at the end of the day.  It was actually a bit difficult to get off; I used a dual phase liquid makeup remover on a cotton pad and I kind of had to scrub.  You may want to finish up with a lip scrub to ensure complete removal.  Anyway, this stuff has staying power.

The berry color I had was more of a cool red than a true berry color, at least on my lips.  I really liked the color.  I'm pale, but I think it would show up on people with darker skin tones as well.  This was non-irritating and didn't have a noticeable fragrance.

Overall, I'm very happy with this product.  Definitely glad I bought it.",5
"If you love the scent of Patchouli plants and oils, you will love this soap!  This is a huge bar of soap.  It measures 4 inches wide and is 2.5 inches high and over an inch thick.  It is a light cocoa color with engravings on both sides of the bar.  The soap comes wrapped in plastic, but the aroma is unmistakably Patchouli.

To me, the scent the Patchouli reminds me of ""Dead Heads,"" or followers of the band Grateful Dead.  They made Patchouli oil main stream.  But Patchouli is also good to fight itchy skin, and smells wonderful. It has an unmistakable musky floral aroma.

This soap is also Shea Butter enriched, which means luxurious softness.  Nothing I've found blends into my skin like Shea Butter, and I have been religiously using Pre de Provence lotions with Shea Butter for a while now.  Their products are high quality and make me feel pampered.  The scents are delicious - I am feeding my soul with these wonderful fragrances.

While women will love this Patchouli Shea Butter Enriched soap, it will also be great for a man.  Patchouli is quite masculine.

This bar of soap is great for putting in your bathtub.  Or keep a bar at the sink to lather up and smell good between showers.  It makes a great gift - an addition to a gift basket for men or women.  Heaven probably smells a little like Patchouli and the scent is captured in this bar of soap.  It's fantastic.",5
"This is an average-sized bar of scented French-milled, French-made soap designed to over a more luxurious experience than consumer-grade soaps. I will be comparing this both in use and in price to average body bars, but my rating takes into the account that this is a premium product which offers certain benefits that you cannot get from products like basic Ivory soap or Kirkland's body bar. This gets extra points for those added qualities.

I will note the price differences first. This is a 150-gram bar for a little under $5 whereas a 130-gram bar of Kirkland signature will cost you an average of 66 cents. Both bars will get you equally clean, but that is really the only point where the products overlap. Besides the truly lovely rose scent of this bar (it smells like a real rose  mild and not too overbearing, but present), it has a much better feel. The lather is creamier and feels silkier on the skin. One point about it that I was really happy about was that it wasn't so perfumey that I walked out of the shower smelling as if I'd applied a scent to my skin. This was more of an enjoyable transient experience in which I enjoyed the scent while I was using it, but didn't subject others to it once I was out of the bath. In my case, my husband is super sensitive to perfume-like smells so this worked for me. If you're looking for something longer lasting, this may not be what you're after.

In terms of how it leaves my skin, this is absolutely better for not drying my skin out. I'm guessing that this is the shea butter replenishing to some extent what oils the soap is stripping off when you use the soap. I wouldn't say that you don't need an added moisturizer after using it (at least I still needed moisturizer), but it's definitely gentler than other bars that I've used.

The bar is very hard or solid in a way that consumer-grade bars are not. This is because of the quad-milling that is advertised on the product page. I had not heard about this process before trying this soap, but it reduces the water content of the bars and makes them last longer. I will note that my average bar of soap will tend to melt in the shower and there are little stalactites of soap residue on my soap dish on my shower caddy where the soap has dissolved and the residue has drained off and hardened (which represents a loss of soap/value). This soap doesn't do that. It dries harder and firmer and doesn't melt away at the edges. That means that it lasts a lot longer. I can't do a scientific test or anything, but my best guess is that I got 3x the mileage out of this bar than the Kirkland bars that I usually use (and possibly 4x the use compared to Ivory, which I find melts away much more rapidly than any other soap). This is still a more expensive soap on average than consumer-grade brands, but it isn't quite as expensive as it seems when you factor in longevity and the quality of experience is rather markedly better in terms of the feel and the scent.",5
"French milled soap and glycerine soaps are a weakness of mine, especially is they are pretty and smell great. This is a great moisturizing formula.

My skin visually appears more moisturized when I use this  soap (compared to the brand that was previously in my shower). I still required lotion but could have skipped it without feeling dry and itchy.

 Linden smells like an ultra-mild lily-of-the-valley fragrance.  Peony smells... like a peony (assumption as I've never sniffed one before). I don't like the way that Angel's Trumpet smells.  It doesn't impact my rating... this just isn't the fragrance for me. I don't dislike it enough to let it go to waste so this isn't a deal breaker.

When using this soap the fragrance is stronger in the air than on my skin. It creates a relaxing experience without leaving the skin heavily perfumed.

The color of the soap is a bright green-yellow. More yellow. Peony is a soft blush/shell pink. Angel Trumpet is a yellow-beige that my kids describe as r sandy-yellow. There is a marbled like consistency to this barbiturates am overall smooth feel.  The bars have a 12/2019 expiration date on them.a

The soap does not get water-logged and squishy and that is a great indicator that the bar will last more than a week.

This formula is skin-friendly and I like that the fragrance is not overpowering. I can't wait to try other fragrances!",5

"Pre de Provence does an exceptional job of combining fragrant essential oils and a wide array of plant oils to create the most enticing and luxurious body-pampering products that I've ever experienced.  I've been a fan for years.  Pre de Provence has greatly expanded their line over the past few years, and more and more of them are showing up on Amazon.  To have such wonderful French products available here at the touch of my computer screen is a real treat!
This line of soaps with Shea butter is especially comforting and gratifying.  I tried the lavender fragrance in this line and it is very fragrant.  It is floral and spicy and not cloyingly sweet.  It is a sophisticated fragrance, and it is potent and true lavender.  Just lovely!

The shea butter in this bar seems to make the lather glide smoothly across my skin.  It washes off well, yet seems to leave a softness behind that clings to my skin.  The little brownish pieces in the bar are actually pieces of petal.  I does not add any coarseness to the bar, and I think it may be included just to add to the ""artisanal"" look.  But maybe it works to hold essential oil, too.
The fragrance lasts only for an hour or two, and that is as it should be, I think.  It does not interfere with the perfume I wear.  The lavender fragrance is mostly restricted to the bath.",5
"Note: At the time of this review, seven different products are being sold on the same page. I am reviewing the lavendar lavender blossoms.

This is a generous amount of dried (loose) lavender blossoms designed to act in the same fashion as potpourri. The most important aspect to this product is the scent which I found to be delicate and natural. Lavender in general can be fairly overbearing, and you can smell this through the packet as it is relatively potent. However, it is not cloying or suffocating in its potency. I'm guessing this is because it's not as concentrated as a perfume or extract.

When you have the bag open and are exposed to all of it at once, it seems really strong, but as something you place in a location in lesser quantities, it doesn't tend to be so overbearing. I think that it strikes a good balance between being potent enough to have an effect and not being so potent as to make you queasy from a strong scent. I have had a lavender-scented face mask (the sort filled with beans that you heat or cool and apply to your face) for some time and found that putting that mask in a plastic zipper bag with a sachet made from these dried blossoms helped revived the fading scent quite well without have to risk staining the mask or making it smell too strong from using oils or perfume.

If there is any weak point to this, it is the presentation which can be a bit messy. I had to be very careful when opening the package not to spill the small, dried bits. It would have been better if it had come in a resealable package or a jar of some sort given how tiny they are. I decanted mine into a jar both to keep the scent contained in the long run and to more easily manage them. Still, since this point is intrinsic to the type of product this is (tiny dried blossoms), I'm not dinging it for that, but just noting it.",5
"Rock The Runway: Beautiful Red Color, does not disappoint!

I love Essie nail polish, I have a nice size collection of the regular polish. I also love gel nail polish - I have my own tools (LED light).

Standard nail polish never lasts more than 24 hours on my fingernail no matter what I do. Therefore I was excited to try the 2 step polish that requires no LED light but resembles Gel Polish and a hopes for a 14 day wear.

I did two test runs:

Test 1:
Did no nail prep -I just followed directions, two coats of color, one coat of top.  Dries quickly, leaves great gloss

Day 1: Looks great
Day 2: Very small chipping to start on dominate hand
Day 3: Removed: Chipping on 85% of nails

Test 2:
I removed all the polish and prep my nails this time just as I would with doing real GELs. (Push back cuticle, buff nail to remove shine, cleans, add dehydrator, two coats color, one coat of top.

Day 1-2: Looks great, the shine lasted
Day 3: Chipping starting on dominate hand
Day 4: Removed

Granted, I did get a longer wear out of this polish than I have my typical Essie nail polish (or any brand for that matter).  I just have a naturally oil nail bed, but doing some of the prep-work I was able to get one more extra day of the polish.  So this is defiantly an improvement!

Beautiful color!!!",5
"Rock the Runway is a simple, all purpose classic, pure bright but not overly-bright red. A Crayola red. A sharp choice for Christmas, Fourth of July, or even Valentine's Day. Creamy, opaque, quick drying and long wearing.  Just a great one.

All Essie's are great.  I wear them almost exclusively as they are almost the only thing that wears above a day on my crazy nails.  I can typically get about a week with any Essie (and I can go beyond that with their gel couture).  I do reapply top coat every 2nd or third day.

The Gel Couture polishes are a thicker more gelly like formula than the ""regular"" Essies.  They I also have a wider brush, but it's so nicely tapered that it's easy to work with.  I would recommend the ""Regular"" Essies if you want to do nail art, but for regular one-color wear, either formula is nice.  The Gel Couture line does wear a little longer, but I'm typically ready to change colors before I reach their maximum wear time.

One of my favorite aspects of Essie is that its very forgiving if you happen to be prone to messing up your nails.  They dry quickly once the top coat is on (the color is a little more vulnerable to marring before the  top coat is applied), and as they dry they self-level to give you a smooth glassy surface even if your technique (like mine) is imperfect.

The Gel Couture line really requires the matching top coat to get its wear time, but I use that top coat over other Essies quite often as well.

My Essie collection is approaching 100 bottles and my obsession shows no signs of abating.  I did receive this bottle free to review, however I routinely purchase these polishes with my own money.  This is one of several reds I own, and it's one of my favorites.",5
"I **LOVE** my Essies.  They are by far my favorite nail polish brand (and one of only two brands I will buy--only others are impossible on my nails).  Even though I have less-than-stellar technique and I am admittedly horribly hard on my nails, with Essie I can keep my nails looking professionally manicured without chips, redos, or drama. I am loyal to this brand for a reason!

WEAR TIME:  I'm fairly new to the Gel Couture line, though I've worn the classic Essie polishes for much longer.  I wondered how these would compare to my regular Essie routing (which is, Grow Stronger base coat, 2 coats of color, followed by Good to Go top coat), and I was astounded to find they compare very, very favorably.  I swear by Essie base coat, but was impressed that Gel Couture performed equally well with and without it.  (I do still like using it for a treatment layer and to prevent nail discoloration overtime; with Gel Couture I noticed no difference in wear time with or without base coat, though base coat  is a game changer with the classic Essies).  With my classic Essie colors, I tend to get about a week of wear, but do reapply top coat intermittently during the week (my goal is always every other day, but I usually forget pretty often).  In testing these out, I resisted reapplying top coat AT ALL, so that I could get a sense of how they wore on one application.  I'm quite impressed.  I got 11 days of wear, with a small few chips coming of the 11th or 12th day (depending on the shade).  I'm more than satisfied with that, given that I'm ridiculously hard on my nails and don't own a dishwasher.  Also, aside from Essie, I've found (at any price point) that there's only one other brand that doesn't chip within 24 hours (I can usually get 4 or 5 days with Revlon, so it's my second choice).  I went from a week with ""regular"" Essie to almost TWO weeks with these.  These last well past the point where I want to change my polish colors.

COLOR APPLICATION:  I've tried 7 of these Gala Bolds (as well as some from the original release and all but two of the Ballet Nudes), and I would say that with the exception of ONE shade, all of these polishes are dreamy to work with.  These are slightly thicker, more jelly like consistency than the classic Essies.  They are smooth and self leveling, apply like butter and look as smooth as satin.  The drip-free brush has a fabulous contour, so even working on my small nails, the wider brush was not an issue.  Most shades were opaque in one coat (but I'm a two coat girl, so I went for two anyway).  As Essie herself says, they ""Go on like silk and wear like Iron.""  The one color with a less stellar experience was ""Wearing Hue"" and if you sort Amazon reviews by color (yup, that's possible) you'll notice that most of the few negative reviews relate to that shade.  It's not an impossible shade, and milky opaque pastel colors are the more ""struggle-some"" colors in any range.  However, I did need a third coat to get to opaque and needed be more careful about not overflowing the nail bed. It still self leveled and wore beautifully.  I'd give this one shade 4 stars, but the others deserve more than 5.

(And anytime you are working with Essie, be patient with your perceived mistakes; give them a moment, they will self level and look as smooth as a calm sea even if you thought your application wasn't perfect.  They may be magic.)

TOP COAT:  I've taken to using this top coat with regular Essies instead of my Good to Go top coat.  There's magic in this bottle. Instead of getting 6-7 days with classic Essies, I can get more (though, I rarely want to, as I like to change my nail colors.)  With this top coat on Gel Couture, I am seeing 11 days!  Also, though I reapplied the Good to Go throughout the week, I don't feel the need to reapply with this one.  The Good to Go MIGHT stay a little (tiny bit) shinier through the week, but that's a hard call.  Though both wear well, this is my favorite.  Both dry super fast.  Like, ridiculously fast.  (I am currently testing the Gel Setter one, so I can't compare it yet.)  You do need to use this top coat with the Gel Couture polishes (or they won't last), however it's nice that it will work with traditional Essies as well.

I called Essie about this Platinum Gel Couture Top Coat, since I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be an improvement on the Gel Couture Top Coat (which is what it was called in the initial release of this line).  Essie has FABULOUS customer service, and they were able to confirm that it was a rebranding, and Gel Couture Top Coat and Platinum Gel Couture Top Coat are the same thing, just slightly rebranded.  (Not to be confused with the Gel Setter top coat, which IS different, and is NOT the one to use with this line.)

I can never recommend Essie enough.  They changed my nail game.  When I was almost ready to give up because fixing my nails took soooo long to do and to dry and I was getting so frustrated with fixing my mistakes, I discovered Essie.  They are MAGIC, I tell you.  They dry to a pro finish in spite of weak skills, and before I have a chance to screw them up.  And they stay on my impossible nails.  There's nothing remotely as good.  Love these!!!!",5
"I don't think any nail polish manufacturer creates as many different colors of nail polish as Essie, and I like almost all of them! This one is a lovely slightly violet polish in the red range. It's perfect for people like me who wear a lot of cool colors and have blue based coloring. The color in the bottle looks exactly like one in the photo on my screen, and slightly more red when it dried on my nails. I like it a lot. This color glides on very easily and almost covers in one coat. I did have to use a second coat to completely cover all the little spots that I missed the first time around. The polish looks good on its own, but the gel topcoat really sets it off. It gives my nails a hard, very shiny finish and helps to protect the manicure. It also smoothes out any imperfections that may have occurred when applying the first two coats. Don't skip it! The topcoat can also be worn on its own over bare nails for a nice shiny, finished look. But with so many beautiful Essie colors, why would you want to?

This polish was still going strong with only a hint of wear on the tip of one nail after 7 days. The top coat was still extremely shiny. My nails show growth at the base of the nail, so I usually change polish after 7 days. But if not for that, I probably could have gotten another couple days out of this polish. Great product!",5
"If I could give this duo six stars, I would. The combination of these two is, without a doubt, the best offering essie has ever put out there.

First of all, I hate it when you get a cream polish and it takes three or four coats in order to get it to look opaque. There was so much pigmentation in this nail polish that I could have gotten by with just one coat, although I put on two. The photograph shows the two coats on my hand.
After doing one hand, the polish started to thicken up a little on my second hand. I've noticed that this often happens with quick dry formulas. No problem, I just wait a minute and then reshake the bottle.
If you don't do that, it can come out thick, which makes it a little streaky or textured. Even if that's the case, all of those imperfections disappear when you apply this magical top coat. No, I'm not exaggerating. It really is Magic.
It evens the color and gives you a perfect shine that lasts for days and days.

And here is the part that I want to shout out... If all of the above weren't enough to make you really love this stuff, hold on because there's more.
I have long complained that I don't like the Essie nail polish brushes. They're great if you have small and short nails, in my opinion, but not for me.
The brush has a perfect curve that matches the base of your nail, and it's wider so that with three strokes, middle side, and side, you are DONE. The brush holds just the right amount of polish.
This review is for the VIPlease color. I think of it as a hibiscus or raspberry shade.
It looks great when you're wearing blue, pink, and even certain shades of burgundy. It's absolutely stunning with tropical prints that include flowers and greenery.
Getting the kit is a great way to try the top coat.
If your experience is as good as mine, this will be the only topcoat you ever use from now on.",5
"This is probably the ""smoothest"" tasting mouthwash I have ever used. It is a subtle mint flavor, yet still leaves your mouth feeling fresh. ""Smooth"" fits the flavor/strength perfectly. It is not harsh at all, but still effective.

This mouthwash claims to help with inflammation and soreness of the gums. I'd say this claim is true. I wear braces and do get inflamed/sore gums from time to time. Crest Pro-Health For Life has helped with that. It actually soothes the gums. The inflammation goes away much quicker.

I used this in my WaterPik with great results as well. Normally, I fill it up half way with warm water and the rest of the way with Listerine. My orthodontist recommended this on account of the gaps I get from my braces, to clean good and disinfect the loose gum area and to help the irritation/inflammation. I feel like this Pro-Health does a better job in that area - it feels like it is soothing the sore spots and like I said, the inflammation, soreness and redness goes away much faster.

I did ask my orthodontist about using this mouthwash, if it would be beneficial to me in regards to the gum issues, since this product is meant for people over 50 years of age - I am only 36. He said it definitely could not hurt to try and would probably work well since it is made for gum issues. He told me to let him know how it goes. When I told him I believed it worked better and helped more, he told me to continue to use it. When he looked in my mouth in order to determine the adjustments for my braces during that visit, he mentioned to me that 2 particular areas look better than usual. The gum line at two specific teeth was always more red than any other area, even though it was never actually painful or swollen. Since I started using the Pro-Health, that redness has gone away.

To me, this product is very beneficial, while being gentle. There is no harsh alchohol taste, no nasty after taste. It is just simply a smooth mint flavor, just like the bottle says, that makes your mouth taste and feel fresh. In my case, it definitely did help with gum problems and for that reason I will continue to use it regularly.",5

"I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like ""Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?"" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:

1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.
2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.
3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.
4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.
5. Read #4 again.
6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.
7. Marvel at how much lint came out.
8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.
9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.

Hope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!",5
"We have 24 foot of solid dryer vent pipe ending in 3 right-angles before going through the floor into the flexible dryer-vent hose coming from the dryer.  I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.  As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.  A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer.",5
"So, this is what life comes down to when you are 50 years old:  reviewing dryer vent cleaners while sitting at your kitchen table waiting for American Idol.  This is not what I envisioned when I was 12, I can tell you that much.  You kids who think it won't happen to you?

It will.  Sorry to burst your bubble.

That said, the product works great.  Our dryer pretty much stopped working and we were thinking we needed a new one, which was seriously going to eat into my plastic surgery budget.  One last shot before a trip to the appliance store was this Gardus LintEater.  My husband, who is not the handy one of the family, had to do the work as I have a torn labrum.  (Which sounds dirtier than it is - that's part of your shoulder.)  He, the clumsiest man in the world, had absolutely no problem using this.  I warned him to read the directions first, and he actually listened and followed.  He hooked it up to the drill, and away he went.  He got a bunch of musty, wet lint that had probably been up inside the wall since 1977  - probably consisting of bell bottom material and macram.

Now our dryer actually dries clothes again, and I can continue to save for my facelift. Thank you Gardus.",5
"This review is for Gardus RLE202 LintEater 10-Piece Rotary Dryer Vent Cleaning System

Weve been paying $75 per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every 4-5 months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wall.

We knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didn't dry very well and right near the end when it REALLY needed cleaning, there would actually be water on the floor under the dryer.

I had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came. I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!

I did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!

Like with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.

The pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.

Disconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.

- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!

- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.

- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.

- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.

- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.

NOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.

- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.

- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly. Turn the dryer ON to blow out the loosened lint as you clean the pipe, wear googles or something to keep the lint dust out of your eyes and off you go!",5
"The lint eater is amazing! We recently bought a house that was built in 2001 and previously owned by an older lady, so I assumed the dryer vent had never been cleaned. Before setting up the dryer, I wanted to give the vent line a thorough cleaning for safety's sake and to help the dryer run as efficiently as possible. Well, I'm glad I did! The exterior cover on the vent had been gone for some time, and the amount of leaves and pine needles plus lint wads that I got out were shocking! It seemed like every time I ran the LintEater through line, it dislodged another fist-sized wad of stuff. When I first hooked up the shop vac inside the house, and went out to the vent exit, there was almost zero air getting sucked in. The wads were so huge that they kept stopping up my shop vac hose and I had to keep going inside to clean it out. After all was said and done, my vent line is free-flowing and working as good as new. Glad I spent the money on this product!

Helpful tip - when I started, I just jammed all of the rods together and tried to work it into the vent line. It's way too unwieldy this way, and every time you hit the power on the drill, the rods get kinked and knotted up because they're so flexible. Start with one, and when that one gets most of the way into the vent line, add another. Repeat as necessary and you'll have a MUCH easier time.",5
"Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that lets you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle.

I was just wanting to clean out a potential fire hazard but it really does make a big difference running through a dirty vent vs. a clean one. Might be due to the long length of my vent but very happy with this product.",5
"Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures.  My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent.  That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit.  This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.
I noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.  Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.  I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.  A little price to pay for a clean vent.",5

"As you can see, it's very cute. I ordered different gift cards in various dollar amounts, but I kept each gift card style to the amount the same, i.e. the mini-Amazon boxes contained only $50 gift cards. Thank goodness because each box was shrink-wrapped because there was no indication of the dollar amount on the box itself and I was much too lazy to unwrap them to check them all.

But, if you felt compelled to rip off the shrink-wrap, you can open the box and check because it's not a taped box - it's MAGNETIC!! Yes, the box is held closed by hidden magnetic force, which isn't strong but is strong enough to keep the box closed. Amazing!

I don't know how Amazon makes money off of these clever gift card containers that are shipped, but I'm sure there's some mathematical and habitual wizardry regarding gift cards and spending.

This is a fun way to make gift card giving more fun.",5
"This review is for the Amazon Gift Card (any amount) in the Mini Amazon Shipping Box:

Do you get excited when your Amazon Shipment arrives at your door? The sight of the brown Amazon box & the excitement of getting a new delivery? If so, then you are going to LOVE the little gift box that this gift card comes in. I've ordered many of the Amazon tins, & some with the greeting cards, & this is one of my favorites!  It is Super Adorable, & a great way to give a gift card for any Amazon Fan!

The little brown box is about 4.5"" x 3"" x 1"" tall. The inside comes with a removable brown flap that holds the gift card perfectly.

Open the flap & it reveals the gift card inside. The top flaps seem like they are magnetic because when you go to reclose they snap back into place. The bottom has a clear window that allows you to see inside. Small print on the back- Amazon Gift cards, made in China. I chose the ""Thank you"" gift card. (see attached pics). This little gift box comes free with the purchase of your gift card. You can reuse it, or swap out the gift card if you choose.

It arrives with inside an outer box, so it should arrive safe & sound.

Would it make a great gift? Definitely!  Amazon is a great card to give because there are So many choices of what to spend it on. Unlike other gift cards where you are stuck to a particular retailer/restaurant. etc, this gives you a variety. I like purchasing gift cards in $25 quantities so I can have a quick gift in hand just in case I need a quick or unexpected gift.

Recommended for:  I recommend this for anyone who loves shopping on Amazon. If you or your gift recipient love getting that Amazon brown box delivery, then you will be giddy when you see this adorable box!

Ideas: You can purchase this & swap out the gift cards. So, for example, it doesnt appear they are still offering the thank you card with this box (like when I bought it).  You could purchase one of the other ""thank you"" gift cards (in box, card, etc), & then purchase a one of these mini box ones & swap the 2 cards. Or use 1 of the gift cards for yourself for future purchases.

At the time I'm writing this review, it appears you can purchase the gift cards in $25-$2000 amounts. There are 2 posts for this particular mini box style with birthday icons & classic white gift card offerings.

Love this little brown box & I will be ordering more. 5 Stars. Happy Shopping! :)",5
Love to get this gift card for relatives and friends.  Who can't find something tasty at Starbucks and it's fun to pop in there to treat yourself during the day.  Your relatives and friends will think of you each time they use the card.  Good to remind them to register the card with Starbucks in case it gets lost.  I got this for my mail lady as a thank you for bringing all of those Amazon boxes up to the door in the winter and rain.  It's a great gift to send to a loved one.,5
"I was lucky to buy this for $20 as part of the ""Today's Deals"" so I got an extra $5 on the card. The card arrived really fast. I read some reviews that said they received cards with 0 credit on them. I logged on to Regal's site and verified I had a $25 balance so I'm happy. I go to Regal every week so this card helps me to get a free soda with the $5 I saved off of the original price. I hope they do this deal again soon. Too bad you can only buy 1 card at the special price.",5
"This review is for the Brinker Gift Card that can be used at any of the 4 restaurants: Chili's, Macaroni Grill, Maggianos, or On the Border. These are great for gifts because recipient has a choice of which restaurant to use the gift card at. We usually go to Chilis & Maggianos at least once a month. Tip: Look for gift card promotions (I've seen some on Amazon Lightening Deals & deals towards the Holidays) & check the restaurants websites for promos too for joining their newsletter/ frequent guest programs. Chilis & Maggianos email coupons occasionally when you sign up for their newsletters, & these can be combined along with using these gift cards.",5
"Ordered two of these for our 3  year old and 6 year old Granddaughters. They had a great time going to the Build - A - Bear store and picking out their animal, outfits, and accessories. The 6 year old settled on a traditional bear, while the 3 year old opted for a bunny rabbit with dresses and other accessories. It appears that $50 is about the right amount of money to put on the card(yes, that seems expensive to me, but what do I know about these things). Fun gift for the kids when you don't know what to buy them.",5
"We love Maggiano's and Macaroni Grill.  Great food, especially at Maggiano's where we do a lot of take-out.  But Maggiano's can get pricey so discounted gift cards really help out.

Obviously gift cards are primarily for gift giving, so that is really the only time you should pay full price for a gift card. When you are buying a gift card for yourself, it is really pointless unless you are getting a decent percentage off. We bought this gift card for ourselves when it was 20% off as a Lightning Deal around Christmas time which is a great price. Best bet is to keep an eye on the Lightning Deals for gift cards and see if you can snag a good deal.",5
"I love AMC.  It is my go-to choice for movie theaters in my area.  I go to a lot of movies and I always try to find gift cards at a discount.  Even better, a few months ago, they started accepting AMC Gift Cards on the Fandango iOS App, so I get a discount and pre-ordered tickets for every move I go to (no ticket fee if you are a AMC Stubs member).

"How do I love thee, Oh, Logan's delicious Steak! Let me count the wonderful ways....I love thee lightly seasoned and cooked to perfection, as only Logan's Roadhouse can do.  I love thee alongside a delightful bucket of peanuts, which always await the hungry steak ordering customer right on the table. I love thee slathered with oh so delicious bourbon glaze or seasoned butter.  I love thee next to the mouth watering fresh yeast dinner rolls, which are served up hastily and a-plenteously!  I love thee, O Logan's, thou great and inexpensive Roadhouse restaurant, which beckons with delightful cowboy decor and a peanut-shell laden floor.  I love your buttery perfection you call broccoli, and I love your chicken and salmon dishes as well.

Hence, I love your most amazing $25 gift card, for which I only have to pay a mere $20.  Now, off to Logan's I go, for a meal fit for two for only $20!

I have never had a bad experience at Logan's.  The steak is always ALWAYS cooked to perfection.  Seasoned just right.  Meat-a-tarians, buy this card!!",5
"I feel like Amazon should limit what can have a product review. I mean seriously, it's a gift card. I guess if you received it and got a paper cut, you may want to warn people that there is that potential hazard. Or maybe you didn't get the correct design, to which I say again, it's a gift card. You're not getting married to it. You'll most likely toss it when you're done with it. I guess there is the chance that the card is not active when you receive it, but even still, that's not the cards fault, it is the card activator person's fault..we should be able to review them and their performance...'my card's activation seemed to be a little slow, even faulty at times. Maybe the card activator person needs more training.' For the record, my card worked, no paper cut, and the design was perfect!",5
"We do a lot of shopping at JCPenney these days.  We buy a lot of stuff there, especially kids clothes.  They have nice prices on kids school uniforms so we stock up at the beginning of the school year every year.  Combining a discounted gift card with the in-store sales and coupons really saves a lot.

"Received this gift card for $20 during a lightning deal.  I know many people are down on Panda Express because it is not ""authentic"" Chinese food but I like the food and this gift card helps purchase some when my funds are a little low.  I buy the gift cards and use them when we normally go or will use them when money is tight right before payday.  The lightning deals are great and will save you between $5 and $20 depending on how much you spend.",5
"How can you go wrong with a Subway Gift Card? We all love going there for an occasional lunch or quick dinner. The food is not expensive, can be very healthy if you choose carefully, and the restaurant we go to is always tremendously clean. So, when a teen in our family asked for a gift card as a gift, I had no problem with it. Best of all, it was delivered to her, along with another gift from Amazon! Love it!",5
"Honestly, these are great to give to your teens to ensure the money you give them gets used for what is supposed to be used for.  I like giving gift cards to them and know that they are using them for food, not video games or Sephora, cigarettes, or anything they could get into trouble for.  I know they at least are eating if I give them a gift card, not that they couldn't sell it, but, still better than money.  Good for traveling or if you're worried about carrying a purse with you or otherwise getting your cash stolen.  I've never had a problem with one not working, and I usually purchase directly from the local restaurant because they usually have a deal: buy a $25 gift card, receive a 6"" sub FREE.  So, win-win for everyone.",5
"We love all of the Outback family restaurants.  Outback, Bonefish, Roy's, Carrabba's, you can't go wrong with some great food.  Kids menu is also great.

"My son and daughter-in-law work full time in a small midwestern town.  There aren't many restaurants in town, but there's a Domino Pizza.  So, when they don't want to cook, or have students over - my son is a professor - they can serve up some classic Domino Pizza.  Figured this would give them an excuse to not cook and have a break.  I called the Domino's in their town as recommended to ensure they take gift cards and they do!  My daughter-in-law likes this pizza, so figured these gift cards would make her happy!",5
"Yes, I'm leaving a review for a gift card because I had no idea what to expect and it took an embarrassingly long time to realize there is an actual gift card in the contraption.

You see the image which resembles a wide paper bag? You have to rip that piece of firm cardboard apart to reveal a gift card inside. There is no perforation anywhere, nor can you feel the gift card through the cardboard ""envelope."" The back has a barcode and such, so I thought maybe that was what needs to be scanned at checkout, but no. Again, there's a card inside.

Attached is a picture with a ruler and the gift card next to the cardboard.

The card worked as expected at Whole Foods. Thank goodness I figured out there was a gift card inside because I would've looked really dumb, forcing the cashier to scan the package's barcode, instead of the gift card.",5
"Love these come in handy when I need to run into a store, and pick up some lunch or dinner at their food bars. The prices may be a bit high but so worth it! especially if you single like good organics. Great gift idea for those who are picky to shop for love gift cards so easy. So far I have had no problems with the first two I had purchased earlier this year the balance was as it said, and the cashier just scanned it without any problems :)",5
"Good Breads, Good pastries, and a lot more to enjoy. I find when I get these I check the balance immediately as mistakes can be made and you don't find out until you go to shop with the card that there is nothing on it. Good to always check the balance, and if you give it as a gift make sure you tell the person to check the balance. Otherwise love these gift cards so much easier than just giving money what better than to give someone a gift of a place they enjoy to eat at or shop at.",5
"Love to get and give gift cards to favorite eateries as it compels you to go out.  We like Paneras soups and sandwiches.  The tomato and broccoli and cheese soup are our favorites.  This is a pleasant eatery for a light and quick meal which is healthier than most fast food.  Love to give these to family members, as sometimes they invite you along to enjoy the card with them.  It's great that Amazon has so many choices like this restaurant among their gift card selections.  When family and friends have enough stuff, giving a gift card for an experience like this makes a thoughtful gift.",5
"These are simply great.  I like to use them as gifts, but a couple of unique things I love to use them for is for teacher gifts and for guy gifts.  I like to make a little ""floral arrangement"" with various gift cards by putting in a basket or flower pot and sticking these on craft sticks (or the long Starbucks stir sticks since they're perfect long size, wooden and free) and filling in with either homemade, wrapped cake pops or various candies. You can add a $25 card along with various denominations of other cards such as Starbucks, Panera, Olive Garden, Target, Home Depot, Kroger, Papa John's....the possibilities are endless.  They have been raved over by every single person I have given them to and they make a beautiful and unique presentation.",5
"Love to give restaurant gift cards to family members as you sometimes get to accompany them when they use the card!  And if any of your family is frugal, the card compels them to go out and have a little fun.  Love this restaurant.  Went there tonight.  Their hamburgers are great, as is the side garden salad.  We also sampled a raspberry white chocolate truffle cheesecake.  Yum!  Will be ordering these cards for Father's Day.",5
"I'm going to have to give 5 stars for this product. I like the fact a gift card let's the  birthday person spend it the way they'd like to. The downside, is that a gift card,  seems alittle impersonal; you couldn't make the choice on what to give someone? I can make a choice, and my choice is to let the birthday person splurge on whatever tickles their fancy. Hence, the gift card. I'm a practical person myself, but I'd probaly loose my mind if I recieved a vacuum or sink mats for my bd. So a gift card is a safe bet. :) The tin is just adorable too, an extra little pop.",5
"Amazon gift card in an adorable cupcake shaped tin- what's not to love? The Amazon card makes a great gift & the bonus tin is ""icing on the cake"". ;)  The bonus tin is about 4"" x 4.5"" & one of the cutest ways to give a gift card as a gift. The inside has a removable black lining insert to hold the gift card. The back has a clear window, & says ""Amazon gift cards"" in very small print.  The tin is reusable & can be used to hold other small items or change. Very nice that Amazon offers this adorable tin with their gift cards.

Amazon gift cards make a great gift because the selection of products offered on this website is Huge!  Unlike giving a gift card to a specific store, restaurant, or for a specific item (i.e. movie tickets, waterparks, etc), an Amazon gift card can be used for whatever the receiver wants. That's a huge perk in gift giving. Other recommendations: Buy it to have on hand as a gift. You never know when you'll be invited to a party or have an event come up where you'll need a quick gift.  No more running around store to store. You'll have this gift on hand.  Another idea- purchase it for yourself. Maybe you know you will want to buy something later in the year. Hang onto the gift card, then you can always easily add it to your account, or right into a family or friends account.",5
"I love the convenience of these gift cards. Especially that you can just email them to yourself or other as a gift. It an easy pay to pay to go out to eat at almost any major restaurant. Very easy to use, just click email, print or show it on your cell phone to the waitress. Will continue to buy for any of my restaurant needs. These tend to deliver in about 5 to 10 minutes. Makes gift giving extremely easy. Love these!",5
"Absolutely love FRIDAYS!! Having a gift card available at your fingertips, makes it even better. Usually these arrive within 5 minutes, I have only had an issue a few times with it not arriving on time. Very easy to use, just print once you receive the email, or just show the card on your cell phone, take into the restaurant and use immediately. Makes paying quick and easy. I absolutely love that you can get these emailed to you as well. This process makes sending and receiving gift card exceptionally easy. Love it! Will buy more in the future.",5
"It's day 78 on the road since we left. Our full story @ earthen_religion on Instagram & YouTube.
I am not into panhandling or begging since we ( Two Border Collies) set out to move. But when the weather turned cold & food started to run short. The choice was fuel to keep moving or food. Then while at a library. I remembered I have an Amazon Store Card..... Lor got a jacket to stay warm in that matches Holigraph's jacket. Some Purina moist dog for them both. Jack links to share with them, along with Cheezit's. But to look far enough into Amazon & find the section of Gift cards..... OMG!
Got the Domino's Pizza E-Gift card. It came 27 1/2mins after purchase. This e-card is BTW the MVP. Cause: Eta could be 5- 30mins for when you get the e-card. Dominos are open until 1am in some places. Once I had the code me & the girls split some Kicker chicken nuggets. Which when living outdoors in a perpetual state. Real food is prized.
 Then had the Taco Bell & Burger King gift cards sent to my Address on the road. When online at both to check balances after they showed up 24hrs later.
This even after the payments I'll end up making is far better than freezing or being hungry.",5
"Bought this gift card from the Deal of the Day so I saved money ($10 to be exact), which is great. I received an email saying estimated delivery time is within 5 minutes, but could be delayed a little pending credit card authorization. Well my credit card company authorized the charge immediately, but it took over 4 hours to receive the e-gift card. Slow delivery time, but since I got it at a cheaper price I don't mind.",5
"This gift box is very attractive for the gift card.  I bought this Cracker Barrel card for my son who is saving money for the future and doesn't splurge very often to go out. I like to give gift cards to restaurants as you are buying someone an experience, a bit of deliciousness and fun to break up the routine of home-cooked meals. The box is included free with the gift cards, which is great.  You don't have to wrap the cards and it makes for an attractive gift.  You can recycle the box for other gift cards.",5

"We love Olive Garden, and I particularly love Olive Garden for lunch during the work week.  One reason I really love the gift card is that I can use it to pay for both myself and my dining friend better than using cash.  When I am paying with cash, several of my friends argue about it and insist on paying.  Sometimes, I want to pay, and I don't want them feeling guilty or fighting over who is paying.  When you have a gift card, you can just say, ""Let me pay.  I have this gift card.""  They never turn down the offer.

Now, about the restaurant.  I love nearly all the menu items, but I really REALLLLY love the Zuppa Toscana, so I usually get the unlimited soup, salad & breadsticks lunch special for $6.99.  Lunch is served fast and I always can get in and out in under an hour.  They always let me take the rest with me, even happy to provide more soup, salad and breadsticks and box it up, so, since I'm single, that's dinner.  Always great service, and let's not forget the after dinner mints.  YUM!",5
"I like getting the lightning deals for gift cards on Amazon.  Getting a $50 card for $40 is always cool especially if I normally use it or shop there anyway.  I bought this to use when we go to the movies and getting $10 free more than compensates for the extra 2 dollar charge for each ticket.  I like getting my ticket before going to the theater since it avoids the line of getting a ticket and since so many theaters now have reserved seating, it is almost becoming mandatory.  If you are running late, having your ticket already is a life saver.  The eticket is nice because I often place gift cards in drawers or weird places and have to go find them.  I can access this ticket on my phone or a computer.  How convenient!",5
"Amazon gift cards are nothing new, and they are very handy to give as gifts due to the diverse nature of products Amazon offers  certainly your recipient can find something he / she will like to order.

Super cute!  This design is cute for many different holidays- birthdays, Valentines Day, Christmas, Anniversary or even a ""Just because I love you"".

I plan on putting this in a wedding card as a gift for an upcoming wedding. The top flap opens up, & it has a pull card you pull out to reveal the gift card. At the time of purchase, Amazon is offering this adorable card holder free with a $15.00+ gift card. The gift card is black with the Amazon logo. The envelope is 4"" x 4.5"" x .5 cm.  It will add some weight if you are mailing inside another card, so be sure to check your postage. You can't go wrong with giving gift cards as a gift, & this adorable envelope dresses up your gift & would be great for a wedding or anniversary.

"I was weary about purchasing this product because of all of those 1-star reviews. I decided to take the plunge, though, because I had $65 on my Amazon Gift Card balance. My Prime membership had expired, I hoped that I could use my Amazon Gift card balance to renew it, but for whatever reason, it doesn't appear to be possible. I wanted to treat myself, though, so I went ahead and took a chance on this e-gift card for Ulta so I could pick up some skin care and makeup necessities. Very glad that I did, despite the reviews. That being said, there are a few things that I have learned from buying e-gift cards on Amazon, and I hope these tips can help. First, for in-person orders, do not bother having them scan the bar code, it never works - instead, just read the numbers off to them, simple. Second, if you copy and paste the 16 digit card number, you will need to manually remove the spaces or else it won't register (that's how it is with Dominos, anyway). Dumb, I know, but if it isn't working, try removing the spaces just in case. Third, when shopping at Ulta.com you CANNOT use more than one gift card. Why is that a problem? Because to use the ENTIRETY of my Amazon balance, I had to purchase two separate cards in the amounts of $30 and $35. I didn't want any remaining balance lingering as I have no idea when I'll have the extra funds to renew my Prime membership. This was an inconvenience because I had to split my Ulta purchases into two separate orders. Fourth, apparently the recipient needs to have an Amazon membership. If you are gifting a young person who isn't able to make an Amazon account you could always send the gift card to yourself and then send the card number and pin to the recipient. I have purchased E-Gift Cards off of Amazon for the following companies: P.F. Chang's, Domino's, Ulta, Panda Express, and Chipotle, and haven't had any issues with any of them. It just sounds like Amazon customer service isn't very good at helping people troubleshoot technical issues Order was successful, and if you are still reading, I really hope that this review has helped you make a decision regarding whether or not to purchase. If you have the time, it is usually worthwhile to go for the physical card, but these E-Gift cards are still quite convenient if you are in a pinch or have a long-distance recipient.",5

The gift card has the amount printed on the front. The back of the envelope has a see thru window opening so you can see the bar code, & 2 blank lines you can use to write a message.",5
"LOVE this bear! Amazon is running this promo - free Holiday teddy bear with purchase of Amazon Gift Card.  It arrived, & it was better than described!

"I think that in terms of overall content presented, 'Conde Nast Traveler' is the best travel magazine currently on the market. Some other reviewers have raised some valid points concerning article length, and bias toward upscale properties. I think that there are other magazines that might be more suitable for others, including 'Budget Travel' and 'National Geographic Traveler', both of which I also subscribe to and enjoy, though they both have their limitations and issues as well.
So what sets 'Conde Nast' apart? I think it is the willingness to find new and exciting vacation destinations that are still reasonable enough to get to as to make them worthwhile to a large audience. Some of the more exotic magazines have great articles on hiking in Tibet and the like, but how many people are really able to do that (or can afford to do it?) My point is that although it is by no means perfect, I think the editors and writers do consciously strike a balance between the too mundane and too exotic (and expensive) and attempt to focus the majority of the magazine in that area.
This is just too good of a magazine to pass up. The 'Deals of the Month' section alone justifies the price. Of all the travel magazines I read on a monthly basis (currently four) 'Conde Nast Traveler' is my favorite and I highly recommend it.",5
"It's important to understand that this magazine isn't about budget travel.  It's for people who travel for business, where a corporation is paying, and for those who can afford to travel luxuriously for pleasure, at least occasionally.  I love reading about exotic destinations, the top spas and bath experiences in the world, and amazing travel experiences.  It has gorgeous photography, interesting articles, and solid information.  Even if I can't afford to take trips like this every year, I still want to read about them.  If I'm going to take a once-in-a-lifetime trip I'll want to know just where to say and what to do.  When I went
to Florida I stayed in budget places except for the last night, when we went to the Hotel Fontainebleau on Miami Beach, which was wonderful.  It's important to know and decide when to save money and when it's worth it to splurge.

I almost gave my subscription up because with physical disabilities it's unlikely I can do a lot of travel.  But I still want to dream about it.  I'd love a travel magazine that included information about vacation travel ideas for those of us who can't walk or stand for hours.  So many travel articles urge the traveler to get out and walk, but that isn't possible for all of us.  Conde Nast is a lot less likely to urge long impossible hikes on me than National Geographic Traveler.",5
"House Beautiful has as much quality to offer the reader as many magazines that are at a higher price range; thick glossy pages, superb photography, and for those who need some inspiration for home and garden improvements, a plethora of useful design ideas.
I just received my September 2003 issue, and some of the contents are:
The interior: A nice ""How to"" page, with solutions that will fit your pocketbook, and make your home interesting; ""Designer Challenge"", a new series where experts tackle ""problem areas""; a long article on ""The Next Wave"", profiling twentyfive up-and-coming designers who are ""rising stars from coast to coast""; an in-depth look at 4 gorgeous homes: A sparse but elegant Edwardian house in Dallas, a plantation-style house in Georgia, a classic home in the Georgetown area of Washington, D.C., and my favorite, a minimalist, lavishly comfortable duplex in Miami, Florida.
The exterior: ""Art Imitating Nature"", a Phoenix Arizona garden that uses native plants in a way that blends into the architecture. Food: ""Fruit Under Fire"", a luscious collection of recipes for grilled fruit, with close-up illustrations that are enough to stir up the appetite.
Every issue will spark some ideas on how to enhance your surroundings, how to buy on a budget, how to experiment by mixing styles, and much more. I enjoy every issue, and think House Beautiful is one of the best magazine values on the market.",5

- Ten Things:  a ""watch out"" list of 10 things that you should know about the different professionals you interact with (your dentist, your accountant, a real estate broker, etc.).  Always an eye-opener.
- Stock Screen:  Paul Sturm is a knowledgeable, value-oriented journalist who puts together a list each month of 8-10 stocks that make it through a rigid screen of several characteristics.  Each month, he features a different screen and he uses a good mix of quantitative characteristics and common sense to generate the list.
- Feature articles that profile common people and the serious personal finance problems they have endured (e.g., collecting on insurance, fighting the IRS, traveling overseas).
SmartMoney is frequently compared to Money magazine, but Money is often more narrowly focused on investing and it sometimes dumbs down its articles.  I also read BusinessWeek, Forbes and Fortune regularly.  While they all have their place, none provides the depth and common sense focus of SmartMoney when it comes to personal finance.  I have photocopied and saved countless articles and I sometimes refer to them years later.  ...  my advice is to get a subscription now - it's definitely worth it.",5
"If it is in Vogue, it IS in fashion! This magazine, which has existed since 1892, is one of the premier magazines for women. It is an American magazine, but also has Australian, Brazilian, British, French, German, Italian, and Spanish Editions. It covers fashion, beauty, health, fitness, celebrities, movies, art, and other topics of interest to women. Vogue is mainly directed at the Jet-Set, but anyone will find its pages both entertaining, and informative. I have a subscription to it, and I collect it on the basis of its collectibility. Mine arrive in clear plastic bags, which are never opened (unless of course one of my favorite celebritie's is on the cover). I wish all magazine publishers used the clear bag method of shipping, because an subscription label directly on the cover of a magazine is frowned upon by most collectors. So unless you buy it right off the shelf, or it is bagged, most collectors will not be interested in it. Getting back to Vogue, if you want to keep up with what is IN in fashion, this is the magazine to have. You know those $1,000 dresses you've heard about? You'll find many of them modeled in here! Fashions photographed by some of the world's most renowned photographers, are featured in the magazine. If you're someone who enjoys reading about the Elite in women's topics, you'll want to subscribe to VOGUE.",5
"A real favorite in this magazine is the page of quotes, It is sure to bring a smile or teach you something about life. They also always have cleaning tips, health topics, diet and exercise solutions, true stories, beauty hints, inspirational articles, soul nourishing tips, recipes, recipes and more recipes, family/children, flowers, end of the magazine article to make you think about life, and gardening hints.

If you want to find a cover story fast, they have an ""on our cover"" section in the index. In Every Issue there is a shopper's guide and a recipe index.

The articles are helpful and in the March 2002 issue they had an article on how to be less stressed. They also had an article on PCOS which is apparently more common than we women think.

The beauty sections show you the newest fashion and you can decide if you want to adapt your style to the trends. Always seems rather chic.

Some of the recipes in the March 2002 issue included:

A luscious Lemon Coconut Pound Cake
Coconut Macaroons
Peanut Butter Oat Bars
Baby Cheesecakes - really cute
Banana Salsa
French Oven Beef Stew
Pasta with Shrimp

The recipes are not difficult and seem practical.

Even the advertising in this magazine is colorful and fun.

A Very ""American Gal"" type magazine.
Nothing fancy, just real life.

~The Rebecca Review",5
"I have subscribed to this magazine for over four years.  I like that this magazine is constantly fresh and doesn't seem to get stales.  There are always great articles about what is new and upcoming in techonology, new trends on the Internet.  Some magazines have a lot of filler and tend to be a vehicle for selling advertisements.

What makes Wired extra special is that they don't pander to products that they do advertising for.  Unlike other computer related magazines they write about trends, and outstanding products.  This leaves them more room for good reporting and less veiled advertising.  They often feature articles written by famous people in techonology.

I have operated a cooking website since 1995, so I am familar with the Internet, and how it works.  What I like about Wired magazine is that they constantly write about what's new and upcoming in trends for the online world, and they tend to be very on the mark with where the Internet is and where it is going.

If you are interested in techonology, and what is going on online this is the magazine for you.  Wired magazine is fresh, and is free of pandering to the products they help advertise.  I like that this magazine is high on content and low in advertisements.  Always fresh content about new products in techonology, trends in the high tech world, and a good insight on the Internet make this magazine an excellent choice.",5
"Seventeen has been around for 60 years, and tons of teenagers have grown up with it. Recently, Seventeen got a new look and feel, with more mature articles and interesting features for older teeens. Seventeen is good for those teens who feel like they've outgrown other teen magazines but want one that will guide them through college and beyond.
Seventeen features many stuff that teens like to read about- the latest celebrity news, CD and movie release dates, fashion and beauty tips, love and romance, real-life stories, fun stuff to do, and more. As an added bonus, Seventeen covers more worldwide issues then other teen magazines and gives them to you from a teen's point of view. Seventeen also gives you plenty of college and sex advice, which older readers will connect with.
What I love about Seventeen is not only the plentiful amounts of news and real-life stories, but also that it features many bargain items in the Fashion section that are awesome and affordable. Seventeen is a wonderful magazine for bargain shopppers- it features plenty of clothes, make-up, hair products, and jewelry for those with smaller budgets. Additionally, the health and fitness pull outs in each issue are wonderful! Seventeen has plenty of nutrition tips and simple workouts that'll have you seeing lots of results fast.
Seventeen is a wonderful magazine overall- highly recommended.",5
"Are you someone who likes to keep up with the latest trends in fashion? Are you someone who is concerned about health and beauty issues? Are you a person who loves to read about celebrities as well as the latest in music, movies, and TV? Then Seventeen is for YOU!!! In fact, Seventeen has all of these and much more! From recipes to inspiring life stories, from sex to cool celebrity photos, Seventeen is packed with informative and entertaining articles, plus, lots of cool colorful photographs.
According to the Audit Bureau of Circulations list of the 100 best selling magazines in the United States, Seventeen is ranked 25th, but none of the ones above Seventeen on the list are directed at teens and young women, thus, making Seventeen the best selling magazine for young readers. It has over 2,000,000 readers to date, and that number is growing. But, not only is Seventeen a best seller, it's also one of the most sought after collectibles in the world! At auctions, I've seen editions from the 70's and 80's sell for as much as [money]each, depending on things such as condition, who was on the cover, etc. And I've noticed that editions of Seventeen do not have to be very old to bring a good price. I've seen editions as little as 2 years old sell for upwards of [money] each. I fell in love with the magazine when I was 17. I was in class when I noticed one of my classmates reading a copy. As I peered over her shoulder, I seen in the magazine one of the most beautiful girls in the world. Turned out, the model would later turn into one of the hottest actresses in film----Phoebe Cates. So I asked my classmate where I could get a copy and she told me I could find them in most any store or get them by subscription. So because of Phoebe Cates, I started collecting the magazine just for her lovely pics. Later, stars such as Brooke Shields,and Jennifer Connelly kept me buying the magazine. Then I began to read the articles and found them both interesting and informative. I can say with assurance that some of the articles in Seventeen have helped keep me looking younger and healthier. So while Seveteen is directed mainly at young women between the ages of 12 and 20, guys can also benefit from some of its contents. It's a magazine that has existed since 1944, and is a favorite among every class of people. If you would like a magazine that is great to read and can be worth something as a collectible in the future, you cannot beat SEVENTEEN!!!",5
"This is simply a beautiful magazine, printed on heavy, glossy paper. Its pages contain many beautiful photographs of different foods, wines, and the countries from which they originate. It is not only a food and wine magazine with wonderful recipes that are easy to follow, it is also a travel guide of sorts with a great deal of information on other countries, their food and wine, their  restaurants, and their culture. Usually included are some fascinating historical details of how a custom associated with a particular food may have come about. The articles are invariably well-written and offer a wealth of fascinating information.

I am a tea lover, and I love going to afternoon tea with its repast of scones, dainty sandwiches, and light cakes. So, I particularly enjoyed an article that the magazine recently had that focused on tea. It transported the reader to Devon, England with its afternoon tradition of  tea and scones, accompanied by clotted cream and  jam, which is often referred to as a cream tea. Of course, a beautiful bone china tea pot and bone china cups are essential to the having of a proper cup of tea. This, too, is discussed in the article. Photographs of an authentic village tearoom in Devon were included, as well as recipes for making scones, tea sandwiches, black currant jam, strawberry jam, and Victoria Sponge Cake.

The article went on to discuss how clotted cream is made. It interspersed the discussion with personal anecdotes from those who make clotted cream. A guide was included for Devon in terms of where to stay, where to eat, and where to go for tea. The article went on to discuss the differences among the various available tea experiences, detailing what constitutes an afternoon tea, a cream tea, and a high tea, and giving some of the historical underpinnings of each.  I so enjoyed this article! Even if I never physically go to Devon, I feel as if the magazine had transported me there, as it was vividly drawn by so expert and sure a hand. The magazine has these types of articles in every issue, covering regions from all over the world, including those in the United States.

The magazine also contains a helpful section titled, ""The Pantry"", which is a guide to resources that have to do with food products and kitchenware related to articles in the current issue of the magazine. This makes it invariably easier for the reader, who may wish try some of the more esoteric recipes, to find what one needs. It is little wonder that I love this magazine. Those who are interested in wonderful food, excellent and easy to follow recipes, other cultures and customs, as well as traveling, will simple adore this magazine. It makes a wonderful gift. I know, because this magazine was a gift to me and one for which I am grateful, as it is a gift that one gets to enjoy again and again, each and every month.",5
"I am a voracious reader of business periodicals.  I subscribe to and read four business magazines and three financial newspapers on a regular basis.  Between Forbes, Fortune and BusinessWeek, I always look most forward to receiving my next issue of Forbes.  Why?  Several reasons:
- The articles are generally shorter and more ""to the point"" than Fortune.  Forbes is also not as beholden as BusinessWeek is to cover the hot news stories.
- This magazine is the best of the three for discovering new investment ideas and it is generally more investor focused than either Fortune or BW.
- The editorials throughout the magazine are usually thought-provoking and I guarantee you will develop your own favorite columnists whom you will look forward to reading in each issue
- Forbes has a politically conservative and pro-business slant (with Steve Forbes as Editor-in-Chief, that should be no surprise).
- Forbes offers two supplemental issues, which are quarterly.  Forbes ASAP is entirely focused on technology and many articles are actually thought pieces written by influential executives, investors, and technology visionaries.  Forbes FYI features lighter articles which are thematically aimed at the upper class.  You will probably find some of the stories (and the ads) irrelevant to your life (we're not all millionaires yet, are we?).  But it's an amusing magazine and it's a good break for me from the stream of more business-oriented stuff I read.
I do enjoy all three of the major business magazines I mentioned.  But if you made me drop two of them, I'd keep Forbes. The reasonable price is just icing on the cake and gives you no excuse not to try it out.  I bet you'll be hooked.",5
"This is another magazine issue  cover that Im well aware is most likely going to change within 7-10 days. However, the 2015 Investment Guide Special Issue of Forbes Road Map To Riches; Your 32 Best Investment Ideas are also a treasure trove of a variety of information.  25 years of guaranteed income starts on page 108, buying a house in the suburbs page 120,  feature on investors and African economies starts on page 125, a feature on Brazil and their booming beauty business  starts on page 172, and a feature on umberto angeloni listed to be fashions comeback king and based out of Italy starts on page 178. Im also holding a special edition of Forbes that has the listing of the Forbes 400 (listed to be the identitive randking of the richest people in America) that was listed for display until January 5, 2015. Jerry yang is on the front of the cover and there is a feature listed to be a scorecard consisting of men and women who are self-made and those who are silver spoon.  An article on Business Aviation (pages  117-122), pages  130-132 feature the rankings of the 15th to the 19th richest people in America, and pages 168-174 feature the  167th to 190th richest. Forbes also has other special edition magazines such as the 2015 Investment Guide Special Issue of the Road Map To Riches titled Your Best 32 Investment Investment Ideas and listed to Display Until March 16, 2015. The Leader Board (page 32) and 25 Years of Guaranteed Income (starts on page 108) are some of the article features with the Forbes Special issue 2015 Investment Guide. As mentioned in a previous review, I would be fine with being employed until Im at least 85. The only reason why my husband and I are already planning to save enough money to comfortably retire by the late 2030s/early2040s is because of our shared belief that social security in the U.S. will not pay enough for even a cheap apartment  by the time the late 2040s/early 2050s roll around. Additionally, we are both aware that were part of a generation where retirement accounts are our responsibility, self-employment may be necessary and not just a take it or leave it option, and also preparing for the possibility of age related discrimination still existing for both the male and female genders of all races/ethnicities (especially with me being a minority woman).",5
"I have subscribed to ""Kiplinger's"" for a number of years now, and will continue to do so into the foreseeable future. The magazine is inexpensive, timely, and authoritative, and conveys complex financial concepts in easily comprehensible terms. The magazine is very in favor of long term, high quality stock market investing, and on a monthly basis covers something relevant to current investment issues in the stock market. It also covers important information on taxes, retirement, paying for tuition, mortgages, and making good car buying (or leasing) decisions.
The magazine is a great source of news as it is related to your financial life in ways that are sometimes obvious, and sometimes less so. For instance they have articles on annuities, which you would expect, but also on drug costs, which you might not. They also have extremely useful mutual fund performance charts in every issue, which I find to be among the best features in the magazine. With the passage of different tax laws, ""Kiplinger's"" writes on the practical implications of the Federal tax code changes as well as regularly looking at state tax issues.
There are many personal financial magazines covering many different areas available today. If you want only one that will give you the overall most valuable information per page, ""Kiplinger's"" would be tough to beat.",5
"Of all the magazines, this one has the best layout.

Whether you are looking for the latest news on your favorite star or are looking for a new recipe...this magazine has it all.

You know how many magazines say: ""Oh, we are going to tell you about...."" And five minutes later, you are still looking for ""that"" article. Well, in this magazine they have a great Contents page with a special: ""On the Cover"" section. So, if you want to read about Nicole Kidman she is on page 110! OK, that was in the November 2001 issue and it is quite a sad article. What ever happened to the fairy tale? I just don't know...

Now, if you love reading about other people who are making the news, the People section always has something fun to read about. Fashion and beauty gives ideas on the latest nail color or makeup tips. The articles on relationships are interesting.

This magazine also has sections for: Health & Well Being, Consumer Sense, The Better Way, Food & Home, Fiction, Departments and Columns. The TECH section is always of interest. There is a definite focus on women, as in: ""The Best Cell Phones for Women."" Plus, this is where you can find Heloise giving out the newest Household Tips.

My favorite page is the looks, trends, and news page where they always give you ideas for holidays or feature beauty products like Pumpkin Pie body wash in November. The recipes are often multicultural and you can find anything from Lebkuchen to Pavlova with Passion Fruit Sorbet.

In my top 10 of favorite magazines!

"The Artist's Magazine is full of advice and ideas for anyone studying or teaching art; from its first monthly department, ""Dialogue"", which is a question and answer column from readers, to the final page ""Master Class"", which gives the history and analysis of a famous work, you will get articles that cover many techniques and media, as well as guidelines on the business side of art.
Taking the March 2003 issue as an example, the cover story is on the exquisite gouache paintings of Daniel K. Tennant. One of the four works pictured is broken down and shown in six stages, from the initial layout to the final delicate details.
Artist Joseph Frassetta explains his technique in ""Reining it In"", and tells us what materials and tools he uses to create his realistic portraiture and animal studies.
There is another article on landscape painting through the four seasons, and others on doing a self-portrait, mixing the use of colored pencils, and so much more. Some favorite monthly articles are ""Art Clinic"" and ""Technical Q&A"", which always have useful tips.
The back of the magazine has classified listings of art related opportunities, workshops, etc., and even the ads can be an informative resource.
The Artist's Magazine also sponsors a yearly competition, with many categories, including a student/beginner division.
The magazine has medium weight paper, good color reproduction, and  teachers and students, especially of a traditional style of art, will find much to enjoy and learn in every issue.",5
"My Grandmother used to give me all her Sunset Magazines when she was done looking through them. Now my Aunt is carrying on the family tradition of keeping a subscription going.

A unique feature in this magazine is the Recipe Index. You can also find ideas for Travel and Recreation, Garden and Outdoor Living, Home and Design and of course Food and Entertaining. The monthly columns are quite unique. Like in the December 2001 issue, Peter Fish wrote an article about The voice of Christmas which is about Bing Crosby.

In the middle of the magazine, you can find a postcard that says: Information worth sending for. They do all the work for you...you just have to circle the information number to receive information on everything from International Travel to products you see advertised. They never leave you wondering where to find a unique product as they have a ""Sources: Where to Find It"" section.

The Holiday Section always has me dreaming! Who would not want to walk on the Multnomah Falls Trail in Oregon or stand on a log bridge over a river and just dream a day away. Sometimes I would just like to dissolve into some of the pictures. Especially the last issue, where they showed a cabin in the woods with Christmas Lights in Stehekin, Washington.

If you live in Washington, this is a MUST HAVE!

The January 2002 issue has an article on kayaks and a recipe for French Cream with Blueberry Pudding.

Reading this magazine is really almost a family traditon!

"Travel+Leisure Magazine is a fantastic magazine to subscribe to if you love to travel, and are open to various ideas of the possibilities of how to travel for relaxation. This magazine covers places from around the world of some of the best travel websites and hotels to stay at when you are traveling to many places in Europe, Asia, etc.  However, the one feature that I do LOVE about this magazine is how they feature a special issue just on Europe each year.  I treasure these ""special issues"" that cover Europe because places all across Europe are featured. For example, I feel very lucky to own the special issues that cover just Europe from the issues of May 2008, April 2009, and April 2010. The following are some of the features from these special issues that cover Europe:
1)In the May 2008 Travel+Leisure special issue of Europe there is a feature about the many travel gems to see in Vienna, Austria and 10 London, England restaurants that are recommended by British Food critic Paul Levy. There is also a fascinating article on ideas to consider for outdoor walking in France.
2) In the April 2009 Travel+Leisure Europe special issue there is a great feature on 22 Affordable European Hotels (my favorite visual feature is The Hotel Franziskaner in Zurich, Switzerland). There is a catchy article feature on the many places to visit in Lourdes, France.
3)In the April 2010 Europe feature there is a feature on Book Lover's London and a captivating article about Europe's best wine bars. I also like the 25 undiscovered European villages that are featured (the picture of the Staufen im Breisgau, a medieval town close to the Rhine Valley in southern Germany).
I very much look forward to the 2011 Europe Special issue that Travel+Leisure is going to create.

  The following are some of the exciting features of the February 2011 issue of Travel+Leisure:
 1) There is the feature of 25 of some of the most romantic dream trips (the country retreat of Coworth Park in Berkshire, England stands out in a good way for me).
2)There is a colorful article titled ""The Spirit of Dublin"" and some of the wonderful places to check out while in Dublin, Ireland (the cafe owner pictured on page 94 seems pretty joyful and content in her life).
3)On page 40 the fashion designer, hotelier, and Apprentice Star Ivanka Trump is featured. I do feel that it was a good idea to feature her because in my humble opinion she resourcefully utilizes the wealth and opportunities that are presented to her.

  Overall, Travel+Leisure is a great magazine to get for travel enthusiasts who love to dream and enjoy imagining the boundless opportunities that traveling brings.",5
"""Creativity is like life insurance. If you are creative, you are never afraid, because you can design yourself out of any situation."" ~Li Edelkoort

If you are interested in items like the Nissan Actic Concept Car (that has a matching trailer) or you want to discover new modern options for your bathroom, kitchen or garden, this magazine delivers.

DWELL has a variety of articles to interest the casual decorator or the seriously focused chef. For example, the April/May 2004 issue had articles on:

Home Cooking - a contractor and his three sons design a home with the kitchen at the heart of the home.

Cutting It Up - A downtown Los Angeles loft gets a makeover.

Stainless Chef - Designer John Picard finds a sanctuary with a high-tech steam oven and a hand-carved tub.

Victorian Revival - A San Franscico couple is the inspiration for a dramatic culinary renovations.

Trend Diva - Jane Szita talks about nesting and nihilism.

Other interesting articles include information on houses that become art, short reviews for books on subjects such as living in a small space.

I was intrigued by the house designed with mostly windows on page 45 and high tech enthusiasts will also love features for speakers or CD changers which are most modern.

Well, until I can afford a 9,500 buck oven, I'll keep reading and dreaming. The library in the April/May issue is to die for! Big windows and shelves galore.

Dwell is a magazine designed to inspire and inspire it did! Even some of the text is in color. The Marketplace section gives you a wealth of sources to encourage you to start on your own dream design, house or otherwise. The sourcing section also provides page by page information on sources.

"""Dwell"" is my favorite of all the design magazines I read regularly. It is a beautiful magazine with thoughtful and helpful illustrations, great articles, and interesting features. I am especially fond of the coverage of emerging trends in contemporary homes, particularly the coverage of prefab homes, culminating in the sponsorship of the ""Dwell Homes,"" which showcase outstanding contemporary prefabricated housing.

The advertisements are consistently relevant and interesting, and the magazine is good at keeping its edge with articles about relevant home furnishings, appliances, and other items that are frequently overlooked in other design magazines. I love the ""Modern Market"" section in the back of the magazine, dealing with unique products that are well targeted to the fan of the contemporary aesthetic. My only minor complaint is the occasional political agenda that appears in the articles, but it is relatively infrequent and confined to only a few (of a large number) of the contributors, like Pagan Kennedy. In general, though, the articles stay on topic and the editorial content is relevant and appropriately focused.

I look forward to getting several design magazines every month, but can honestly say that ""Dwell"" is my favorite of the bunch. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in contemporary architecture or design.",5
"As a child, I found this magazine when I couldn't pronounce ""geographic"", and adored the brilliant photography, scenery, strange-looking people and places, and was soon struggling to understand the text.  My imagination was seized by the Mayans, by the Caves of Lascaux, and always by dinosaurs and the other exotic plants and animals they showed me.  When I was a teenager my parents let me deface their old magazines to illustrate my papers on India, Japan, and anthropology.  I wanted to be an archeologist until I found out I'd have to learn a lot of languages, so history was a better choice for me.  Travel, geology, photography, and reading became passions.  Even as an adult, I sit down with the magazine and read it cover to cover the day it arrives, no matter what else I'm reading then.  Whenever I stumble on really old copies (the magazine is well over a century old), I read them to see how the magazine's point of view has developed.  This magazine has truly enriched my life.  My parents tried me out on various other magazines on nature, but this one is the real deal, and never talks down to me.

If you're interested in the world, the universe, the past, the future, and in life, this is the magazine for you.  Even though they have NG magazines for various ages of children now, a curious, eager child could appreciate the real one by ten.",5
"National Geographic is one of the best magazines of its kind, with plenty of great photography, thoughtful articles, and diverse coverage of several different topics relating to the planet earth. Stories about wildlife, different cultures, and even environmentalism and the politics it breeds can be found on the pages within each issue.

What makes this magazine so enjoyable is the fact that it goes so in- depth in its coverage and includes stories with a personal element. When most people think about National Geographic, they usually think about the great photographs of natural wonders, exotic plants, and animal wildlife. These things are all great, but they form only part of the magazine's overall appeal. Stories about different cultures and peoples from around the world are just as good, and are usually presented in a personal way. You feel like you know the people on an intimate level when you read this magazine.

This publication contains between 120 and 160 pages in most issues, with about a dozen or so monthly departments, as well as some varied articles that change each month, but are always concentrated on nature, science, politics, culture, etc.

National Geographic is often very educational and intellectual, making it a learning device as well as a magazine for entertainment. It's one of the better, more thorough magazines on the market. Go ahead and give it a try. You just might learn something in the process.",5
"This is a fine magazine with truly scrumptious recipes if you're into the kitchen/food thing, home ideas that one can actually use (or that will inspire one to do something similar), and exquisite photography, usually quite stark and simple, of ways to enhance the aesthetic beauty of one's life.
One can serve a plain meal of soup and bread, and make it look like a feast, if you get into Martha's way of looking at things, and it does not take a spending spree to have a ""Martha Look"". Her basic table settings tend to be white china (one can use mix and match white plates from the local thrift store), clear glass, and colorful fabric...add some well shaped twigs in a glass vase for a centerpiece, and voila ! you have a table that could be shown in this lovely magazine; a rule for ""The Look"" seems to be the absence of clutter.
Of the regular monthly articles, I like ""Ask Martha"", which solves problems posed by readers, from health issues to how best to clean your eyeglasses, to ""How can I get the coating on my chicken to stay in place when I am frying it ?"".
""Clip-Art Craft"" is another I appreciate, where in the August '04 edition for example, there are attractive templates for postcards, which one can copy onto card stock, glue a 4 x 6 photo to, and send to your friends. It's another grand idea from Martha !
You'll find articles on antiques, pets, gardening, seasonal fruits and vegetables, and much more, and on the last page, the yummy ""Cookie of the Month"".
Martha Stewart has brought style and good merchandise at affordable prices for those of us who are budget conscious, but like nice things. I have bought her bedding, and her bathroom accessories have graceful shapes and are an excellent value, and this magazine is one of my favorite aspects of the ""Martha industry"". The Patricians I know are not usually kind to Martha, but Proles & Plebes like me tend to greatly appreciate her.
Martha, we're going to stick by you through thick and thin !",5
"I have subscribed to Backpacker for more than a dozen years now.  Although I have tinkered with other outdoor, hiking magazines over the years, I have always held this one as my favorite.  In my opinion nobody does it better when it comes producing a publication for hikers and campers that just can't get enough of the great outdoors.  One thing I have always liked about this magazine the most is how it never fails to regularly return to the basics.  That is to say, it doesn't always assume that you are a seasoned hiker that well understands the joy and dangers of just getting away from it all in the wilderness.  It regularly carries a generous amount of articles and regular features that are fundamental enough for the novice reader or backpacker, as well as stories that deal with easier, family style hikes. It truly isn't all about just zeroing in on the big bear country adventures that the seasoned backpacker will prefer.  Though its true that there are more glossy style ads in it than ever before, as well as pull out subscription order cards and ads, (what magazine doesn't these days), it still in my opinion sticks to its guns very well in being a very interesting and excellently written magazine that I enjoy as much today as I did years back when I could actually do some of the hikes that it talks about.  I highly recommend Backpacker for its quality articles and photography, and tenaciousness in staying with what made it a great magazine all these years... : )",5
"Backpacker is an outstanding magazine for those who love to hike and also for those who enjoy paging through a magazine containing lots of enticing photographs of nature scenes. This magazine is, first and foremost, a publication for lovers of the outdoors and the sport of backpacking. But the pictures of mountains, lakes, streams, wildlife, etc., are enticing to anyone. They can quickly convert the non- outdoorsman type into a nature lover.
Besides the great pictures, Backpacker is also excellent for its product testing and for its advice and educational material. Backpacks, mountain bikes, tents, and so forth might seem like simple products, but you would be surprised at how many different varieties and options are available for this type of merchandise. Backpacker describes different items available for sale, complete with web site address and phone# so you can make a purchase, and it often conducts tests to see how the different products stack up. It also offers educational material on the sport of backpacking and general advice on such topics as food, exercise, proper nutrition, first aid, etc.
Backpacker averages between 90 and 120 pages in total length and it's published 9 times per year (three of the issues combine two months into one). It's one of the few special interest magazines I have read that has something to offer most anyone. Even if you don't like hiking, there is still a good chance you will enjoy thumbing through the pages of Backpacker, if nothing else, just to enjoy the great photography.
Overall, this is an outstanding outdoor publication. The articles, the personal stories, the advice, the photos, and the educational material all add up to a perfect magazine for anyone who loves to partake in outdoor activity or who just enjoys looking at the stunning photos. 5+ stars to Backpacker!",5
"Bird Watchers Digest is in my opinion a must have magazine for anyone that has any interest in birds.  From the backyard feeder to the world traveler observer, BWD has enough content in all areas to satisfy anyones particular interest, on any level.  There is even a regular section in each issue dedicated to back yard birding.  It isn't a magazine that is at all snobby and considers back yard novices peasants.  On the other hand, it is also a very technical and educational periodical for those that are advanced enough to actually take advantage of the many world wide travel suggestions and deals that are offered throughout the book. I first picked up some BWD back issues on Ebay and enjoyed it enough to order a regular subscription.  I was particularly impressed by its compact size, similar to Readers Digest.  It can be easily carried along in a purse or bag for traveling, and of course it makes a perfect addition to your bathroom library. The only caution that I would suggest to anyone that decides to buy a subscription is to pass on the offer of the digest newsletter that you can subscribe too for every other month that BWD isn't offered.  At $16 a for 6 issues it is not worth it at all.  Its a very thin, (about 10 pages) pamphlet style publication that has as many ads in it as helpful info.  Its a rip off in all honesty. I let my own subscription to it lapse after the first year.  You are much better off subscribing to the BWD email that is sent out periodically that is free, and loaded with article highlights and helpful info.  Overall I highly recommend BWD for all bird enthusiasts on all levels.  I think you will find yourself looking forward to each and every issue...",5
"I understand that the money magazine cover is going to change within a week. However, I currently have the December 2014 issue of money magazine  titled annual outlook issue make more money in 2015; great ideas that will help you prosper in the year ahead p. 64. Additionally, unintentionally spotting the article in this issue titled look better than a local, starts on page 44 cheered me up. This is because I know that I have to eventually move  regardless of how my employment picture would look in both the current and the new area, however I prefer to avoid sharing the when even though Im already somewhat aware of the timeline-because I would need to confirm with my husband and give my employer at least a two to three week notice on top of my intuitive and logical awareness that it may happen sooner than I expect. There is also some insightful information on getting mental health treatment, and the best fast path to a degree that is on page 81. Money magazine also publishes retirement features. For instance, the November 2014 Money magazine issue features an issue titled Retirement Guide 2015. Coping with The High Cost of Caregiving (starts on page 18) and philanthropy 101 (starts on page 40) are some of the features covered in the November 2014 Money magazine.  As mentioned in a previous review, I would be fine with being employed until Im at least 85. The only reason why my husband and I are already planning to save enough money to comfortably retire by the late 2030s/early 2040s or earlier is because of our shared belief that social security in the U.S. will not pay enough for even a cheap apartment  by the time the late 2040s/early 2050s roll around. Additionally, we are both aware that were part of a generation where retirement accounts are our responsibility, self-employment may be a necessity not just an option, and also preparing for the possibility of age related discrimination still existing for both genders of all ethnicities/races (especially with me being a minority woman).",5
"Honestly, there are some ""girls"" magazines on the market so risque, I feel like I should be wearing a trench coat and sunglasses purchasing them discreetly in DENMARK instead of the USA. One of them (I won't mention the title, but I'm sure many parents will recognize just from my description) claims it is for girls ages 8 to 14, but you'd swear by looking at the cover articles it would be meant for Playgirl readers. A few examples direct from the magazine are: Five Fresh Ways To Get That Guy, What's your flirt style?, Get your Best body. And it seems (well, most of the time it actually is) that the magazine's main focus is about how to get a guy or look good for him.
Now, as for DISCOVERY GIRLS, Just-The-Opposite!!! Here is a magazine I'd gladly get for any girl as a gift. It's main focus is on friendships, but it covers an array of issues of interest to girls ages 8 and up.
It covers fashion (and their fashions are modest/down to earth fashions), celebrities, fun projects, and social issues. A few examples of past articles include: Spotlight on Volleyball, ditched by your friends, win free stuff. Another plus about the magazine is that it is highly collectible!!!
So if you want a magazine you can feel comfortable giving your daughter as a gift or buying for someone else, you'll want to order DISCOVERY GIRLS today.",5
"I currently subscribe to three science magazines - Scientific American, Discover, and Science Illustrated. Of the three, I like Scientific American the best, but I must say that I enjoy all three.

Scientific American seems to have more of the lengthier feature articles that go into more depth on a particular subject. For instance, in the latest issue I am currently reading (Dec. 2011) there are nine feature articles covering a diverse array of subjects such as: technology, space exploration, biology, climate change, neuroscience, animal behavior, forensics, and education. I always find a number of articles that I am interested in reading in every issue.

Some articles I found very interesting in recent past issues are:

* Hidden Switches in the Mind - a fascinating article on epigenetics.
* Waiting for the Higgs - an article about the Large Hadron Collider and the search for the Higgs.
* The First Americans - who were these people and how did they get here.
* A Formula for Economic Calamity - an interesting article on Wall Street's betting our future on flimsy science.

There are also many departments covering various subject matter. In this issue, I count twelve departments. Some departments I find interesting are Advances, The Science of Health, Skeptic, and Recommended. These cover short special interest topics.

As a science aficionado, I can certainly recommend this magazine for those of you interested in the sciences.",5
"For a look at luxurious items, sumptuous homes, beautiful gardens, and food that could pass for art, this magazine has it all. Published 6 times a year, it has exquisite photography, and brilliantly colored, thick glossy pages. The layout is coordinated so well with the ads (which are thankfully unscented), that I sometimes confuse them with the articles, and the topics range from art, antiques, and travel, but the bulk of the publicatation is devoted to elegant homes and gardens.
Among the many articles in The July-August 2003 issue for instance, there is ""Masterworks: The Late Seascapes of Turner"", with some little known works by this great English artist; ""Coral, Beyond the Reef"", fabulous jewelry from the coastal region of Naples, Italy, and floral designs from Bella Flora in Dallas, where celebrities buy their gorgeous bouquets. There are no prices listed for any items in this magazine, because I imagine that if one has to ask, one can't afford it.
Five homes are featured, all different, all in their own way marvelous, from an old Atlanta mansion filled with curious antiques, to a bright and modern, sparsely furnished London home with pistachio walls and lots of light.
As Editor-in Chief Lisa Newson says in ""The View from Veranda"", ""Color is magic"", and this magazine serves up a lot of it...a feast for the eyes, and a glimpse of lavish living.",5
"VERANDA reigns along with the other three most beautiful and stylish U.S. shelter magazines today: Architectural Digest, Elle Decor and House Beautiful. What I like about VERANDA is the photography and rooms dominate and the text takes a supporting role.  The magazine features many full-page and double-page spreads of gorgeous rooms with not a lot of text interrupting.  Design is one of the fields in which you can learn by just studying a room in detail to get a sense of the scale, proportion, balance of texture and light and shadow etc.

You are training your eye in what the best designers find beautiful.  A full and double-page spread allows you to do that better than smaller, choppier photos. It's great to have more visual, less words in which the rooms triumph. More to see--less to read. There's enough text in VERANDA to get into the designers'/homeowners' minds. VERANDA'S lush heavy paper stock is a joy, too, and increases the aesthetic experience.  The photos of the rooms look spectacular on it.

VERANDA features eclectic styles and locations.  This month, for example, the magazine showcases a townhouse in Georgetown, a Park Avenue apartment, a Parisian pied-a-terre, a Florida ocean-front home and a Normandy-inspired Atlanta home along with a Cotswold garden. There's a mix of styles from Provencal antiques to Art Deco to a soft, tailored modern. It's a monthly infusion of visual beauty and grace. (As an aside: I love buying my shelter magazines through Amazon as I've been able to get great subscription prices and track my subscriptions so I don't miss a single issue, which is helpful when you subscribe to lots of magazines.)

Under new editor Dara Caponigro's vision, VERANDA magazine sings and soars.",5
"My sons, who both have degrees in Economics - one is getting a PhD in Economics - recommended that I read this magazine.  One son said he wished I would read it so we could discuss it.  Anytime your offspring want to talk to you, that's an incentive.

I am impressed with the organization of this magazine. It opens with The world this week and Leaders and Briefing. It is then organized by geography: United States, The Americas, Asia, China, Middle East and Africa, Europe, Britain and International with a special section on Brazil in this issue.  Then it covers topics: Business, Finance and economics, Schools brief, Science and technology, Books and arts and Economic and financial indicators.

I like the global perspective this magazine offers with the U.S. just being one player.  Articles are deep and comprehensive with information that isn't easily available elsewhere in mainstream publications.  This week the cover article is on the extraordinary comeback of al-Qaeda and how it holds sway over more territory and is recruiting more fighters than any time in its 25 year history.  In Iraq since we left prematurely, the magazine indicates, over 1000 civilians a month are being murdered by al-Qaeda.  Al-Qaeda wants to bring Iraq, Syria and Lebanon together into a single caliphate.  Those are just some of the interesting facts in this magazine. While reading it, I felt I was immersed in a high-level course in international politics and economics.

If you read this magazine every week, in a short time you would be up to date and literate on global issues and economics.

I enjoyed the book review of the new book on Salinger in this issue.

If you read every article thoroughly, it would take several hours.  My son likes to read it on the train to New York City and gets it in paper and online form.  I'll be reading it weekly now so I can discuss it with my sons.",5
"Yes.

It is expensive.  No matter how you get it.  The best deal regularly offered is through the website.  If you're affiliated with an academic institution, you can get it for around seventy-seven dollars for a whole year.  This, as far as I understand, is for all levels and both sides of the dais.  I don't know how strict they are on checking up on that, but as far as I've seen, it is only offered through the website.

It is worth it.  They identify as a center-right 'newspaper' in England.  This makes it somewhat of a center-left paper in the States.  My own politics are further to the left than the editorial voice of The Economist, but for my money there is no better weekly news magazine.  I grew up stealing my father's Time and Newsweek magazines.  I liked them, but have over time shifted towards focusing on popular culture and towards a dumbed down-audience.  Perhaps my own expectations grew to be more curious about the world than what the actors on 'Friends' thought about their success.

The Economist meets those expectations.  They cover the world, in depth.  They're still something of an establishment voice, so if you want to reinforce your left or right radical leanings, you need to seek another publication to supplement your views.  I for one, keep the Monthly Review.  I tried to do it all in one publication, but I dropped the Nation because it was over-focused on the American Left, and I felt silo-ed.

The depth is the selling point.  There are several sections covering Africa, Latin America, the U. S., Britain, general economic news, science, and the arts.  Each of these sections contain several articles, with a section-closing editorial from the Economist's editorial teams.

The depth is the biggest drawback though.  There's so much there that if you want to read it cover-to-cover, it is a good investment of your time.  Overall, I think it is well worth the investment in time and money.",5
"Please understand that I am only sharing my journey towards fulfilling some of my personal fitness goals and this review is only a symbol representing and acknowledging that I still have so much to learn. As per a recent confirmation phone call,I humbly admit that this current  (June 2014) magazine issue was gifted to me from a company affiliated with Capital Media as a free promotional issue. I was actually trying to figure out what fitness magazine to help me along with my goals (especially due to helping me continue my progress since losing 25 pounds after starting my current job in October 2013). I actually prayed for the best magazine to assist me in my goals and strangely enough this magazine was sent to me for free shortly afterwards.  I have in front of me the June 2014 issue which has Miranda Lambert on the front cover. On pages 55-59, she bravely shares what she went through in her weight loss journey and is compassionate for others who have more weight to lose. From my modest perspective, Miranda Lamberts interview for this issue of Womens Health is very candid and inspirational. Pages 60-62 cover some of Miranda Lamberts physical fitness techniques  (as given to her by her trainer Bill Crutchfield). Page 124 shows an interview with Seth Meyers while pages 126-127 is a juicy article written to explain why many women are secretly bad girls. There are also some recipes for grilling on pages 167-171.",5
"If you're looking for a magazine which offers a mix of current styles popular in interior design today, ELLE DECOR offers a great mix and is among my favorite interior design magazines along with HOUSE BEAUTIFUL, ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST, VERANDA and COUNTRY LIVING. I never let my subscriptions to these lapse. I team-teach interior design to adults and am always looking for stylish rooms, the latest design trends, and beautiful images to share with the class. ELLE DECOR delivers. It's very high style. I anticipate its arrival each month.

The magazine is great for training your eye as to what's interesting, stylish and beautiful in today's design world. If you are wanting to update any tired and boring rooms in your home, or rooms you're bored with, it's great for showing you what's new or being reinterpreted in a fresh way. Then you can sample what appeals to you.

Taste is about exposure and ELLE DECOR exposes you to what top designers are doing today so you can incorporate the elements you like in your own home. Many of the top designers are featured every month. Diverse rooms and styles in varied colors from monochromatic to bright colors are highlighted each month. One great exercise is to challenge yourself to find something you like in each room even if you don't particularly like a room--it can be a lamp, a rug, a pillow, or piece of art, but you begin articulating and stretching your taste. If you're looking for fresh, sophisticated, intriguing design, consider a subscription.",5
"I love the content of this magazine. It's a good balance of articles about interior decorating, landscaping and curb appeal, food and places to visit in the south. This magazine provides enough content that it takes me more than one sitting to finish it all, which I think is a good thing.

BTW, when I signed up for this magazine, I wasn't sure what they meant by ""southern"". Subsequently, I learned that this magazine caters to people as far north as Maryland. West Virginia is included too. In other words, this magazine caters to an audience that is wider than I first thought, which I think is a good thing.

I also like the current editor a lot - I think he does a good job of balancing the need to keep the magazine relevant / current with the desire to tie the new issues into the larger Southern Living legacy. He lets the magazine celebrate tradition without being overly stuffy or being overly resistant to change and/or modern tastes. In other words, the magazine keeps its unique voice but also stays fresh/current too.

One additional comment is that Southern Living always has lovely covers. I know its just the cover, but it always makes me want to dive right in and enjoy the rest of the issue! The covers are consistently beautiful and also do a good job of representing the content inside the magazine.",5
"I highly recommend this magazine for working or stay at home moms. There is truly a little bit of everything.  Inexpensive fashion, makeup tips, healthcare, nutrition, fitness, relationships, family, etc... It doesn't prefer one to the other and there are useful tips jotted all over the place that are truly useful. There are very few ads in the magazine and the ones they do have usually come with useful coupons.  It seems to market young moms ages 25-40.  I am 31 and when this magazine comes in the mail, I honestly read it front to back.  No useless stories or expensive fashion that is out of my reach.  I just hope it stays as consistent and true to the market they are reaching.  Thanks All You!!!

7/29/08 UPDATE:  I just reordered this for another 2 years.  This magazine is still great and I actually start thinking about when another issue will be hitting my mailbox which hasn't happened since I was a teen.

Top 10 Favorite Parts:
1. Sudoku, Futoshiki, Crossword and Picture Puzzles in every issue
2. Table of Contents shows a picture of the front cover with page numbers for each tag - quick to flip to what interests you.
3. Easy layout to read. There are ordered sections called You Self, Your Health, Your World, Your Home, Seasonal, and In Every Issue.
4. Normal everyday people - no stick figure models in the this mag.
5. Fashion, decorating and make-up suggestions are all normal brands at normal stores (Target, Macy's, Gap, Walmart, Old Navy, LLBean, Pier 1)
6. Little fluff and most of the ads that are in there have coupons
7. Safe enough to leave on the table around kids (no kinky stuff)
8. Just enough family and kid-fun info but majority appeals to women so you don't feel so mommyish readying it
9. No gossip or celebrity picture.  I don't buy anything that pays scummy paparazzi.
10.  I can read it from beginning to end the first day and still go back to the issue multiple times thru the month for decorating, fashion and recipe ideas.  Great value

I normally don't write long reviews but this is truly a great magazine!

EDIT:  7/7/09 - BEFORE you order this magazine PLEASE look over the time it takes to get your first one in the mail.  Amazon states it takes 6 to 10 weeks from the day you purchase right at the top of the page.  All the 1 star reviews are from idiots who are mad their magazine hasn't come yet and ""it's been a whole month!""  Stop leaving poor reviews because it isn't All You's fault or Amazon's - it is your own fault for not reading the obvious print on how long it takes to arrive.  Be patient.  It is a great magazine and doesn't deserve the bad 1 star reviews for people's lack of common sense.

EDIT: 7/5/13 - I still order and read this magazine every single month.  I think the content has stayed the same but I think there are a few less coupons than before.  The only place you can pick this magazine up in the stands is at Walmart.  And yes, it still takes a long time to get this magazine like every other magazine from Amazon.  You can get it a few weeks quicker going directly to their publishing department but I like the magazine subscription reminder thru Amazon as opposed to getting paper mail from publishers.  Earth friendly and easier to remember.",5
"""Food Network Magazine"" is my favorite culinary periodical. I am a fan of some of the celebrity chefs on Food Network, and this magazine is good on covering them in interviews and showcasing their recipes and cooking techniques. The magazine is very hefty and is printed on high quality glossy stock; that combined with the first class photography inside makes readers motivated to improve their cooking game and try their hand at new dishes and methods.

I'm a dedicated follower of Alton Brown, whose culinary creativity and methodologies are singularly amazing, and also love the food from Bobby Flay, Michael Symon, and Aarn Snchez (whose knowledge and use of spices and particularly peppers is without peer.) Honestly there are few of the chefs who I don't enjoy hearing from, and most issues are worth a solid cover to cover perusal. I like the visual elements of the magazine: the ""Recipe Index"" has a page number and photo of all the dishes in an issue, and the ""Star Search"" feature has pictures of the celebrities in an issue with the pages they appear on. There are many routine features that I love, but none as much as the well-illustrated recipes section. I particularly enjoy the ""You Asked"" section where the star chefs answer reader questions: sometimes these tips can prove extremely useful.

I gave the magazine five stars though there are a few things less than perfect. The magazine, like most similar publications, has a ton of advertising, though much of it is relevant and unobjectionable. Each issue has a theme: normally this theme is a welcome centering device, but sometimes it is excessive as are some of the features. A recent edition had more coverage of deviled eggs than anyone could ever want (and I like deviled eggs,) while some of the articles are of little practical use (I'm not interested in Penn Jillette's colorful kitchen, for instance, though I am sure some readers are.) Regardless of these quibbles, I still greatly enjoy ""Food Network Magazine"" and look forward to every new issue. I recommend it to cooks (of all experience levels) and fans of Food Network everywhere.",5
"I have been subscribing to The Food Network Magazine,(FNM) for almost a year now.  Down through the years I have subscribed to several cooking magazines, and for one reason or another have eventually let them drop.  Every one I know, or have subscribed too were bi monthly magazines that mostly contained some cute little departments in them that were fun to read, but mostly a whole lot of recipes.  True recipe magazines aren't a bad thing if you enjoy just holding something in your hand the old fashioned way, but if its really recipes only your after, the online world is absolutely infested with huge sites where that is all they have and do.  I just never felt I got enough beyond the recipes in the other magazines to ever make them worth keeping...

FNM is a whole different periodical.  Its more like a trade journal of the food network, and culinary industry in general.  All done in a nice easy, fun to read, colorful and entertaining style.  Its like being on the inside of the food channel, back stage where for most of us that love the food network, always wish we could be in any event.  I think its pretty much safe to say if you love the food network, or just love cooking, you will find this magazine immensely entertaining.  Its full of behind the scenes glimpses of the personalities, sets, production, and operation of all the shows we love to watch, as well as interviews, informative information, and a good dose of humor as well.  It also has a nice set up of every month departments where you can ask your questions, get reviews on new books and equipment, and get loads of tips on just about every kind if food or cooking that you can imagine.  Finally, despite what some other reviewers have expressed here as it being short on recipes, FCM still packs a good number of them into every issue, (even more starting about 7 issues ago). They also spread the recipes out as to dispensing them pretty evenly among all the different stars that have shows.  Therefore if you favor a certain personality or show, you will find something from them regularly.  Personally one thing I love about this magazine as to its take on recipes is that they don't seem to concentrate so much of sweets and desserts.  Seems like every magazine and cookbook I have ever owned deems is necessary to have a whole section devoted to just desserts.  I much prefer more in the way of recipes for real food, which FNM does a good job of delivering.  The recipes I have actually gotten around to trying from its pages have all turned out to be delicious, as you might expect.

Lastly there are two others things worth mentioning if your considering subscribing to this FNM, and doing it here on Amazon.  The first is that FNM is published 10 times a year, or 3 more times than all other cooking magazines I know.  I like the fact that it comes every month but two.  (And trust me, this is a slightly over size, thick magazine, not just a thin thumb through).  Finally, I originally subscribed to this magazine through one of those subscription service sites on the web that claims to always have the lowest prices around.  I paid $18 for my subscription, and as of this writing it is still going for that price online, while here on Amazon its currently $15.  A pretty good savings for what it is.  I not only highly recommend this fun entertaining and informative magazine, but I also recommend you buy it right here on Amazon. I certainly will be when my subscription renewal comes around. I am immensely enjoying my Food Network Magazine, and I really think you will like it too...",5
"The weekly bible of everything entertainment, from movies, TV, music , video games and books (among other things). I have been s subscriber for nearly 15 years and although I do not agree with many of their reviews, there is always something interesting to read in the magazine. The only thing that irks me a lot is their opinion that THE WALKING DEAD is the best TV show on the air since the invention of sliced bread. Any intellectual viewer will see that the characters come directly out of Stereotypes 101 and the plots are nothing but recycled George Romero and countless other zombie films, but they always manage to put a story or photo of the series in every issue. Whomever thought that this was the best show ever on TV really needs to watch more TV. Even the worst episode of THE X-FILES makes the best episode of THE WALKING DEAD look like the worst episode of WHO'S THE BOSS. Just because a TV show has taboo-breaking gore on it does not make it a great series. What about M*A*S*H, THE WIRE, THE SOPRANOS, ST. ELSEWHERE, OZ, JUSTIFIED, THE AMERICANS, GAME OF THRONES, AMERICAN HORROR STORY or any other good show that made or makes TV worthwhile? To EW, they are nothing but chickenfeed when put next to THE WALKING DEAD. Like I said, that is really my only complaint about the magazine, but it is enough of an annoyance whenever I see I cover on the zine devoted to the show (and there have been many!). They do have a good staff of writers and make me laugh every now and then, so I give them a pass when it comes to TWD. It's a great zine at a very affordable price if you have it renewed every year. You pay like $0.49 an issue. A real bargain.",5
"I've been reading Entertainment Weekly for about twenty years now, and although it's gone through a lot of changes, it's basically still my favorite magazine to receive and to read. It's a sort of a good mix of pop culture *plus* a teeny, tiny bit of gossip, but the *""interesting"" kind, meaning- you won't find out about Snooki's latest drama, but you will get the scoop on how a much anticipated Hollywood franchise might be headed for trouble.

The best thing about EW is their coverage of upcoming movies, books, television, music, and stage, plus interesting articles on the business of entertainment- everything from in depth coverage of TV shows to an inside look at a much anticipated film to long interviews with directors, etc.

The only thing I don't like about the magazine is that it's starting to get very web and tablet focused- meaning, the content of the magazine is slowly getting leaner and leaner, and on every other page there's a reminder to check the EW website or iPad edition for the rest of the features. I'm not happy about this- I really like it when they had about six or eight pages of movie reviews. I'm not happy that now it's four pages of movie reviews, and two of those pages are tiny ""one sentence"" reviews and charts. It's the same for books and television and other media, as well.

Regardless, I still eagerly dive into every issue that pops into my mailbox, and out of all the magazines I start and drop subscriptions to, this is the only one I really consider ""necessary"". I love that I know about every movie, television show, and CD before they even get released.",5
"I received this magazine as a packaged subscription with Money magazine. At first I figured I would just skim through the issues until the subscription ran out, but after reading the first issue, I was hooked. That was several years ago. I thought it would just be a lot of boring articles about business and that I wouldn't be interested. Quite to the contrary, in each issue I would find at least one or two articles on various businesses that I found quite interesting. For example, in the latest issue (July 21, 2014) there was an article on the future of Instagram and one on the visionary founder of HTC including some of the issues the company is facing; I found both these articles of pertinent interest to me.

Fortune also covers many topics of interest to anyone concerned about the economy, financial markets, and interesting people. This particular issue had an article on how big time companies were moving their ""headquarters"" overseas to avoid paying taxes. There was much beneficial information on this ongoing problem and its causes - and a list of the top ten avoiders. There are also very thought-provoking commentaries by Alan Sloan, Sheila Bair, Beck Quick, Nina Easton, and others.

Fortune provides a quick overview of what's going on in business, the economy, and the financial markets, and often times has some very interesting stories about prominent people or current issues. You can also get the digital version to read on a tablet if you have the paper subscription. That's a nice bonus.",5
"Spa Parties and T-shirts that say ""Delish"" are very much a part of Rachael's magazine complete with pullout recipe cards and travel features. The recipe cards all have shopping lists on the back, so you can grab the cards and head to the grocery store. There is also a handy recipe index organized by categories at the end of the magazine.

The Kids recipe section encourages young cooks to participate in family meals. This issue had a recipe for a delicious tuna salad with roasted red pepper and grape tomatoes. Just for Kids tips give ideas for how to juice a lemon and there are cute kid comments about the recipes.

Everyday with Rachael Ray embraces life and does it with a realistic flair. In the June/July issue, ideas for picnics include shopping lists and recipes for Melon Skewers with Orange-Lime Marinade. Roy Yamaguchi cooks at home with his family and offers recipes like Miso Cod with Buttered Mushrooms.

What I like most about this magazine is the realistic recipes complete with everyone cooking and enjoying life. The pictures are spontaneous and the series of pictures for the Ice Cream Cake are step-by-step heaven. Just when you think this magazine has everything you could wish for, an Everyday Menu Planner appears to give recipes and shopping lists. Grilled Shrimp with Cucumber Salad and Smoked Turkey Panini are must-have recipes for the summer. Peaches resting on a marshmallow meringue are perfect for dessert after the Baby Back Ribs with Jammy Glaze.

This is a magazine about cooks, chefs and Rachael's recipes. The ""Ask Rachael"" section gives you a chance to send in e-mails to ask Rachael about her life or to have your foodie question answered in the magazine. She also has decorating advice so now you know what to do with the shells you collected at the beach (or you could find them at Pier 1).

What is the best feature in this magazine besides the recipes? ""What is in the refrigerator of your favorite Celeb?"" I'm always intrigued.

If you collect cookbooks, there are many featured in this inspired magazine. The advertising doesn't seem to overtake the pages and is subtly blended in so it feels very natural and interesting.

~The Rebecca Review",5
"I have several magazines that I consult for my reading enjoyment and/or enlightenment. With most of them, I thumb through and focus only on articles that seem interesting, but there are a few magazines that seem to hit the mark so consistently that I read the almost the entire issue month after month. One good example of the latter is Archaeology Magazine.

What sets this magazine apart from most others is the content itself. Yes, there are some cool illustrations but where Archaeology Magazine shines is with the articles themselves. They are packed full of fascinating information and they enrich your knowledge of history. And I don't mean refresh your knowledge- I mean enrich, because much of what you read here is going to involve historical facts you likely never heard before. I come away from every issue learning something brand new about a specific era in world history and the cultures that lived and thrived during that time.

Archaeology Magazine has very few advertisements. Most of them are clustered at the end of each issue, so you get uninterrupted reading from start to finish. Another thing I love is that most of the articles are not excessively long. Some are only a half- page or less. At most, they might cover four pages tops. I like this, because Im the type who may not want to commit to a long, say, 10 page magazine article. I read some magazine with long articles like this and the moment I see that its going to be this long- and I always check before I start reading- I often skip the article completely.

Yet another reason to love Archaeology Magazine is the quality of the writing. The editors make sure each article is clear and concise, with proper grammar and clarity. The articles are educational and they maintain an academic style. Youre not going to find much in the way of humor or other creative forms of non- fiction prose. No, Archaeology Magazine sticks with the facts and presents them in and informative way that archaeology and history enthusiasts will appreciate.

I usually skim through most magazines, but Archaeology Magazine is different. It is one of the very few magazines that maintain my interest from beginning to end, with every article worthy of a read. Try this magazine for yourself, and get enlightened on the fascinating world we live in and all of its glorious past.",5
"This Magazine is my #1 Favorite out of all 16 subscriptions that I had received within the past 4 years.
As the other reviews mentioned it goes into such detail that I often times carry it along as reading material for myself when I'm going out of town. I have bought this as gifts for at least 4 friends of mine in the last 2 years alone. I really enjoy the time the writers take in the Test Kitchen's explaining the ""why"" and the ""how"" the recipes work or doesn't for that matter. I find that this is one of those Magazine that is worth every penny no matter how much the cost. They review cookbooks and in their very own in depth fashion, go into detail in describing how they test the recipes in these cookbooks. And for someone like myself that buy at least 5 cookbooks per month this cuts down on the cost of buying books full of recipes that really aren't tested. I find it interesting when they ""test"" various products and appliances... I can't even begin to express what a value this subscription is all I can say is that every person I purchase this for has renewed their subscription on their own.
So what does that tell you huh?
BTW You can always purchase the Cookbook index that they put out at the end of every year it has every issue that came out.
Happy Reading",5
